She lives in the San Vicente department along with her husband, a city employee, and their two adult daughters, who help their mother with her business. \r\n\r\nSantos makes and sells tortillas out of her home and has many customers. She also works every afternoon cooking classic regional dishes such as fried yucca, 'atol' (a spiced corn-based beverage), and 'pastelitos' (pastries made from puff pastry with a sweet or savory filling), among others. This work allows Santos to provide her husband with financial support so that they can build a better future for their family. This is why she has requested a loan. With these funds, she will be able to purchase supplies for food preparation."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":716286,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase of supplies for food preparation.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"San Vicente, San Vicente","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2011-02-21T07:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Santos Pilar","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-02-02T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":625,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2011-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2011-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2011-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2011-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2011-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2011-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2011-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2011-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2011-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2012-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2012-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2012-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":34.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.76}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":34.72,"local_amount":34.72,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:10:49Z","rounded_local_amount":34.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201228343,"comment":null},{"amount":34.72,"local_amount":34.72,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-20T07:45:21Z","rounded_local_amount":34.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206733198,"comment":null},{"amount":34.72,"local_amount":34.72,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-16T08:00:08Z","rounded_local_amount":34.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211388517,"comment":null},{"amount":34.72,"local_amount":34.72,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-20T07:48:16Z","rounded_local_amount":34.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216448677,"comment":null},{"amount":486.12,"local_amount":486.12,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:14:02Z","rounded_local_amount":486.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221612765,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-02-21T10:34:20Z","paid_date":"2011-08-15T08:14:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":275114,"name":"Sem","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sem S., 43, is married and lives with her child in Kampong Cham province, Cambodia \u2013 an area known for its rubber plantations.

She also sells 'chiles rellenos' (stuffed mild chili peppers) on weekends (Saturdays and Sundays), door to door in her community to her friends and neighbors.

Mayra and her family live in the La Atalaya community, which is 15 minutes from Tierra Blanca in the state of Veracruz.\r\n\r\nShe tells us that a little over three years ago she was thinking about working to help her husband with the household expenses.  However, she did not want to neglect her house or her son.  So she started her own business selling cosmetics and perfumes by catalog.  She sells in the afternoons by going door to door in her community.  She also goes to nearby communities like MataNaranjo and the Echeverria and Progereso neighborhoods.\r\n\r\nMayra first takes her catalogs to her customers.

A., is a driver by profession who rents a rickshaw that he drives. Through the rickshaw, he provides transport to passengers and receives his fares according to the distance of the destinations. He has been in this profession for 9 years.  \r\n\r\nAsma has applied for a loan from Kiva partner Asasah for her husband\u2019s business. With the loan, he will buy a rickshaw and start his own transportation business.  Driving a rented rickshaw is disadvantageous because it is not always available for him to drive for longer hours.  With his own rickshaw, he can set his schedule to earn maximum income. \r\n\r\nAsma is a regular loan user of Asasah and this is her third loan application. In previous loans, she has maintained good credit and never missed a meeting.\r\n\r\nNote: In the photo, the woman holding a book (the Asasah Passbook) is Asma."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":716478,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Rickshaw","sector":"Transportation","use":"To buy a

Through hard work, she has managed to build her own home. As well as taking care of her home, Celia raises animals such as guinea pigs and chickens which she sells in the neighbourhood. She has some land too but only grows food for herself. \r\n\r\nShe plans to use the loan to buy materials to complete the parts of her house that remain unfinished. Her goal is to expand her guinea pig business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":716711,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"to buy construction materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2011-02-21T16:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Celia Guillermina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":660,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":55}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:01:50Z","rounded_local_amount":112.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201284091,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:59:59Z","rounded_local_amount":112.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206152000,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:14:08Z","rounded_local_amount":112.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211224836,"comment":null},{"amount":168.75,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:04:51Z","rounded_local_amount":168.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216503625,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:47:22Z","rounded_local_amount":112.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221667600,"comment":null},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T09:10:29Z","rounded_local_amount":56.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227036457,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-02-21T22:38:58Z","paid_date":"2011-09-15T09:10:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":275236,"name":"Vista Alegre Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El comit\u00e9 \u201cVista Alegre\u201d se form\u00f3 con la uni\u00f3n de varias vecinas de la ciudad de Santani.

is a 34-year-old married woman who supports her family by operating two business ventures:  fishing and food vending.  She lives in the municipality of Medellin, Cebu. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2008 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 4,000. Dima is borrowing PHP 10,000 to continue to fund the operations of her business. This will be her sixth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 5,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Dima aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

is a married woman who lives in Cauayan, Negros Occidental.

Jonah joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past five loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Jonah has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 1,500 after paying all loans and less expense, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her sixth loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000, which she intends to use as additional working capital to continue to save up for future house repairs and business expansion. Jonah is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

Primitiva is the group leader of this three-member group loan offered by PMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all responsible for paying back the loan of their fellow group members if they are delinquent or default. The official name of this borrowing group is Primitiva E.\u2019s Group.\r\n\r\nPrimitiva is married to Lerio E., a motor cab driver. They are blessed with five adult children, two of whom are married.\r\n\r\nTo help her husband, Primitiva decided to engage in a micro-business operating a sari-sari (variety) store in addition to doing some farming activity. For a year, she has been able to maintain this business activity and is now earning an average net income of not less than P3,500 a month, which is very helpful to her family.\r\n\r\nPrimitiva joined the Cooperative in 2009.  She is an active member of the PDP-LP (Paglaum Development Program for Landless People) Program of Paglaum MPC, a micro-finance program that reaches out to the rural poor.  Primitiva is requesting a loan in the amount of P10,000 for her 4th loan from PMPC. Part of this loan will be used to purchase commercial fertilizers and the remaining amount will be used for motor maintenance.\r\n                                                                                                                                                                 \r\nThe future income from this loan will be used to improve the living conditions for Primitiva\u2019s family, to meet their basic needs, to repay loans from PMPC, and to use for possible business expansion. \r\n\r\nAbout Group Loans:  In a group loan, each member of the group receives an individual loan but is part of a group of individuals bound by a group guarantee. Under this arrangement, each member of the group supports one another and is responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.

She earns her living by operating a general store. Her husband Rany, who is 40 years old, works in maintenance on a ship to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities. They have three children who are between 3 and 12 years old. Mary Ann joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Mary Ann has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 14,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 2,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her fifth loan, she is borrowing PHP 18,000 to use as additional working capital so that she could continue to save up for her children's future education. Mary Ann is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She lives in Candoni, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2009 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 6,000. Mary Joy is borrowing PHP 25,000 to purchase more stocks to sell.  This will be her sixth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 18,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Mary Joy aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

To make a living, she raises pigs for fattening and sale. She has been engaged in her business for over eight years and earns approximately $95 every three months.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Ginalyn joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. \r\n\r\nGinalyn is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nVirginia is married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Virginia owns and operates a general store, selling food and daily use products in the local community. Virginia has been engaged in her business for over 15 years and earns approximately 8,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Virginia joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her business and living situation. Virginia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 25,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional inventory and for working capital. Virginia is requesting a new loan of 30,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the sixth loan taken out by Virginia from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Naddy is a Community Partner of CCT* in Dasmarinas, Cavite, where she and her husband, Eleomar, raise their family. Eleomar is a tricycle driver. They have two children, one of whom is in elementary school while the younger one is not yet attending school. Naddy reached only high school, but it does not mean she cannot perform well as a micro-entrepreneur.\r\n\r\nAt present, Naddy runs her own ready-to-wear (RTW) business. She started small, with her house as her working space. She would buy clothes which she thought would fit the taste of her potential customers, and sell them to friends, neighbors, and business connections. She also does direct selling, offering her customers products from beauty brands, such as Avon and MSE.  With these entrepreneurial efforts and the daily tricycle operation of Eleomar, their family earns around Php12,000 per month.\r\n\r\nTo help her grow her business, Naddy decided to borrow Php16,000. She plans to use this money to buy additional quantities of the affordable, yet quality, products that her customers look for. She knows that having enough capital on hand will enable her to purchase the orders for her valued customers even without initial down payments.\r\n\r\nNaddy is surely not exempted from the challenges of direct selling, such as delayed payments. But rather than focusing on her problems, Naddy instead focuses on making her business grow from a small beginning to big time growth. She hopes to have her own commercial space where more potential customers are within an arm\u2019s reach. She also desires to have her own tricycle. For her family, she desires good health and a sustained education for her children.\r\n\r\nAs a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she received.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":716819,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To

With the help of her past 19 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Virginia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 20th loan, she is borrowing PHP 19,500 to buy fresh fish so that she can continue to save up for future family needs.

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Arceli B. is from the village of Cabisera 25, Ilagan, Isabela. She is 46 years old. Arceli is the group leader of a 8-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Arceli B..\r\n\r\nArceli is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Arceli owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for fattening and sale. Arceli has been engaged in her business for over 15 years and earns approximately 3000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Arceli joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Arceli has successfully repaid a previous loan of 15,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise & sell in the future. Arceli is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP, which will be used to purchase breeding livestock. This loan will be the 7th loan taken out by Arceli from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva

She earns her living by operating a general store. Her husband Rony, who is 43 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities. They have no children. Nora joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 14 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Nora has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 9,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 1\/000 after paying her amortization and less expense, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 15th loan, she is borrowing PHP 14,000 to use as additional capital for her sari-sari store so that she can continue to save up for future expansion of her business. Nora is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Aside from agricultural investments, she runs a sari-sari store as well. Delia does all these activities to provide for her big family. She said that it is not easy to sustain a big family like hers, but it gets lighter because she shares the burden with her husband.\r\n\r\nDelia is in need of farm inputs, hog and poultry feeds.

is a 51-year-old married woman who supports her family by operating two business ventures:  a sari-sari (general) store and copra. She lives in the municipality of Brooke's Point, Palawan. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2004 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her sari-sari (general) store and copra businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average income of PHP 12,500. Elvira is now borrowing PHP 13,000 so that she could purchase more stock. This will be her 23rd loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom.

She earns her living by operating a pig fattening business and a fishing business. Her husband Jerry, who is 46 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities. They have three children who are between 13 and 20 years old. Sandra joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1998 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 15 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Sandra has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 16th loan, she is borrowing PHP 22,000, which she intends to use as additional working capital so that she can continue to save up for future business expansion and her children's education. Sandra is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

is a married woman who lives in Bantayan, Cebu. She earns her living by fishing and fish vending. Her husband Rogelio, who is 46 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities. They have seven children who are between 2 and 19 years old. \n\nElsa joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1997 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 15 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Elsa has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. \n\nHer previous loan of PHP 23,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 20,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 16th loan, she is borrowing PHP 23,000 to buy fishing gear and equipment so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children and purchase additional fishing boats. Elsa is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":738789,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase fishing gear and equipment","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Bantayan, Cebu","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":145,"posted_date":"2011-03-25T15:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elsa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":23000,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":920},{"due_date":"2011-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":920},{"due_date":"2011-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":920},{"due_date":"2011-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":920},{"due_date":"2011-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":920},{"due_date":"2011-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":920},{"due_date":"2011-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":920},{"due_date":"2011-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":920},{"due_date":"2011-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":920},{"due_date":"2011-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":920},{"due_date":"2011-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":920},{"due_date":"2011-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":920},{"due_date":"2011-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":920},{"due_date":"2011-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":920},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":920},{"due_date":"2011-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":920},{"due_date":"2011-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":920},{"due_date":"2011-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":920},{"due_date":"2011-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":920},{"due_date":"2011-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":920},{"due_date":"2011-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":920},{"due_date":"2011-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":920},{"due_date":"2011-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":920},{"due_date":"2011-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":920},{"due_date":"2011-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":920}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":154,"local_amount":6440,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:40:09Z","rounded_local_amount":6674.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201332231,"comment":null},{"amount":66,"local_amount":2760,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:34:40Z","rounded_local_amount":2860.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206199905,"comment":null},{"amount":88,"local_amount":3680,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:45:20Z","rounded_local_amount":3813.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211273685,"comment":null},{"amount":110,"local_amount":4600,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:36:28Z","rounded_local_amount":4767.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216553770,"comment":null},{"amount":88,"local_amount":3680,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:16:04Z","rounded_local_amount":3813.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221722431,"comment":null},{"amount":44,"local_amount":1840,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T10:04:08Z","rounded_local_amount":1906.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227092910,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

This time, for her 19th loan, she is borrowing PHP 22,000, which she intends to use as additional capital for her candle-making business so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children and house repairs.

She earns her living by operating a seafood culture business and a dressmaking business. Her husband Danilo, who is 56 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities. They have three children who are between 20 and 34 years old. Felidelfa joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past five loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Felidelfa has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 16,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,600, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her sixth loan, she is borrowing PHP 19,500, to buy fishing gear for her seafood. Felidelfa is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

is a 52-year old married woman who supports her family by operating a general store and a pig-fattening business. She lives in Ilog, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 1998 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 8,000. Arly is borrowing PHP 19,500 to fund her business operations. This will be her 14th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 19,500, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Arly aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

is a 53-year-old married woman who supports her family by operating a fishing business and a fish vending business.  She lives in Bantayan, Cebu. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2002 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her fishing and fish vending businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 8,000. Maura is borrowing PHP 19,500 to purchase fishing gears and equipment. This will be her 14th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 13,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Maura aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Members of this group thank Kiva and its field partner in Kyrgyzstan for assisting underprivileged women who cannot turn to traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAlymkan D., 50, is a leader of this group. All members of this group are residents of a town called Tashkomur in Jalalabad province. She is married and doesn\u2019t have any financial dependents. Alymkan\u2019s husband is a chief engineer in a department of municipal property. \r\n\r\nTen years ago, she herself initiated a business in cattle breeding and reselling. The capital of 10,000 soms came mainly from the money they\u2019ve saved throughout all these years. They like this town because it\u2019s peaceful and always safe to run a business.   \r\n\r\nAlymkan, with help of her husband, takes care of the cattle and goes to a cattle yard once a month to resell them. She makes sure to have affordable prices for people who have even the least capacity to buy. Alymkan spends long hours in the mornings feeding the cattle, taking the cattle for a walk and making veterinarian checks. \r\n\r\nThe income of 10,000 soms is enough to provide Alymkan and her husband with the basic needs. They also want to improve the house\u2019s state. Therefore, Alymkan applied for this loan. She would like to purchase some furniture for the house. \r\n\r\n<b>Where Did This Loan Come From?<\/b>\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused microfinance institution in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple \"P\" bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

is a married woman who lives in Bantayan, Cebu. She earns her living by operating a bakery\/cake-making business and a food vending business. Her husband Eldifonso, who is 39 years old, works as a tricycle driver to earn his living. They have eight children who are between 4 and 16 years old. Analiza joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 18 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Analiza has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 29,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 15,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 19th loan, she is borrowing PHP 29,500 to buy a motorcycle for her bakery so that she can continue to save up for future education of her children and build a new house. Analiza is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

Baktygul started this business when she went to work on the local farm. She managed to cover all her costs and even saved some money to buy electrical appliances for the house. Now the business brings in 4000 soms per month, and Baktygul has decided to try cattle breeding too. She\u2019s quite skillful in it and always has friends who can advise her how to take good care of cattle. She would like to get this loan from Kiva and Mol Bulak Finance in order to purchase some cattle. \r\n\r\n       --- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused microfinance institution in Kyrgyzstan.

This type of loan was exactly what she was recently looking for. Damira thinks it\u2019s a sign from above for her to move forward with the help of Kiva  and believe in a better future.\r\n\r\nDamira O., 56, is the leader of this group. She resides in the town of Toktogul, known for its large water reservoir. Recently, Damira became a widow and now lives all by herself. She is the mother of five grown children who live on their own now. Her youngest, a 19 year-old son works as a fireman in Chychkan Canyon.  He visits her occasionally and helps with taking care of the livestock. It\u2019s been two years since Damira invested 5000 soms in purchasing two livestock animals. Despite her age and heavy physical load in her household, Damira is a very bright and optimistic woman. She looks at the world with a smile and positive thoughts. She is very thankful to her son, who offered his salary as a business start-up capital, because now the number of livestock she owns has grown dramatically. Besides devoting much time to livestock raising, Damira also works as a janitor in a local high school. Everyone who knows Damira just can\u2019t stop admiring her love of life and desire to strive for a better life. These years of hard work has brought enough capital for her to organize a nice wedding ceremony for her son. The purpose of the loan is to purchase more livestock to increase this business.\r\n\r\n --- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers, as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Lucia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 8,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 2,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her fifth loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000, which she intends to use as funds for her business operation so that she can continue to save for the future education of her children. Lucia is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

She believes in her potential to set her life on a new stage and a new path. \r\n\r\nMavluda T., 25, is the leader of this group. She\u2019s a resident of a very small town in the southern Kyrgyzstan, Nookat, with a population of over 13,000 people. She was born and grew up here and wants to spend the rest of her life here because she knows it\u2019s the best place for her children. Mavluda\u2019s husband Dastan is a successful musician and the main breadwinner of the family. \r\n\r\nThey feel blessed to have two daughters of 5 and 3 years old. Last year when the kids were accepted to a daycare, Mavluda needed an occupation to devote her whole daytime. Being a mother has taught her good lessons of choosing the right products for her girls. So she ended up with the idea of selling children\u2019s clothing. She can easily find common language with other mothers who look for the best clothing for their children. The business was started from 1, 000 soms taken from a family\u2019s savings. For now Mavluda receives 7,500 soms of profit every month, most of which she puts back into goods circulation. Mavluda requested a loan from Kiva with intentions of satisfying her consumer needs. In the nearest future the family would like to renew the apartment lease.\r\n\r\n       --- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\n\r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

Zeinegul has been raising cattle for ten years. This idea came from her parents who themselves were successful cattle breeders. The town of Tashkomur is a perfect place for domestic animals. Its high hills, fresh air and the cleanest spring water help Zeinegul raise very healthy livestock animals. Ten years ago she made her first steps in raising livestock by purchasing five goats. Since then the size of her assets has almost tripled. The result speaks for itself \u2013 Zeinegul and her husband bought a truck. Nowadays her husband\u2019s work in the transportation services is a significant source of income for the family. The full income of the family is 15,000 soms a month. Unfortunately, sometimes it is barely enough to provide four kids with their basic needs.

Unfortunately, after seven years of happy marriage, her beloved husband died in car accident. In order to find means of subsistence for her small family, Gulmira started her business in cattle breeding. Using the money she had earned, in 2008 she bought a house in Novonikolaevka village with derelict grape bushes. As Gulmira had always dreamed to be engaged in land cultivating, she decided to revive a beautiful grape garden. Today, her garden consists of more than 200 bushes of grape in 11 different sorts. Such an assortment allows Gulmira to earn about more than 4,500 KGS in a month.  \r\nNow, in order to buy chemicals to manure land and get the system flowing, Gulmira has applied for a loan of 50,000 KGS. With the revenues, she plans to scale up her cultivated land and enlarge the number of grape bushes.

is a farmer.

They had to sell their crop in advance and see reduced earnings. By this time, Safar has gained a lot of experience in his business and now his crop is one of the most in-demand at the market. Safar now faces a small problem because his field is infertile, which makes it difficult to grow his crop. To solve this problem, he has decided to request a loan to buy seeds and fertilizers to support the field and make his crop more productive.   \r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

is a young energetic guy living with his parents. He has greenhouses where he grows wheat, onions and watermelon. Akmal has been in this business for five years. He enjoys working the land and providing people with high quality products. He keeps his greenhouses and household in order. He fixes things himself when something breaks. Akmal's father helps him in his business.\r\n\r\nAkmal would like to borrow 7,500 Tajikistan somoni  to further equip his greenhouses and to buy seed and mineral fertilizer. He hopes to grow more crops this year and increase his family's income. \r\n\r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

He was born in a large family of farmers and from childhood, was the main helper in cattle breeding to his parents. He got married at the age of 20 and moved with his family to Karabalta town. In order to find means of subsistence, Ernist worked as a cleaner at the fuel station and also found underworking jobs. His wife Shakalat helped him by collecting and selling herbs. They had to rent a small jerry building at the outskirts of the town. He made every effort to provide his family with all they needed, but unfortunately, his wage didn\u2019t cover all expenses of their household. For this reason, Ernist decided to move to Altyn village, where he started his business in cattle breeding. Starting with initial capital of 10,000 KGS, he purchased two milk cows, which allow him to earn about 1,500 KGS in a month from selling milk. Now Ernist wants to use this loan of 130,000 KGS to purchase more cows and bull calves for fattening and reselling. In the future, he dreams to develop a huge farm and build a big house for his children and grandchildren. \r\nBai-Tushum and Partners uses Kiva funding to target the especially vulnerable population.

started her own small grocery business about 30 years ago. She operates her store from a building on property she and her husband owns. Khairu has requested a loan of $1,300 USD to make some improvements to her store. She\u2019d like to purchase some shelving material and buy a scale to use for weighing food items. These investments will help Khairu as she continues to develop and expand her business. She hopes to use her profits to pay off her children\u2019s college tuition. In the future, she would also like to do some remodeling to her store so that she can increase her retail space. This is Khairu\u2019s third loan from IMON International. We are happy for another opportunity to assist her in developing a successful business. \r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She lives in Calatrava, Negros Occidental.  She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 1991 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 10,000.  Modesto is borrowing PHP 30,000 to purchase more stock to sell.   This will be her 20th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon.  Her previous loan of PHP 30,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom.  Modesto aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

is a 47-year-old married woman who supports her family by operating two business ventures:  hog raising and a manicure\/pedicure\/weaving business.  She lives in Bantayan, Cebu.  She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2004 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts.  By working hard in her businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 8,000.  Neria is borrowing PHP 29,000 to fund the operations of her businesses. This will be her 15th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 23,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom.  Neria aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

is a 53-year-old married woman who supports her family by operating a food production\/sales business.  She lives in the municipality of Medellin, Cebu. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2008 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her food production\/sales business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 4,000. Nida is borrowing PHP 10,000 to fund the operations of her business. This will be her fifth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon.  Her previous loan of PHP 5,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom.  Nida aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

With the help of her past 14 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Evelyn has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 14,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 9,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 15th loan, she is borrowing PHP 17,000 to buy more stock for her general store so that she can continue to save up for future business expansion and education of her children. Evelyn is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She earns her living by operating two business ventures: dried fish vending and fish and salt vending. Her husband George, who is 38 years old, works as a carpenter\/laborer to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities. They have three children who are 7 to 13 years old and are currently going to school.  Joy joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1997 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 15 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Joy has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 20,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 2,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 16th loan, she is borrowing PHP 25,000 to use as additional capital for fish vending so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Joy is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

He is married with 3 children under his care.  He works as a merchant and in construction where he has been working for 12 years.  His father had fought in the mountains during the war and never came back, leaving him alone with his family, which is why he began working at the age of eight; to help support his family.  He coudl not continue his studies, he only completed the 6th grade.  He learned his trade from a mason who prepared him for the job and trained with him for 2 years as his assistant.  German later spent 10 years as a construction manager with 2 workers to assist him on work sites.  \r\nIn the 1990's he had a loan financed to begin executing his own construction jobs.  After paying off his loan, he received another loan in order to purchase his own land and has also dedicated himself to butchering pigs and farming basic grains. \r\nHe is soliciting this loan to be able to continue working his contruction jobs and purchase materials; and necessary tools to complete jobs, such as the contruction of a chapel in Esteli.  With this loan he hopes his clientele increases by at least 25%.  Within his future plans is the purchase of a vehicle to be able to transport his work tools and workers in order to diminish transportation costs.  His goal is to get his 3 children ahead; he does not want his children to get behind like he did so paying for their education is also a goal.

She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  fishing and fish vending.  Her common-law husband  Necanoro, who is 41 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living.  She has seven children who are 9 months to 14 years old.  Vivian joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family.  With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Vivian has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 7,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 3,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her fifth loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000 to buy fishing gear and equipment so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Vivian is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She earns her living by operating a sari-sari (general) store. Her husband Joel, who is 48 years old, works as a mechanic to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities. They have three children who are 17 to 27 years old.  Jesusa joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2009 because she aspired for something better for her family.  With the help of her past three loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Jesusa has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 20,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 5,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her fourth loan, she is borrowing PHP 29,500 to purchase more stock so that she can save up for the future and the education of her daughter.  Jesusa is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Merylou has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 13,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 13,600, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her fifth loan, she is borrowing PHP 18,000 to buy additional bananas for resale so that she can continue to save up for the future expansion of her business.  Merylou is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

is a married woman who lives in Cadiz City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  pig fattening and buying & selling dried fish. Her husband Deonilo, who is 42 years old, works as a driver to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities. They have three children who are 8 to 20 years old.  Joesela joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family.  With the help of her past 22 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Joesela has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 29,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 5,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 23rd loan, she is borrowing PHP 29,500 to purchase additional piglets so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children.  Joesela is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.
