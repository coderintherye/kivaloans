Larrea lives with his wife and their thirteen-year-old son in Villeta, Paraguay. Together they run a small wooden stand from which they sell fast local-food favorites, such as empanadas, sandwiches, and milanese. They have had this stand for eleven years. A year ago, they began working with the Fundaci\u00f3n Paraguaya, which utilizes programs like Kiva to give mico-financing to small business owners like Pedro and his wife. <p>\r\n\r\nSince their first loan, they have been able to paint their stand. Though otherwise a small achievement, paint is quite expensive, and the loan has allowed them to accomplish this without making sacrifices that would hurt business. In their newly-refurbished stand, they are doing better than ever. However, the couple tells us that they must get up at 3am daily in order to commute into the city and stock their stand. They are forced to shop in the nearby supermarket, though slightly more expensive, because it is the only store open at that hour.  Additionally, all merchandise must be carried to the store for lack of other transportation.<p>\r\n\r\nIn the future, Pedro and his wife would like to buy a van. The van will allow them to transport their goods with greater ease and purchase more at one time. Also, they want to start a delivery route.  As he continues to improve his business and his life, Pedro tells us that his dream is to open a store closer to his home and to earn enough money to ensure the education of his son. It is important to Pedro and his wife that he have the opportunity to become a professional and not have to sacrifice as they do. <p>\r\n\r\nThe money will go toward purchasing flour, eggs, meat, and

Lucy is fifty years old, and when her husband abandoned her, she searched for a way to make a living.  This is how, with much effort, she was able to acquire two sewing machines to start her small sewing shop to make rain ponchos.  She does this work very efficiently with the help of her two younger children.  This hardworking model mother works very hard from 7:00 in the morning until 8:00 at night in the company of her beloved family.  The wish of Lucy and her family is to have more fabric to make their waterproof ponchos and to distribute them on a wholesale basis to the different markets in the city.  During this rainy season, the markets are demanding a large number of these garments.

Ten years ago she started working in a meals business that she created together with her family. However, when her daughters started growing up they did not want to help Magdalena with the business anymore. Rather, they started doing other jobs and she was left working together with her husband. When Magdalena's husband passed away two years ago and Magdalena fell into a terrible depression, the tasks of the meal preparation business became harder for her, and so she decided to stop selling meals. Instead, she started selling clothes in a <i>tianguis<\/i> (small itinerant outdoor market), because she believes this business is not as draining on her and also clothes sell as well as the meals.<p>\r\nHowever, all the income she obtains from this business only covers her living expenses and because of this in some occasions she does not have much money to invest in new clothes to sell. For this reason she is requesting a loan for US $ 475 which she is willing to pay in a period of 6 months. With this money she will be able to buy more merchandise for the winter season to offer greater variety to her clients.

She works together with her neighbor who sells fast food.  People who come to buy the food also like to buy a cold drink, and they have a strong customer base with the university students who come to their stands every day around lunch. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p> Clarisa has been doing this work for 35 years, starting with only 71 dollars, which were her savings from working as a housecleaner before she started her business.   Her business started out from a little wooden stand covered in plastic, many years ago when they were building the central market of Leon.  Her husband, who worked on a farm with dairy cows, selling the milk very early in the morning to local clients, and later selling cold drinks in the market, helps her in the business.    He continues to sell milk, but now his main business is selling juices and breakfasts to people before work. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>They have invested their loans in their business.  With this work they support their family.  Their 4 children attend school.    They've used the loans for 2 1\/2 years,  and are at the point now where their business is strong and can survive thanks to the money they were loaned.  Their business is growing every day, and it's had a great impact on their economic well being.

Se ayuda con su vecina que vende comida r\u00e1pida, por lo tanto quienes llegan a comprar comida a la vez compran el refresco y podemos decir que tiene muchos clientes fijos entre ellos universitarios que visitan el puesto todos los dias a la hora del almuerzo.\r\n<p>\r\nTiene 35 a\u00f1os de trabajar en este negocio y comenz\u00f3 con un capital de 71 d\u00f3lares, estos eran sus ahorros de los servicios dom\u00e9sticos que hac\u00eda antes de encargarse a vender refrescos...trabajaba de empleada dom\u00e9stica.<p>\r\nSu negocio inici\u00f3  debajo de cuatro estacas de madera cubiertas de pl\u00e1stico negro, esto fue hace muchos a\u00f1os cuando construyeron el mercado Central de Le\u00f3n. Con la ayuda de su esposo que trabajaba en una finca orde\u00f1ando vacas y vendiendo leche a las 5 de la ma\u00f1ana a clientes fijos, luego se iba al mercado a vender frescos, cuando en ese tiempo un vaso de jugo natural tenia un costo de 0.50 centavos de c\u00f3rdobas la unnidad. Luego remodelaron el mercado y fu\u00e9 ubicada en el actual tramo donde desarrolla esta actividad. A la vez ellos siguen vendiendo leche pero ahora su principal negocio es vender jugos y desayuno preparado para quienes deseen alimentarse antes de trabajar.\r\n<p>\r\nSus cr\u00e9ditos los invierte exactamente en su negocio de frescos.

That's why since she was 30 years old, she has been selling clothing.  Years ago, she had a small stand, but she could not make enough to cover the rent.  Because of the difficult situation facing her family, she decided to sell her garments door to door and in markets.   Little by little, she began to sell her items at the local fairs.   Now things are picking up and she would like to establish herself in a commercial location so her knitted pieces, designed entirely by her, will be better displayed and appreciated.

She began to create her handmade pieces back when she was in 6th grade, learning from her mother and selling her own pieces in order to help the family's financial situation.   She used the money from her mother to buy merchandise and sold her pieces from the time she was young.   Her mother worked as a seamstress from their house, creating all kinds of clothing and uniforms. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p> Later, her mother helped her set up a shop and turned the business over to Olga, who has done well with it, always participating in the social gatherings and national fairs to display her products.  Olga is married and she and her husband support their children.  She has had 7 loans which have helped her improve their quality of life.

graduating from school Shoira A. got married. Her husband used to work seasonally (he helped his uncle to grow grapes). After the birth of their 4th child, Shoira had to begin trading at the market while her oldest daughter took care of the children. Initially, Shoira purchased goods from wholesale traders, but the prices were very high when she had to take out loans. In the summer of 2006, she found out about a credit program called \"Microinvest\". After receiving her first loan, she was able to secure lower prices for the goods she purchased wholesale, which allowed her to gain additional income. One part of the income was spent on family needs and the remaining part Shoira invested in her business. In order to be more competitive in her business, she plans to travel to Bishkek (Kyrgyz Republic) to purchase goods. This way, she will expand to a wholesale business. \r\n<p> <b>Translated from Russian by Anna Startseva, Kiva Volunteer.<b><p>\r\n\r\n\u0410\u044e\u0431\u0447\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430

Obidovna has been selling children's clothing for the past 7 years. She is married and has 3 children. Her husband is a member of a civilian company. He is receiving a very small pension. After the birth of their youngest child Mutabar had to start selling on the market leaving her children under the care of her oldest daughter. In the beginning, she was buying goods wholesale in credit, but the cost was much higher than buying them retail. In 2006 Mutabar first found out about  MicroInvest credit lending. She then took out a loan and was able to buy goods wholesale for lower prices which allowed her to make some profit. She was spending part of her income on the needs of her family and reinvested the rest in her business. To be more competitive, Mutabar intends to travel to Bishkek, the Republic of Kyrgyzstan, which will allow her to start selling wholesale. \r\n<p> <b>Translated from Russian by Elena Fedorchuk, Kiva

the Soviet Union collapsed and the factory where she worked became bankrupt, Roziya Sulaimonovna I. had to begin trading. She started in 1992 by selling children's clothing. Currently, she has a trading location on the central clothes market. When she travels for goods to Karasu (Kyrgyz Republic) her daughter replaces her at the market. Her business is the main source of income for the family. After her son's marriage in the summer of this year, her capital base has decreased, and now she is looking to raise back the capital base and is therefore asking for financial support. \r\n<p>

B., 22, is married. He owns a photo studio that provides a variety of services to the residents of Kurgan-Tube. At present, to print his photo orders, Suhrob must travel to Dushanbe located 80 km from Kurgan-Tube. Suhrob plans to use this loan to purchase photo processing equipment. Having all the needed equipment at his studio, Suhrob will be able to reduce photo processing time and expenses and pass on the savings to the residents of Kurgan-Tube. Suhrob also hopes that by offering better service, he will be able to acquire new clients.

They live in their own house, with the basic necessities.  They have 3  children, two sons and one girl, all teenagers who study at the public school.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p> Alba has been the owner of a small general store for more than 5 years.  She sells items for every day use such as rice, oil, drinks, flour, etc.   She runs her business from her home, and her children help her.   Her husband has worked for the railroads for more than 20 years and has a monthly salary which helps cover the costs of taking care of and educating the children. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p> The motivation for requesting a loan is to be able to purchase more merchandise to stock the business, such as ciders, wines, beer, soft drinks, etc.  because the demand for these items is always high at the end of the year.  One of the projects Alba has for next year is to open another business, selling clothing, items for the home, office, gifts, etc.   There is currently no such shop in the neighborhood and her customers are requesting it. <\/p>\r\n\r\nDescripci\u00f3n:\tDESCRIPCION necesidad \r\n\r\nLa se\u00f1ora Alba M. de 35 a\u00f1os de edad, esta casada con el se\u00f1or Valent\u00edn C\u00e1ceres de 41 a\u00f1os, viven en casa propia, equipada con las necesidades b\u00e1sicas del hogar. Tienen tres hijos a\u00fan menores de edad, dos son varones y una mujer; todos ellos son adolescentes y est\u00e1n estudiando en colegios p\u00fablicos.<p>\r\n\r\nLa se\u00f1ora Alba es propietaria de una despensa con m\u00e1s de 5 a\u00f1os de antig\u00fcedad, vende art\u00edculos de primera necesidad como ser arroz, aceite, bebidas en general, harina, etc., su  negocio lo tiene en su propia casa, que es atendida por ella y por sus hijos. Su marido trabaja como empleado ferroviario hace m\u00e1s de 20 a\u00f1os y tiene un salario mensual, con la que ayuda a cubrir los gastos de alimentaci\u00f3n y la educaci\u00f3n de sus tres hijos. <p>\r\n\r\nEl motivo por el cual solicitan el cr\u00e9dito es para la compra de mercader\u00edas en oferta como ser: vinos, sidras, cervezas, golosinas, productos enlatados, etc. ya que en \u00e9pocas de fin de a\u00f1o la demanda de estos art\u00edculos es bastante alta. <p>\r\n\r\nUno de los proyectos de Alba para el pr\u00f3ximo a\u00f1o es la de abrir otro negocio, esta ser\u00e1 en el ramo de mercer\u00eda y bazar (venta de art\u00edculos varios como ropa, art\u00edculos para la casa, librer\u00eda, regalos, etc.). ya que   en el barrio no existe ning\u00fan comercio dedicado a esos rubros

find Casilda eagerly tending to her small store, which she has also outfitted in part to bring internet services to her community.  She began her work two years ago, with the support and encouragement of her three adolescent children.  She projects the same love and enthusiasm she shows to her business activities to her work as a teacher, a job which fills her with happiness and satisfaction as it allows her to guide and share her knowledge with her students.  She is the sole means of income for her family, and for this reason she works tirelessly with one objective: to provide a first-rate education for her children who, thanks to the good example she has given them, fill her with great pride.  The wish of this exemplary mother is to upgrade her equipment and to expand her business location to be able to offer her customers better services and a more comfortable environment.  To reach her goals, she asks for a loan and promises to repay such over a period of eight months.  Let\u2019s help Casilda continue her noble aim of seeking to improve her life and those of her children.\r\n\r\n<p><b> Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn, Kiva Volunteer. <\/b><p>   \r\n\r\nEncontramos a Dora Casilda  atendiendo afanosamente  su peque\u00f1a bodeguita, lugar  en el que tambi\u00e9n habilit\u00f3  un espacio para brindar servicios de internet a su comunidad, trabajo que emprendi\u00f3  hace  dos a\u00f1os  con apoyo  e iniciativa de sus tres hijos adolescentes.El mismo amor y af\u00e1n con el que se desempe\u00f1a en sus actividades econ\u00f3micas, tambi\u00e9n lo demuestra cuando se desenvuelve   como profesora  en un centro educativo  del medio rural, este   trabajo  la  llena de alegr\u00eda y mucha  satisfacci\u00f3n   porque le permite guiar y transmitir sus conocimientos a sus queridos alumnos.

This type of selling strategy is called \u201chawking.\u201d It is common in Ghana, but normally for lighter-weight items. A lot of hawkers complain of neck and head pains from hawking, but Elizabeth, at the age of 55, says the only challenge that she has encountered is not having enough profit to expand her business.\r\n<p>\r\nMuch of Elizabeth\u2019s profits went to her children\u2019s education fees, but now 2 have completed school, so she is able to focus more on her business.

With the profits that she will be making, she plans to pay for the education of her youngest child and to finish building a house for her family.\r\n<p>\r\nElizabeth is a member of the Bisa Ewurade group.

Ya con la pr\u00e1ctica ha mejorado y tiene mayor velocidad al tejer sus prendas  y es as\u00ed que produce con sus bellos tejidos a crochet chalinas, ropones para beb\u00e9s y fustanes de lana.Este talento que  posee le ha permitido superar los tiempos de crisis econ\u00f3mica que su familia ha sufrido en muchas ocasiones  en que los  ingresos econ\u00f3micos han sido insuficientes para cubrir los gastos de manutenci\u00f3n de sus cuatro hijos que est\u00e1n en edad escolar.  Su esposo es un humilde alba\u00f1il y muchas veces los trabajos son  temporales es por ello que tambi\u00e9n , Juana, en ocasiones vende canchita en bolsa en las puertas de algunas escuelas y tambi\u00e9n los cines de su ciudad.Tiene planes de  construir  una peque\u00f1a granja de pollos que por el momento s\u00f3lo mantiene en casa para consumo familiar. Todos estos deseos espera cumplirlos con perseverancia y ayuda del talento que posee y solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para invertirlos en la  compra de lana y de una cantidad considerable de gallinas para la granja que desea implementar en casa.Juana agradece tu noble deseo  de apoyarla.\r\n\r\n<p> Translated by Kiva volunteer, Emily Charnes <\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":86364,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","use":"TO PURCHASE WOOL FOR THE GARMENTS SHE KNITS AND SELLS, AS WELL MATERIALS FOR A CHICKEN THEY WANT TO BUILD BEHIND THEIR SMALL HOUSE","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2007-11-24T19:55:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-12-08T21:02:16Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2008-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2008-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2008-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2008-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2008-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2008-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2008-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2008-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":133.36}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":47.22},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":47.22},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":47.22},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":47.22},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":47.22},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":47.22},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":47.22},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":47.22},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":47.24}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":48,"local_amount":135.53,"processed_date":"2008-01-08T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:41:53Z","rounded_local_amount":143.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":112030,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":48,"local_amount":135.53,"processed_date":"2008-02-08T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:41:54Z","rounded_local_amount":143.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":131355,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":48,"local_amount":135.53,"processed_date":"2008-03-08T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:41:59Z","rounded_local_amount":143.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":153084,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":48,"local_amount":135.53,"processed_date":"2008-04-08T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:42:14Z","rounded_local_amount":143.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177195,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":48,"local_amount":135.53,"processed_date":"2008-05-08T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:43:00Z","rounded_local_amount":143.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":204612,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":48,"local_amount":135.53,"processed_date":"2008-06-08T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:44:41Z","rounded_local_amount":143.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":231914,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":48,"local_amount":135.53,"processed_date":"2008-07-08T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:48:28Z","rounded_local_amount":143.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":261012,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":48,"local_amount":135.53,"processed_date":"2008-08-08T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:56:38Z","rounded_local_amount":143.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":289910,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":41,"local_amount":115.76,"processed_date":"2008-09-08T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-09T02:15:45Z","rounded_local_amount":122.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":320260,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2007-11-24T21:02:16Z","paid_date":"2008-09-09T02:15:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":24803,"name":"Alusine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alusine started his business 10 years ago during the war.

She began her business thanks to the first loan she received, equal to about $36.  Starting with a small stand outside the Terminal market in the city of Leon.  She lacks a good infrastructure in her business and part of the loan she is requesting is to make needed repairs to keep out the rain. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p> She takes care of 4 children and is a single mother.  Life has been hard for Zenayda, but with perseverance and love for her children, she has managed to improve the quality of their lives, working hard to make sure the house had food and her children could go to school.   She has received ten short term loans which have helped her a lot, growing her profits and allowing her to invest more in the business, ensuring her customers of the quality of the products she offers. <\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Zenayda ha trabajado desde hace 7 a\u00f1os vendiendo productos lacteos como Cuajada, crema, leche, y esto lo compra directamente a los peque\u00f1os productores que viajan del campo a la ciudad a vender este producto. Recuerda que el negocio lo comenz\u00f3 gracias a un primer pr\u00e9stamo que hizo por la cantidad de 700 c\u00f3rdobas ( equivalente a 36 d\u00f3lares). Empez\u00f3 en un puesto fijo al aire libre fuera del mercado La Terminal en la ciudad de Le\u00f3n.

In spite of the difficulties she has faced, she has a strong will, inspired by her two children, to improve the  quality of life for her family.   Now, because her husband is very ill and unable to get out of bed,  Ivonne has found herself responsible for maintaining the house and the family.   She needed to put into practice something she learned from her family and friends, embroidery of handicrafts which she sells from her home.  Even though it's very hard, she manages the hours needed for her work and her family.  She feels satisfied that she can maintain the family.  Her goal is to expand her shop and buy the materials needed to make her crafts.  She is requesting a loan for this and needs your kind support to help her reach her goals.  <\/p>\r\n\r\nIvonne, es una mujer multifac\u00e9tica y emprendedora, estas  cualidades son merecidas en su personalidad porque ella tiene ese gran \u00edmpetu e iniciativa para trabajar y desempe\u00f1arse plenamente en lo que le encomienden. A pesar de las circunstancias dif\u00edciles que le ha tocado vivir  tiene una inmensa  fortaleza inspirada en sus dos hijos  para sacar a flote a su familia, ahora a\u00fan m\u00e1s debido a que su esposo se encuentra delicado de salud y la enfermedad se ha tornado grave ya que no puede liberarse de su postraci\u00f3n de una humilde cama.Por estas circunstancias apremiantes Ivonne ha asumido la direcci\u00f3n de su hogar y  la manutenci\u00f3n es directamente su responsabilidad. Esta necesidad ha hecho que ponga en pr\u00e1ctica lo que una vez  aprendi\u00f3 de sus familiares y amigos; el bordado de fustanes, la elaboraci\u00f3n de artesan\u00edas llamadas mates burilados y la atenci\u00f3n personalizada a las solicitudes de sus clientes en su peque\u00f1a tienda ubicada en casa.  El tiempo muchas veces suele ser corto para, Ivonne, pero no la desanima pues ahora se ha adecuado para distribuir las horas del d\u00eda en la atenci\u00f3n de su familia y el de sus negocios. A pesar de la penosa situaci\u00f3n por la que atraviesa su familia ella se siente satisfecha de poder sostener a su familia aunque con mucho esfuerzo; su inmenso deseo es  implementar su tiendita y comprar para las dem\u00e1s actividades que realiza las materias primas necesarias para continuar con la elaboraci\u00f3n del resto de sus productos y por esta raz\u00f3n solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para cumplir con lo que se ha propuesto. Recuerda que Ivonne necesita tu desinteresado apoyo para ver sonre\u00edr pronto a su familia otra vez."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":86420,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"TO BETTER STOCK HER SMALL SHOP AND BUY MATERIALS NEEDED TO CONTINUE MAKING HER HANDICRAFTS.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2007-11-25T01:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ivonne Nilda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-12-09T03:29:13Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":222.22},{"due_date":"2008-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":222.22},{"due_date":"2008-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":222.22},{"due_date":"2008-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":222.22},{"due_date":"2008-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":222.22},{"due_date":"2008-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":222.22},{"due_date":"2008-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":222.22},{"due_date":"2008-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":222.22},{"due_date":"2008-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":222.24}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":222.22,"processed_date":"2008-01-09T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:41:53Z","rounded_local_amount":224.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":112810,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":75,"local_amount":222.22,"processed_date":"2008-02-09T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:41:54Z","rounded_local_amount":224.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":132160,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":75,"local_amount":222.22,"processed_date":"2008-03-09T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:41:59Z","rounded_local_amount":224.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":153963,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":75,"local_amount":222.22,"processed_date":"2008-04-09T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:42:15Z","rounded_local_amount":224.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":178157,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":75,"local_amount":222.22,"processed_date":"2008-05-09T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:43:01Z","rounded_local_amount":224.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":205566,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":75,"local_amount":222.22,"processed_date":"2008-06-09T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:44:42Z","rounded_local_amount":224.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":233003,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":75,"local_amount":222.22,"processed_date":"2008-07-09T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:48:33Z","rounded_local_amount":224.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":262049,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":75,"local_amount":222.22,"processed_date":"2008-08-09T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:56:47Z","rounded_local_amount":224.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":290977,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":75,"local_amount":222.22,"processed_date":"2008-09-09T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-11T07:28:09Z","rounded_local_amount":224.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":321376,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2007-11-25T03:29:13Z","paid_date":"2008-09-11T07:28:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":24829,"name":"Esther","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Esther is the happiest client that we interviewed.

Rocio is a hardworking woman who grew up in a family whose business was making furniture such as beds as well as manufacturing mattresses.  During her years growing up, Rocio dedicated a lot of time to learning about the sales of furniture and that's why five years ago she decided to start selling the furniture produced in her parents factory on her own.   Now, with the experience she has gained, she would like to set up her own furniture shop.  Every week she produces pieces to sell, trying to build a better future for her own family.  It's hard work, but she produces pieces made with metal which are beautiful and high quality.   She would like to grow this business and is requesting a loan to buy the paints and metals needed to produce her furniture.  Your help is very important in helping her reach her goals.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\nRoc\u00edo, es una mujer valerosa  con gran disposici\u00f3n para el trabajo, ella creci\u00f3 en una familia que se dedica  a la fabricaci\u00f3n de muebles de metal entre ellas camas y camarotes (camas de dos pisos), tambi\u00e9n confeccionaban colchones. Durante todos estos a\u00f1os Roc\u00edo aprendi\u00f3 y se dedic\u00f3 durante mucho tiempo a la venta de muebles y es as\u00ed como hace cinco a\u00f1os se anim\u00f3 a vender lo que producen en la f\u00e1brica de su padre de manera independiente.Hoy con el paso de los a\u00f1os y con la experiencia adquirida piensa implementar su propio taller de fabricaci\u00f3n de muebles debido a que el conocimiento y buen manejo de recursos le provienen de familia. Por ahora d\u00eda a d\u00eda  sale  todos los domingos a comercializar  lo que produjo durante los 6 d\u00edas anteriores en b\u00fasqueda de un futuro mejor para sus dos hijos que la motivan y fortalecen para superar situaciones de escasez econ\u00f3mica.

Slowly, his business has been growing.  He's increasing his income and profits and feels grateful to the help from CEPRODEL, who has been by his side supporting his efforts for three years.

is a brave lady who works each and every day to support her four children.  They drive her life and energize her to continue moving forward, despite having suffered the abandonment of her husband a year ago.  This episode was a very painful chapter in her life, but it did not destroy her.  She always worked in food sales, and her strength has become an example to many people.  She has decided to continue in her endeavors to support her children, particularly the needs of her seven year old who has been greatly impacted by the abandonment of her father.  For Estela, the days of highest sales volume are Sundays which have the greatest flow of customers.  She sells her foods by traveling around the local areas and her sales are steady given how well-received her dishes are by her clientele.  This, and the help of her beloved children, has motivated her to continue and succeed over her recent crisis.  She has plans to improve her business, and to reach this objective asks for a loan.  The investment and any profits thereof are to help pay for the educational costs of her children.  A brave and strong heart cannot be left unsupported.

Their marriage has given Delma and her husband three children, who they have worked to help progress. Two of the children are of school age, and the oldest helps out in the business.<p>\r\n\r\nApproximatly four years ago Delma had to leave behind her life of working only as a housewife, and open a business in the Isreal Lewites market in the city of Managua. It was not easy for her in the beginning, as she hadn't yet learned to deal in plastics. Nevertheless, she took the risk for the well being of her family. She began with $800 in capital. Her location is not very well placed, as she must take her products out to display them.<p>\r\n\r\nShe came up with the idea of opening her business as the need arose to pay bills and to pay for things that her husband's small salary didn't cover. Currently, Delma sells about $80.00 in product per day. Thanks to CEPRODEL, she has been able to improve the infrastructure of her location, and purchase more merchandise. She has been working with CEPRODEL for 2 years, and has a history of 9 loans.<p>\r\n <p><b>Translated from Spanish by James Comstock, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nDelma Eugenia es propietaria de su negocio, ama de casa, madre incondicional y esposa dedicada.

El inicio de su negocio no fue facil pues como todo comienzo ella no manejaba muy bien el asunto de los pl\u00e1sticos, sin embargo aun as\u00ed se arriesgo por el bienestar de su familia.Comenz\u00f3 con un capital de U$800.00. Su local no esta muy bien ubicado ya que para exhibir su producto tiene que sacarlo.<p>\r\n\r\nLa idea de poner su negocio surge debido a la necesidad de sufragar gastos y cubrir necesidades que el salario devengado por su esposo no cubr\u00eda. Hoy en d\u00eda Delma vende aproximadamente U$80.00 diarios, gracias a CEPRODEL ha podido ampliar la infraestructura de su local y comprar m\u00e1s mercader\u00eda.

a lot going on in this picture. In front is Regina with one of her daughters. She has a restaurant in Kyebando on the outskirts of Kampala. The banana leaves in the pot are simmering matooke, unripe bananas, which is the largest staple in the villager\u2019s diet. To make matooke, get a big pot, put a little water in the bottom, buy a clump of green bananas still on the stem with maybe 100 bananas on the stalk. Everything gets used, so cut the stalk in slices and place in the bottom of the pot and cover with banana leaves. Now peel those green bananas and place them on top of the leaves and cover with more leaves, so that the heat doesn\u2019t escape. Losing heat means wasting charcoal which costs money. Let it simmer for 3-4 hours, remove, mash and presto: matooke!\r\n\r\nBehind Regina is her restaurant where the cooking is always done outside. After all that\u2019s where the hubbub is and the cooking is done with charcoal. The restaurant is simple: benches, no tables, no cutlery, people eat with their hands. Behind Regina are a lot of people. When a reporting agent goes into the field, a crowd follows. It makes for great fun as the children always call our mazungu, meaning white person. This is a kind recognition and all smile and laugh.\r\n\r\nRegina is 30 years old, single with three children and one dependent.

He is married with one child and resides in the town of Mlolongo along the Nairobi-Mombasa Highway.  Apart from his family, Mutinda also assists his elderly father by paying school fees for his twin brothers, who are 16 years old and in secondary school.  He has also taken in his 10 year old nephew after his sister - his nephew's mother - passed away in the year 2000.\r\n\r\nAfter finishing his secondary school education in the year 1994, and not being able to find employment, Mutinda decided to engage into brick making.  Since this work did not require any capital to begin, all he needed to do was learn the skills of brick making.  After learning the basic skills, Mutinda made 5,000 pieces of bricks, which he sold for Ksh 5 per piece.  He earned a total of Ksh 25,000 (USD $368).  From this, he gave his wife Ksh 5,000 for household use, and the rest he saved.  He then made another 5,000 pieces of bricks, which again he sold for Ksh 25,000.  He saved all of this, totaling savings of Ksh 45,000 (USD $662).  With this as his initial capital, Mutinda bought an assortment of goods like spoons, shoes, pencils, books, small transistor radios, shoe polish, plastic plates, sufurias, etc.  He was using a bicycle to sell his wares.\r\n\r\nThen, in the year 1996, Mutinda rented a stall in the town of Kitengela, on the outskirts of Nairobi.  The business was doing well, but due to stiff competition from neighbors, he opted to leave Kitengela and decided to try his luck in a neighboring, upcoming town by the name of Mlolongo.  Luck was on his side and he rented a stall, expanding his business by adding TVs, DVDs, and radios.  The business is doing well and Mutinda is still operating from this stall.\r\n\r\nDue to the increasing population in Mlolongo, Mutinda wants to add to his inventory so that he can meet the demands of his customers.  He approached one leading micro-finance bank for a loan, but due to the high interest he opted not to take the loan.  Since then, he heard about Action Now Kenya partnering with Kiva, and also saw some of the clients who have benefited from Kiva loans.  Their businesses are flourishing, so Mutinda decided to come to Action Now Kenya to try his luck.\r\n Mutinda, therefore, requests a loan of $1,175.  With this loan, Mutinda will be able to purchase TVs, radios, dvds, vcd players, vcd discs, and cassettes.  This will greatly improve his business, translating into more income.  Mutinda plans to employ a helper to assist him in the day-to-day operations of the business, and intends to repay the loan within 10 months."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":86710,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Electronics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase 6 Television sets, 5 Radios, 4 DVD\/VCD Players, installation wires and bulbs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Mlolongo settlement","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":36,"posted_date":"2007-11-22T19:15:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Phythias","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-12-07T21:43:42Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":75000,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":7500},{"due_date":"2008-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":7500},{"due_date":"2008-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":7500},{"due_date":"2008-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":7500},{"due_date":"2008-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":7500},{"due_date":"2008-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":7500},{"due_date":"2008-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":7500},{"due_date":"2008-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":7500},{"due_date":"2008-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":7500},{"due_date":"2008-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":7500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":117.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":118,"local_amount":7531.91,"processed_date":"2008-01-07T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:32:42Z","rounded_local_amount":7634.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":111070,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":118,"local_amount":7531.91,"processed_date":"2008-02-07T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:33:02Z","rounded_local_amount":7634.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":130319,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":118,"local_amount":7531.91,"processed_date":"2008-03-07T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:33:17Z","rounded_local_amount":7634.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151977,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":118,"local_amount":7531.91,"processed_date":"2008-04-07T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:34:00Z","rounded_local_amount":7634.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":176078,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":118,"local_amount":7531.91,"processed_date":"2008-05-07T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:34:41Z","rounded_local_amount":7634.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":203379,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":118,"local_amount":7531.91,"processed_date":"2008-06-07T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:35:09Z","rounded_local_amount":7634.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":230615,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":118,"local_amount":7531.91,"processed_date":"2008-07-07T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:35:33Z","rounded_local_amount":7634.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":259728,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":118,"local_amount":7531.91,"processed_date":"2008-08-07T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:36:16Z","rounded_local_amount":7634.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":288532,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":118,"local_amount":7531.91,"processed_date":"2008-09-07T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-09T01:36:16Z","rounded_local_amount":7634.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":318826,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":113,"local_amount":7212.77,"processed_date":"2008-10-07T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-08T07:04:06Z","rounded_local_amount":7310.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":350725,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2007-11-23T21:43:42Z","paid_date":"2008-10-08T07:04:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":4,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":24988,"name":"Walter","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Walter is 30 years old and lives with his 26 year old wife Delia Delgado in their own home.

She lives in Kayole - an outer district of Nairobi.  Apart from her child, Angelina also takes care of her four siblings who are orphans.  After their mother died in 2003, their father remarried and he no longer gives them any form of assistance.  \r\n\r\nAngelina has been a shop-keeper for the last three months now.  She started the business with a capital of $88, which she received from a merry-go-round, and she also added another $44 from her own savings.  She rented a room in the Kayole area for which she paid $29 in rent, and then bought items in small quantities, such as a half bundle of maize flour, a half sack of sugar, a sack of rice, a half carton of cooking oil, and many more to sell.  This purchasing method went on for two weeks, and then Angelina started buying items in large quantities.  She also buys and sells items according to her customers\u2019 demands.  \r\n\r\nPreviously, Angelina also had a business selling second-hand clothes, which was very seasonal, so there were times when she had no money.  Angelina decided that she couldn\u2019t continue with this business and that is how she decided to open a general shop.  Angelina\u2019s business ideas were inherited from her family, which is business oriented.  Her father also used to own shops and boutiques where Angelina helped in managing.  Therefore, operating businesses isn\u2019t something new to her.

Nowadays their small workshop has been satisfying because it is giving them the chance to generate a good income at the same time and it allows them to offer job opportunities to another three people of their community, who feel very content fulfilling their job.

Maria Elsa's sister-in-law helped her get started and she's been working at the business for 12 years now.
