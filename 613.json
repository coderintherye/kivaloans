They live mostly in polygamous families in KOULOUWO, one of the villages in the municipality of KABOILA in the prefecture of SIKASSO, the third largest administrative region of Mali.\r\n\r\nThey work with the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso to develop their farming business during the rainy season.  They are on their fourth loan with the institution. Their prior loans have been fully repaid.  The crops are: tomatoes and jakatou (a vegetable that resembles a small green tomato but is actually a member of the eggplant family) by FATOUMATA the first person standing on the right of the photo.  With her loan, she plans to pay labor costs and buy inputs and agricultural seeds for maintaining 1.5 hectares. The output is sold at the village level, at the Fachoribougou village and at the SIKASSO market, after the harvest, to customers consisting of men and women.  She plans to earn an average profit of 95,500 FCFA per year. This profit will allow her to repay her loan and also to help her husband with the daily expenditures.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, Western culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only seven percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients have viable business propositions. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

is 35 years old and lives with her husband and two daughters, ages 10 and 12 in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. Her family lives in a small house in the outer ger (traditional Mongolian housing tent) districts. \r\nShe sells clothes at Narantuul, the largest outdoor market in Mongolia. Her husband works as a plumber at a local company. \r\nUsually, it is very difficult to obtain a rental contract at Narantuul because the stalls are in such high demand. When Delgermurun first began her business in 2003, she rented a stall at Narantuul from another person who had a rental contract with Narantuul. This was an unstable business situation for her because the middleman could dismiss her at any time.\r\nIn 2005, however, Delgermurun had the opportunity to sign a rental contract directly with Narantuul in order to make her business more stable. Now her working capital is 3,300,000 Mongolian Tugriks (MNT), and she sells clothes at her own two stalls.\r\nFor the past 8 years, Delgermurun and her husband have been successfully improving their living conditions gradually. For example, they built their own small house in 2010 and then they bought a used car with 8,000,000 MN of their business earnings in January, 2011. So, Delgermurun\u2019s working capital decreased.\r\n\r\nWith this loan of 2,500,000 MNT, Delgermurun will purchase more clothes from Ereen City, China. Delgermurun wants to use this loan to help support her in this very busy shopping season of the year.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":856.51,"image":{"id":791668,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n \r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n \r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It is sold to local dairy product retailers. They also have nut trees and sell 180-200 kg nuts per season. Two hectares of family-owned land are used for maize growing, where in total eight tons of maize is harvested. Half of the harvested maize is sold to local retailers and the rest is used in the dairy farm. On another two hectares of land the family grows four tons of musk-melon and 20 tons of watermelons. The total average monthly income of the family is 400 Laris. \r\n\r\nWith the requested loan Amiran plans to purchase fertilizers for the melon garden.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is a single mother of an 8 year old son who is in the third grade. The first loan that she got from FINCA Peru was used to increase her capital. She will also use this loan to increase her capital and to begin planting potatoes. \r\n\r\nJulia studied chemical engineering and saw a need in the field of agrochemistry, so she decided to open up her own business when her son was born. Since she started working with FINCA Peru she's been able to work and take care of her son at the same time, because her business was based in her home. Now that her son is older she will be able to have someone else take care of the business at home so that she can leave to work. \r\n\r\nWhat she likes most about FINCA Peru are her friends, the meetings and the distraction from her daily life. She also likes the fact that FINCA Peru has helped her to save, and thanks to those savings she will be able to buy a car.

With this loan, she will buy a larger cart.  She needs to renovate the infrastructure of her business, and this cart will give her more space.  Ximena is making this investment with her husband because he plans to use it to move his merchandise.  He works at the open market selling other types of products.  This new cart will allow her to obtain a permit so that she can sell her products without difficulty.  \r\n<p>\r\nXimena lives with her husband and two daughters.

She works on her fields with the help of day laborers, who remove the weeds, harvest, and transport the products to the roads, where they are then transported in tricycles and wheelbarrows.  What she enjoys most about her work is the liberty that she has in the management of her fields, since she gets to decide what is best for her cultivations.  She has been doing this for over 5 years and considers the most difficult part to combating the insects that eat her plants.  But for now, her priority is to purchase new land in order to increase her cultivations.  This is her second credit with MFP and she is aware that this money will be very useful in the progress of her work.

Th\u1eafm is the group leader of a two-member group receiving a loan offered by SEDA. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is \u0110\u00f4ng Mai - Nh\u00f3m 02 (2).\r\n\r\nTh\u1eafm is married and has three adult children. To make a living, Th\u1eafm owns a manufacturing business, manufacturing and selling wood products to local businesses and community members. Th\u1eafm has been engaged in this business for over three years and earns approximately 2,500,000 Vietnamese dong (VND) a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Th\u1eafm joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Th\u1eafm has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,152,000 VND from SEDA. This previous loan was used to purchase raw materials to manufacture additional products. She is now requesting a new loan of 7,392,000 VND, which will be used to purchase additional raw materials to expand product offerings to include beds and wardrobes. This will be Th\u1eafm's second loan from SEDA. Th\u1eafm plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the Other Borrowers in the Group:\r\n\r\n1.

Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n\r\nTh\u1eafm l\u00e0 46 tu\u1ed5i n\u1eef.
