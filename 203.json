unusual profession for this modern age, he makes traditional chests.  This trade was passed on to him from his father, and together they continue it.  A Tajik chest is traditionally given to one's daughter when she marries, therefore the chests are continually in high demand.  Wood that has dried for three years is needed for construction of a chest, special tin for decoration and they are painted with paints made from natural dyes.  Abdugufron's chests are strong and beautiful and sell quickly. He is currently out of materials, and therefore to increase their supply, he is applying for a loan. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Joyce ., Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1575,"image":{"id":302205,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture Making","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"Purchase of materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Isfara","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.116667 70.633333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":"2009-04-12T17:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abdugufron","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":6000,"loan_amount":1575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":670.76},{"due_date":"2009-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":692},{"due_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":713.91},{"due_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":736.52},{"due_date":"2009-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":759.84},{"due_date":"2009-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":783.91},{"due_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":808.73},{"due_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":834.33}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":176.07},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181.65},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":187.4},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":193.34},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":199.46},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":205.78},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":212.29},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":219.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":176.07,"local_amount":670.76,"processed_date":"2009-05-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:13:02Z","rounded_local_amount":675.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44599896,"comment":null},{"amount":181.65,"local_amount":692,"processed_date":"2009-06-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:57:19Z","rounded_local_amount":697.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52994332,"comment":null},{"amount":187.4,"local_amount":713.91,"processed_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-06T10:59:31Z","rounded_local_amount":719.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63215601,"comment":null},{"amount":193.34,"local_amount":736.52,"processed_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-10T10:24:41Z","rounded_local_amount":741.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73645093,"comment":null},{"amount":199.46,"local_amount":759.84,"processed_date":"2009-09-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-14T09:15:16Z","rounded_local_amount":765.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87084623,"comment":null},{"amount":205.78,"local_amount":783.91,"processed_date":"2009-10-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-04T09:29:32Z","rounded_local_amount":789.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97000844,"comment":null},{"amount":212.29,"local_amount":808.73,"processed_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-25T09:22:10Z","rounded_local_amount":814.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103846212,"comment":null},{"amount":219.01,"local_amount":834.33,"processed_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-10T08:42:19Z","rounded_local_amount":840.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110737313,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-04-15T01:04:24Z","paid_date":"2010-02-10T08:42:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":101153,"name":"Khader","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Khader A. is a devoted father who is extremely dedicated to his work.

R.E.C. Primary School Waterloo was founded in 1926 by the government. R.E.C Waterloo has a total number of 546 pupils and a total number of fourteen staff. \r\n\r\nSince 2006, when Nafisatu A. T. took over the administration of the school, R.E.C Primary School Waterloo has been producing good results at the National Primary School Exams (NPSE). However, like many schools in Sierra Leone, REC Waterloo lacks adequate classrooms, seating accommodations and adequate learning and teaching materials.\r\n\r\nThis will be the first loan for teachers of the R.E.C Primary School from SMT\/Kiva. Government salaries are usually quite small for teachers, thus making teaching an unattractive profession for many whose primary motivator is money. Many choose other jobs over teaching because of the small salary, thus starving the field of qualified personnel to teach the children. The few who remain in the classrooms have to find other ways of making ends meet. The vast majority of them engage in either businesses or agriculture or they provide extra tutorial classes for the children (although this is a practice the government is trying to stop).\r\n<p>\r\nNeedless to say, loans from SMT are a great help to the teachers in order to boost their businesses or investing it in something productive. Many want to go to school but could not afford the cost. Some will want to buy pieces of furniture, but their monthly salary is not enough to let them do so. With a loan, they will be able to meet some of these needs.  And with their monthly salaries, they can repay easily via a payroll deduction type of system.\r\n\r\nNafisatu A. T. (left) is the head teacher of R.E.C Primary School Waterloo. She was born in Matotoka village, Tonkolili district, northern Sierra Leone.  She is fifty-four years of age and married with four children. One is already an adult and three are still attending schools. She has been a teacher for thirty-six years now. Nafisatu will use this loan to buy bundles of corrugated iron zinc to roof her house.  She does not expect to complete the roofing of her house with this loan, but with subsequent loans, however, she will certainly complete the roofing of her house.

She sewed various clothes for children, using a manual sewing machine. After lots of hard work she has expanded the business by purchasing two automatic sewing machines. Her business capital has increased from 150,000 MNT ($1 USD=1500 MNT) to 1,800,000 MNT.\r\n<p>\r\nShe requests a loan to purchase more raw materials for sewing traditional costumes. In April and May, there will be graduation ceremonies for colleges and universities.  In Mongolia, it is a tradition for girls to wear traditional costumes during their graduation ceremonies, which causes demand for traditional costumes to spike.

In his yard he has two cows.  In addition, he has nearly two tons of hay and other cattle feed.  Unfortunately, last year it was cold and there was nothing to feed the cattle.  Due to the cold ground, there was little grass in the meadows.  However, this year he thanks God that there is a lot of grass in the pastures and the cows and sheep can eat their fill.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Joyce ., Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":302712,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase of livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Kostakoz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.198611 69.81","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":"2009-04-13T15:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Homid","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":262.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":262.5,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-10-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-04T09:35:14Z","rounded_local_amount":1007.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97000851,"comment":null},{"amount":262.5,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-11-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-25T09:23:00Z","rounded_local_amount":1007.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103846216,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-04-20T03:34:28Z","paid_date":"2009-12-25T09:23:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":101219,"name":"Chanthy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Chanthy K., 43, and her husband, Mr. Pov Thorn, 44, were married in 1988 and have four children: three sons and one daughter.

She has joined TYM Fund since 2003. She used her first loan of 2,000,000 VND (115 USD) to buy inventories for her sundry goods store. After efficient uses of five loans, Mrs. L. and her family have been able to start another job: to husk rice. With the monthly income of 3,000,000 VND (or 172 USD) from these two jobs combined, Mrs. L.'s family's life has been much improved. This time she would like to borrow 17,000,000 VND (or 975 USD) to have more funds investing in her store and buy a few more tools to husk rice.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by

T. lives in the town of Isfara in the Sugd region of Tajikistan. Her husband works far away from home, currently in Russia. Together they have two school-aged children. Ozodakhon has to spend a lot of money on their education because her husband doesn\u2019t earn enough. She cares for two cows, and would now like to borrow $1200 USD to buy more calves. In this way she hopes to earn more and cover all her dear children's expenses. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan<\/b><br>\r\nTajikistan, a key post on the Silk Road, is perhaps best known for its rich history. It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about IMON International <\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

he was very young, Abdulahad S. has felt connected to the countryside. His family dedicated themselves to cultivating fruits and vegetables, and from childhood he imagined he would be in the business of selling produce. Fortunately, he realized this dream, and at the age of 20, he began to sell vegetables in small markets. Meanwhile, little by little, he was saving money so he could set up his own shop. Thanks to his efforts and the love he has for this work, Abdulahad\u2019s business has been growing gradually. Now Abdulahad believes it is time to inject more capital into the business so that he can buy at wholesale and obtain better prices. As a result, he is requesting a loan of $1950 USD. With your help, Abdulahad will be able to move his business forward and offer his wife and two children a better future.    \n\nMore about Tajikistan\nTajikistan, a key post on the Silk Road, is perhaps best known for its rich history. It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \n\nMore about IMON International \nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Mrs. M. has participated in the TYM Fund since 2006. She used her first loan of 2,000,000 VND (119 USD) to invest in raising pigs.  Since then, in later lending cycles she and her family were able to use loans to invest in raising ducks. Currently, with an income of 2,500,000 VND (148 USD) per month, their lives are gradually becoming more secure.  In the next round of lending, she hopes to borrow 8,000,000 VND (475 USD) to buy more ducks and animal feed.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by Robert Sides, Kiva

Mahmadrasul is 45 years old. He is married with four children. He has his own grocery store where he sells different kinds of foodstuffs like macaroni, cookies, soft drinks, juices, tea, detergents and many others. He started this business 14 years ago with a small inventory of foodstuffs and, over time, he expanded his business and now his business has become very successful.\n\nToday, Mahmadrasul is requesting a loan of $2600 to increase his stock. He is ready to work even harder, make sacrifices and push every once in a while to achieve his goal and become a successful entrepreneur. One of his dreams is that his children progress by means of their studies, for which he is doing the best he can. We believe his perseverance and clear vision will become key success factors in his small business.     \n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and for it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after Tajikistan\u2019s independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \n\nIMON's History\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is married and has three children.  He completed secondary school and has nine years of experience in sales.  Muzaffar has collaborated with MicroInvest since 2006, when he received a loan to expand his business.  He sells alcoholic beverages and soft drinks in a store.  There is also a freezer where ice cream is kept.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \n\nIMON's History\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

Rumy region.  He is 30 years old, is married, but does not have children.  He is a farmer.  He has a plot of land where he plants wheat and other cereal crops.  He has been in this business for 10 years now.  He sells his harvest at the market, but keeps part of it for himself and his family.  In order to purchase wheat seeds and fertilizer he decided to turn to us for credit.  This will help him to purchase quality seeds and fertilizer when it is time and to collect a quality harvest and provide markets with quality wheat.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by

She has been a member of the TYM Fund since 1994.  Currently, she and her husband raise animals and grow crops on their own land.  Each month, in addition to the income they earn from raising animals, her husband receives a steady retirement pension and their children provide some financial support.  Their total income is 5,000,000 VND (288 USD) per month.  In the next round of lending, Mrs. Qu\u1ebf hopes to borrow 20,000,000 VND (1150 USD) to buy pigs, chickens, and animal feed.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by Robert Sides, Kiva

In 1996, Mrs. T. became a member of the TYM Fund and used a loan to invest in raising pigs.  Today, besides raising animals, she also uses loans from the Fund to buy raw materials for producing tofu and brewing wine to sell.  With a total monthly income of 4,500,000 VND (255 USD), the lives of Mrs. T. and her family are steadily improving and becoming more secure.  In the next round of lending, she hopes to borrow 15,000,000 VND (850 USD) to buy soybeans for making tofu and rice for making rice wine in order to increase her family\u2019s earnings from these

Her husband died at young age, and she had not money to do business, therefore her family faced economic hardship previously. After joining TYM Fund, she borrowed money to raise livestock and set up a general store. Currently, these are the businesses that bring the major source of income for her family at VND2,500,000 per month.\r\n<p>\r\nIn this loan cycle, she wishes to borrow VND10,000,000 to buy more foodstuff to resell to the local community. She also hopes that in the future the Fund continues to lend with a higher amount to invest in business.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by Tu Duong, Kiva

Lo que le gusta de su trabajo es que conoce muchos lugares y trata con algunas personas que le ense\u00f1an t\u00e9cnicas y estrategias para aumentar sus ganancias en el tipo de labor que realiza. En la ciudad de Pucallpa, el principal medio de transporte es el motocarro, por ello, le es rentable, ya que el mismo maneja y administra sus ganancias diarias. Arturo considera que lo m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil de su trabajo es cuando no tiene en buenas condiciones su veh\u00edculo y no contar con un garaje para guardarlo. Con MFP, ya tiene 8 pr\u00e9stamos, y le gusta mucho trabajar con su banco comunal porque los integrantes son unidos y puntuales en los pagos.

For 7 years now he has provided transportation services with his own motor-car.  He works all day because he is a single father and wants to take care of his own needs; his children are now grown and have their own families.  What he enjoys about his work is that he gets to know a lot of places and he tries to learn from some people the technical aspects of his work and strategies for increasing the income he earns from his type of business.  The principal mode of transportation within the city of Pucallpa is by moto-car.  For this reason, his enterprise is profitable given that he himself drives his vehicle and administers his daily earnings.  Arturo considers the most difficult aspect of his business to be when his moto-car is in disrepair, and not having a garage to use for storage.  He already has had 8 loans with MFP, and he enjoys working with the cooperative bank greatly because the members are united and timely with their loan payments.  Arturo wants to invest the funds he is requesting into repairs for his moto-car, specifically for some replacement parts, for which he will spend 1,000 soles.  He will invest the remaining funds into his crops in order to have a good harvest.   He has 18 hectares of palmetto trees.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":302998,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","use":"To maintain his moto-car, and invest into his crops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-04-14T19:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Arturo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3500,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":386.21},{"due_date":"2009-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":392.7},{"due_date":"2009-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":408.93},{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":422.71},{"due_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":448.45},{"due_date":"2009-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":461.87},{"due_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":480.97},{"due_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":498.16}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.14},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":126.22},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.44},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.87},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":144.14},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":148.46},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":154.6},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":160.13}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":124.13,"local_amount":386.21,"processed_date":"2009-04-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:47:45Z","rounded_local_amount":390.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012428,"comment":null},{"amount":126.22,"local_amount":392.7,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:59:20Z","rounded_local_amount":396.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44596017,"comment":null},{"amount":131.44,"local_amount":408.93,"processed_date":"2009-06-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:42:12Z","rounded_local_amount":413.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990281,"comment":null},{"amount":135.88,"local_amount":422.71,"processed_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:43:51Z","rounded_local_amount":427.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211406,"comment":null},{"amount":144.14,"local_amount":448.45,"processed_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:24:39Z","rounded_local_amount":453.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640915,"comment":null},{"amount":148.46,"local_amount":461.87,"processed_date":"2009-09-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:37:30Z","rounded_local_amount":466.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080382,"comment":null},{"amount":154.6,"local_amount":480.97,"processed_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:09:48Z","rounded_local_amount":486.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996565,"comment":null},{"amount":160.13,"local_amount":498.16,"processed_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:55:19Z","rounded_local_amount":503.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842065,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-04-18T15:05:54Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T13:55:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":101335,"name":"Isidro","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Isidro vive con sus 3 hijos en su domicilio que es propio y que se encuentra ubicado en Villa Candelaria.

three children. Her husband is buying and reselling cattle on the cattle market and she feeds the cattle at home. She has one milk cow and two calves.

Apauline goes to the little local markets in Benin to buy the cereals that she re-sells at the market of  Gb\u00e9gamey. As for condiments for sauces, Apauline buys her supplies in the international market of Benin. She has already had two loans through ALID\u00e9.

H\u1eb1ng has been engaged in this business for over five years and earns approximately $145 a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, H\u1eb1ng joined TYM Fund, a Kiva field partner, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities.  H\u1eb1ng has successfully repaid a previous loan from TYM Fund.  This previous loan was used to purchase young livestock to raise and sell in the future.  H\u1eb1ng is now requesting a new loan of $700 which will be used to purchase breeding livestock.  The loan will be the tenth loan taken out by the borrower from TYM Fund.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from providing general alteration and tailoring services to local community members.  Th\u1ea3o has been engaged in this business for over five years and earns approximately $175 a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, Th\u1ea3o joined TYM Fund, a Kiva field partner, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities.  Th\u1ea3o has successfully repaid a previous loan from TYM Fund.  This previous loan was used to purchase additional fabrics and materials.  Th\u1ea3o is now requesting a new loan of $575, which again will be used to buy fabric and other sewing materials.  This will be the fifth loan taken out by the borrower from TYM Fund.

Saodat is a hard-working woman and since 1996 has dedicated herself to selling a variety of vegetables in the central market of Dushanbe. She characterized herself as happy and humble. She started her business with her savings which she had accumulated over a long period of time. She is the mother of 4 children that she would like to offer an education as they are minors. <P>\r\n\r\nHer biggest dream is to prepare her children to have professions so they don't have to suffer like she did since childhood, working at hard labor. To realize this dream, Saodat now requests 1000 USD for a term of 9 months. With this loan she wants to buy more goods to increase her earnings.  <P> \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n<>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

S. is an enterprising woman with a big desire to improve the quality of life of her family. She is married and the mother of three children. Because of difficult living conditions and the lack of a job her husband had to leave for Russia for employment. \r\n<P>\r\nNargis has been a seamstress since she was very young, learning in her mother's office. She was able to open her own shop at her home 20 years ago and has been successful because her customers have recognized the high quality of her products. In this way, she constantly adds new clients and has seen her business grow. Today Nargis is applying for a loan from IMON International for the second time. She is requesting a loan of US $1050 for the term of 10 months to purchase spring fabrics for sewing the national dress. You can help improve the quality of life of Nargis\u2019s family.   \r\n<P>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n<P>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<P>\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<P>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is married and the mother of three, plus she has two other people to support.  Having lacked the chance to excel in school due to a lack of financial means, she soon got started in an apprenticeship for making bread (baking) with the help of her parents.  At the end of her training, thanks to her know-how, she quickly won over the trust of her customers through the quality of her product.  Right now, the demand exceeds the supply, but Ms. K. doesn\u2019t have the means necessary to respond to the need.  She\u2019s therefore requesting financing to get situated appropriately, to get supplies of flour and sugar, and to equip herself with tools of the trade.  The revenues derived from this work will enable her to do better in helping to cover family expenses and to provide the right education for her children.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback micro-finance facility.<P>\r\n\r\n Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. <P>\r\n\r\nOne of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":303310,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase items in bulk for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-04-14T16:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abigail M.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":800000,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2009-05-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:16:32Z","rounded_local_amount":138229.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613677,"comment":null},{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:03:55Z","rounded_local_amount":138229.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010756,"comment":null},{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:40:25Z","rounded_local_amount":138229.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63233042,"comment":null},{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2009-08-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:55:04Z","rounded_local_amount":138229.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664833,"comment":null},{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:49:01Z","rounded_local_amount":138229.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105545,"comment":null},{"amount":104.15,"local_amount":133333.35,"processed_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:33:35Z","rounded_local_amount":138229.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022670,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-04-15T13:02:50Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T06:33:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":101462,"name":"Rosario Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El grupo Rosario est\u00e1 conformado en su mayor\u00eda por mujeres con la presencia de un solo hombre que se dedica a la venta de periodicos y revistas y es el socio que demuestra mayor responsabilidad, pero en general las socias se dedican a la venta de diferentes productos pero por la misma actividad que realizan necesitan a menudo mayor capital de trabajo por esta raz\u00f3n estas socias quieren seguir trabajando con Agrocaptal pues consideran que con nosotros tienen alguna ventaja. por lo mismo la presidenta en alguna ocaci\u00f3n realiza charlas de reflexi\u00f3n a las socias.","en":"The Rosario group is made up of primarily women and only one man.

In the future, she plans to open a new business. Bupe thanks you for your support!\n\nABOUT SELFINA:\n\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":303317,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase commodities in bulk for retail sale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Kyela","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-9.583333 33.85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-04-17T17:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bupe A.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-05-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:15:50Z","rounded_local_amount":88466.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613678,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:04:04Z","rounded_local_amount":88466.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010757,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:40:40Z","rounded_local_amount":88466.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63233043,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-08-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:55:22Z","rounded_local_amount":88466.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664834,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:49:31Z","rounded_local_amount":88466.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105546,"comment":null},{"amount":66.65,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:30:14Z","rounded_local_amount":88466.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022671,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-04-17T20:23:46Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T06:30:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":101467,"name":"Florentina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nNuestra socia es la sra.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":303336,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"To buy crops in bulk for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Kyela","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-9.583333 33.85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-04-17T17:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Christabela N.

Since her schooling was cut short due to a lack of financial means, she soon undertook an apprenticeship in hairdressing and braiding.  Currently, she is finished with her training and wants to get situated and on her own but doesn\u2019t have the resources.  Nevertheless, with her initiative, she is for the moment successful in doing braids at a crossroads location in order to find substantial revenues for getting situated properly and to open her own workshop.  During the Easter season, when the demand for braids from women and girls is very high, she\u2019s requesting financing for supplies of hair extensions and <i>chouchouvi<\/i>.  Her customers would be able to buy hair extensions directly from her for braiding.  Thus, she will be able to make a profit from selling hair extensions, in addition to her handiwork.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":303351,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase red palm seeds in bulk for oil extraction","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Kyela","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-9.583333 33.85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-04-17T17:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Enesi D.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":303373,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase stock crops in bulk for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-04-14T19:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Esta S.

This is 26-year-old Jeniffer N. from Mwanza. She is married with two children, 1 and 8 years old. Jeniffer has been running a clothes business since 2008, selling used clothes. Second-hand clothes journey across the oceans from America and Europe, and are then washed, ironed and sold in bulk by wholesalers in Tanzania to retailers who then re-wash and re-iron them for sale on the streets and in the surrounding towns and villages. These clothes are becoming increasingly popular, especially amongst the younger generation, because of their low cost, and the general appeal of anything modern. <P>\r\n\r\nJeniffer works at the business for 12 hours per day, 6 days per week and is assisted by one employee.

Hato Mayor is one of the provinces with the lowest population in Dominican Republic, and many of its inhabitants are forced to perform their work activities elsewhere, or commute to other provinces to work. This results in an additional burden to their businesses and families, as on many occasions, our clients have to be away from home either for work or to restock their inventory. \r\n\r\nAltagracia S. has been appointed as group representative. She has 4 children; the oldest is 19 and the youngest is 6. Her group mates recognize her as a leader and trust her to do a good job in keeping the group together. Altagracia has set up a clothing sales business, so she will use her loan to buy new clothes to sell. For the present time, she will sell from her own home and visit her acquaintances with her merchandise. She hopes to eventually set up a store where her customers can come to her instead. She also wants to start building a house with her sales profits and be able to help her children acquire a college education. \r\n\r\nPlease help us support this group of new micro entrepreneurs

One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that is allows clients to use the leased equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":303390,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase rice in bulk for her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Kyela","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-9.583333 33.85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-04-14T21:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatuma H.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-05-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:16:14Z","rounded_local_amount":88466.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613691,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:03:38Z","rounded_local_amount":88466.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010770,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:41:43Z","rounded_local_amount":88466.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63233056,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-08-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:56:08Z","rounded_local_amount":88466.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664847,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:51:48Z","rounded_local_amount":88466.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105559,"comment":null},{"amount":66.65,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:33:56Z","rounded_local_amount":88466.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022681,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-04-14T23:53:34Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T06:33:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":101516,"name":"Aurora","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Aurora es casada, tiene 34 a\u00f1os de edad y es madre de 6 hijos.

She sells food in the evenings in a spot away from home where she also sets up tables and chairs for her guests to eat. She has been doing this for three years now and likes to take time preparing each dish properly so that her customers can fully enjoy their delicious taste. She also likes to talk to people whilst serving them. This is a highly lucrative business for Aurora since she finds cooking easy and is able to prepare special dishes both quickly and inexpensively, and which prove very popular. It is for this reason that she plans to own a restaurant in the future. She has previously obtained 5 loans from MFP and happily participates in her local communal bank, as everyone is well-coordinated and supportive of each other.

This is 56 year old Avelina G. from Mwanza. She is married with four children, between the ages of 24 and 34 years old. Additionally, she is responsible for supporting one dependant because her parents do not take care of her. Avelina has been running a poultry or \"Kuku\" business since 2008. Raising kuku is a popular micro-business in Tanzania, especially amongst SELFINA clients. Kuku means chickens in Swahili, and raising them for sale is popular for a number of reasons. Firstly, they require little start-up capital. You can start with one or two, and either add to them as you go, or wait for them to multiply naturally! Secondly, they require little space, so sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. Thirdly, while they are growing they produce eggs, which can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income, or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein. Avelina works at the business for 4 hours per day, 7 days per week and currently earns about 120USD from her business. She is requesting a loan of 400USD in order to purchase chickens and raise them. In the future, she plans to expand her business. Avelina thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":303401,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase chickens and raise them","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-04-14T20:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Avelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:14:44Z","rounded_local_amount":53080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613692,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:02:31Z","rounded_local_amount":53080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010771,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:39:19Z","rounded_local_amount":53080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63233057,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:53Z","rounded_local_amount":53080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664848,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:46:46Z","rounded_local_amount":53080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105560,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-10-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:27:23Z","rounded_local_amount":53080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022682,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:41:47Z","rounded_local_amount":53080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103867928,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:44:43Z","rounded_local_amount":53080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757129,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:29Z","rounded_local_amount":53080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146241,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-02-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:15:54Z","rounded_local_amount":53080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123984403,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-04-15T11:44:33Z","paid_date":"2010-03-15T11:15:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":101525,"name":"Maria Elena","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Maria tiene 43 a\u00f1os de edad, reside en el barrio Laureles Norte en la ciudad de Managua, tiene un hijo que estudia la secundaria, su negocio es la venta de ropa desde hace diez a\u00f1os, la cual inicio con prestamos que Afodenic otorgo para seguir adelante, este es su d\u00e9cimo ciclo y va a invertir en infraestructura en la compra de materiales de construcci\u00f3n para hacer el porche de su casa y poder dar mejores condiciones a su familia.

This is 32 year old Getruda Mpiyila from Mbeya. She is married with 2 children, between the ages of 2 and 5. Getruda has been running a salon business since 1997. Gertruda's beauty salon is a place where her friends and fellow women can gather and literally let their hair down.  Most beauty salons in Tanzania are places where you can buy long hair, short hair, curly hair, straight hair, red hair, blue hair, and then have it attached to your head, woven, cut, or braided, and made to look like your own.  Gertruda works at the business for 9-12 hours per day, 7 days per week and currently earns about 160USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of 375USD in order to purchase rastas and cosmetics for her salon. In the future, she plans to start a new business. Getruda thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":303407,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"To

Customers can scrutinize the quality of the product before they purchase it and can specify the exact amount that they would like to purchase.

One of her yearnings is to be able to have a decent house.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jay Osborne, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":303420,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"Buy construction materials to change the roof of her house, which is in a bad state.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2009-04-15T18:50:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Imelda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":6000,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25.35,"local_amount":507.02,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:24:12Z","rounded_local_amount":513.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44384376,"comment":null},{"amount":55.74,"local_amount":1114.89,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T16:32:29Z","rounded_local_amount":1128.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52890829,"comment":null},{"amount":26.37,"local_amount":527.47,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T09:38:25Z","rounded_local_amount":534.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63112135,"comment":null},{"amount":24.86,"local_amount":497.29,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T09:52:56Z","rounded_local_amount":503.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73533537,"comment":null},{"amount":25.49,"local_amount":509.75,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T10:03:36Z","rounded_local_amount":516.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86964899,"comment":null},{"amount":25.05,"local_amount":500.95,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T10:54:33Z","rounded_local_amount":507.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96875353,"comment":null},{"amount":24.99,"local_amount":499.86,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T10:46:39Z","rounded_local_amount":506.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103713295,"comment":null},{"amount":24.08,"local_amount":481.5,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T10:57:00Z","rounded_local_amount":487.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110600996,"comment":null},{"amount":25.07,"local_amount":501.49,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T07:52:56Z","rounded_local_amount":507.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123840656,"comment":null},{"amount":43,"local_amount":859.78,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T07:50:17Z","rounded_local_amount":870.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128873612,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-04-15T20:38:11Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T07:50:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":101538,"name":"Martha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mambo from Tanzania!

Martha thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA!\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sum"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":303419,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pharmacy","sector":"Health","use":"To purchase medicine to sell to customers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-04-14T20:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Martha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:14:43Z","rounded_local_amount":106160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613696,"comment":null},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-06-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:02:29Z","rounded_local_amount":106160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010775,"comment":null},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-07-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:39:16Z","rounded_local_amount":106160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63233061,"comment":null},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:53:31Z","rounded_local_amount":106160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664852,"comment":null},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:46:40Z","rounded_local_amount":106160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105564,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-04-15T02:44:14Z","paid_date":"2009-10-16T02:46:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":101539,"name":"Rachet\u00e9s Plus Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Elisa N. vend des vivres frais et des \u00e9pices.

from Tanzania! This is 37-year-old Zanifa K. from Mwanza. She is married with two children, 15 and 18 years old. Additionally, she is responsible for supporting one dependent because her parents do not take care of her. Zanifa has been running a beauty salon since 2007. This is the place where you can buy long hair, short hair, curly hair, straight hair, red hair, blue hair, and then have it attached to your head, woven, cut, or braided, and made to look like your own. <P>\r\n\r\nZanifa works at the business for 12 hours per day, 6 days per week and is assisted by two employees. Zanifa currently earns about 200 USD from her business. She is requesting a loan of 400 USD in order to buy more dryers for her salon. In the future, she plans to expand her business. Zanifa thanks you for your support!<P>\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA!<P>\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. <P>\r\n\r\nCustoms and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. <P>\r\n\r\nOne of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":303425,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","use":"To buy more dryers for her salon","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-04-14T20:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zanifa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:14:44Z","rounded_local_amount":106160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613697,"comment":null},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-06-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:02:30Z","rounded_local_amount":106160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010776,"comment":null},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-07-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:39:18Z","rounded_local_amount":106160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63233062,"comment":null},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:51Z","rounded_local_amount":106160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664853,"comment":null},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:46:44Z","rounded_local_amount":106160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105565,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-04-15T15:39:02Z","paid_date":"2009-10-16T02:46:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":101541,"name":"Atasse","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Atasse A. est un jeune homme de 37 ans, mari\u00e9 et p\u00e8re de 2 enfants. il est propri\u00e9taire d\u2019un d\u00e9p\u00f4t des produits FanMilk.

Only the oldest is in school.  Calisto left Inhambane for Namaacha, a town on the border of Swaziland, after he finished the 5th grade.  His oldest brother was transferred to Namaacha and he came with him.  When he arrived he continued with his studies, and consequently he earned a scholarship to be a legal assistant.  He found work in the courts as a legal assistant, but as his institution was not acredited, he did not have the right to a salary.\r\n\r\nThe school entered into contracts, and he was one of the beneficiaries.  He is already on the staff as an assistant instructor.  He works from 7:00am until 12:00pm and earn a monthly sum of 5,900MT.  Besides teaching he has also does advocacy work for his clients who, in spite of being delayed, have had success in the cause process.  Calisto, with help from his wife, who is a health official, was able to collect enough money to begin his work, but he was unable to finish so he approached Hluvuku and solicited a loan for 15,000MT to continue because the rain causes his bricks to break very easily.\r\n\r\nBesides his children, he is responsible for  his sister and nephew who live with him in his house.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and lease-back microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions.

Agnes M. from Mwanza is 45 years old and married with four children between the ages of 18 and 24. Agnes has been running a business selling charcoal since 2005. Charcoal is used by many Tanzanians as a fuel to cook their daily meals. Women cook food in small coal pots, in which they arrange mkaa (charcoal), and add paper, dry grass, old plastic bags or kerosene in order to light it. \r\n<p>\r\nAs there is such a high demand across the country, being a charcoal seller is quite lucrative! Agnes works at the business for twelve hours per day, seven days a week, and is assisted by one employee. She currently earns about $150 USD from her business, and is requesting a loan of $400 USD in order to purchase more charcoal and resell it. In the future, she plans to open another business. Agnes thanks you for your support!\r\n<p>\r\n<b>About SELFINA<\/b><br>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of microcredit in Tanzania through microleasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and lease-back microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

from Tanzania! This is 29 year old Veronika K. from Mwanza. She is married with three children, between the ages of 5 and 9 years old. Veronika has been running a grains business since 2004. Veronika sells rice, maize and wheat flour. She works at the business for 12 hours a day, 6 days per week and is assisted by two employees. Veronika currently earns about 220USD from her business. She is requesting a loan of 400USD in order to purchase more rice to resell. In the future, she plans to open another business. Veronika thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA!\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":303467,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pharmacy","sector":"Health","use":"To purchase

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.<\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":303475,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To

What is best about her business is that both with the meals and the bread production she makes daily profits with which she is able to pay for the family's basic needs; on the other hand, the sale of her poultry happens every 35 days which is the time it takes for the chicks to mature enough to be ready for sale.  She has four loans with MFP and likes working with her communal bank because of the support, respect and responsibility that exists among its members.  The money she asks for now will be divided equally among her three activities:  food preparation, raw materials for her baked goods, and an increase in the number of chicks she raises and sells.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":303539,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To invest in her three businesses.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-04-15T23:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mayte","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":220.75},{"due_date":"2009-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":224.46},{"due_date":"2009-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":233.74},{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":241.61},{"due_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":256.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":263.99},{"due_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":274.92},{"due_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":284.2}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.74},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.95},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.97},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.52},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.31},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.8},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.35},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.36}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":71.74,"local_amount":220.75,"processed_date":"2009-04-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:47:56Z","rounded_local_amount":221.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012442,"comment":null},{"amount":72.95,"local_amount":224.46,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:02:47Z","rounded_local_amount":225.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44596031,"comment":null},{"amount":75.97,"local_amount":233.74,"processed_date":"2009-06-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:42:04Z","rounded_local_amount":234.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990295,"comment":null},{"amount":78.52,"local_amount":241.61,"processed_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:44:22Z","rounded_local_amount":242.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211420,"comment":null},{"amount":83.31,"local_amount":256.33,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:29:31Z","rounded_local_amount":257.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640929,"comment":null},{"amount":85.8,"local_amount":263.99,"processed_date":"2009-09-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:37:58Z","rounded_local_amount":265.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080396,"comment":null},{"amount":89.35,"local_amount":274.92,"processed_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:11:45Z","rounded_local_amount":276.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996579,"comment":null},{"amount":92.36,"local_amount":284.2,"processed_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:55:13Z","rounded_local_amount":285.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842079,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-04-17T12:59:39Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T13:55:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":101589,"name":"Miriam","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Miriam de 49 a\u00f1os, vive junto a su esposo y su \u00fanica hija en casa propia.

This is 30 year old Rehema S. from Mbeya. She is single with no children.\r\nRehema has been running a clothes shop since 2008. She owns a shop in the city where she sells various types of new clothes. She works at the business for 12 hours per day, 6 days per week. Rehema currently earns about 80USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of 375USD in order to purchase more clothes in bulk. In the future, she plans to open a new business. Rehema thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions.

S.","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mambo (Greetings!) from Tanzania! This is 35-year-old Sekela M. from Kyela. She is single with one child, age 12. Sekela has been running a crops-selling business since 2001. A typical maize business is a stand on the side of the road where maize is often piled high in baskets.  Customers can scrutinize the quality of the product before purchase and specify the exact amount they would like to purchase. Maize is very important to the Tanzanian culture as maize is used to make one of their staple dishes, ugali. Ugali is made solely of maize flour and water.\nShe works at the business for 9 - 12 hours per day, 6 days per week. Sekela currently earns about 130USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of 400 USD in order to purchase more beans in bulk. In the future, she plans to establish another business. Sekela thanks you for your support!\n\nABOUT SELFINA:\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":303698,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase more beans in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Kyela","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-9.583333 33.85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-04-17T17:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sekela S.

He gives at least PHP 200.00 per day to the tricycle owner as his boundary and the rest of his income is for his family.  Aside from working as a lease tricycle driver, Arturo is also busy on his farm where he plants and sells vegetables for extra income.  With this, he wants to borrow a loan of PHP 8,000.00 that he will use in cultivating his vegetables.  He is hoping that through his business, he can provide a better life for his family and hopefully he can have his own motorcycle in the future.

Erlinda, being a young mother is trying her best to become a good mother to her three children.

She hopes to buy a piglet to raise in her vacant pig housing where she could invest some of her income from vending. She also sometimes sells fruits when she has extra capital. Erlinda is now requesting a loan of PHP5,000. She is dreaming of having more income and savings for the future of her family, especially her three daughters. She wants to send all her children to school. That is why she is trying to exert more effort in selling and at the same time pursue her planned hog raising somehow.
