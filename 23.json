M., was born in 1950 in Catembe, Maputo Province. His father was a cook and his mother a teacher. Jossefa studied until the 3rd grade.\r\n\r\nBecause Jossefa lost his parents at a young age, he started working as an assistant painter at the age of 17. He became a painter and worked for the Portuguese, who left Mozambique in 1974. After they left Jossefa used his savings to buy a boat, and started his fishing activities using a fishing rod.\r\n\r\nWith his gains, Joseffa was able to buy fishing nets, and hire 9 workers with whom he worked with until the 2000 flood. Because of the flood Joseffa lost his nets and had to lay off the workers.\r\n<p>\r\nWith government help he returned to fishing, with great difficultym, which led him to borrow from HLUVUKU in order to buy nets. He has taken 4 loans with which he has bought a boat and the engine.\r\nAt this time Jossefa has 2 boats and 2 engines. He rents the second boat to friends. He has hired 6 full time workers and 2 part time helpers. He cares for 12 family members, including his children and grandchildren.\r\n<p>\r\nWith the loan of 21.000,00MT Joseffa will buy new fishing nets, and maintain the engine and boats.\r\nJoseffa\u2019s work has a great impact in his community because it creates jobs and provides fish, and other seafood products for the markets of the city of Maputo.\r\nIn the future Joseffa plans on purchasing a bigger boat and more sophisticated nets, which will allow him to increase his income and create more jobs. \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Portuguese by Mariana Komatsuzaki Fraga, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p> \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLocaliza\u00e7\u00e3o: Guachene - Catembe\r\nActividade: Pesca\r\nValor Financiado: 21.000,00MT (840.00US$)\r\nAplica\u00e7\u00e3o do montante: Compra de redes de Pesca \r\n\r\nIn\u00edcio: 09\/05\/2007\r\nFim: 30\/04\/2008\r\n\r\n\r\nJossefa M., nascido em 1950 na Catembe, Prov\u00edncia de Maputo, Filho de Pai Cozinheiro e M\u00e3e Professora estudou at\u00e9 3\u00aa Classe.\r\n\r\nPor ter perdido os seus pais cedo, aos dezassete anos come\u00e7ou a trabalhar como ajudante de pintor onde se tornou mestre e trabalhou para patr\u00f5es Portugueses, os quais deixam Mo\u00e7ambique em 1974, facto que levou-o a usar o valor acumulado para compra de um barco, iniciando assim a actividade de pesca por anz\u00f3is.\r\n\r\nCom o rendimento conseguiu comprar redes e contratou 9 trabalhadores com os quais trabalhou at\u00e9  ao per\u00edodo das  cheias de 2000 onde perdeu redes e teve que dispensa-los .\r\n\r\nCom ajuda do governo reactivou a sua actividade mas com ligeiras dificuldades o que\u2013lhe levou a recorreu ao empr\u00e9stimo na HLUVUKU para refor\u00e7ar as redes e reparar o motor do barco.

So the more working capital they have, the more scrap they can collect and recycle. Uum and her husband are the first link in this chain, buying waste and scrap materials from households, sorting and cleaning them, before selling them to an intermediate dealer. This dealer comes around in a small truck, collects the sorted-out material and takes it to the warehouses dealer. There, the different materials are weighed in front of Uum\u2019s husband, who then gets paid by the intermediate dealer. The warehouse dealer in turn sends the waste materials to various processing factories, which turn produce clean and reusable recycled paper, cardboard and plastic recycled raw materials. Waste recycling undertaken by Uum and her husband thus helps clean the environment by reusing waste material which otherwise would go to the landfills. In a week Uum can earn $6.

For 13 years she has operated her business as a tailor in Myanga market in the Bungoma District of Western Kenya.  With 5 sewing machines and one employee, her business is comprised of a diversity of activities. They include buying clothes second hand, repairing them and then reselling; tailoring dresses and suits for individual clients; selling pre-made uniforms to primary schools; as well as training young women how to be tailors.<p>Anna is currently training 5 young women in the skill of tailoring. Charging her students 7,000 Kenyan Schillings per year, they work at the 3 extra sewing machines not being used by Anna or her employee. This is of great benefit to the community, as Anna is able to provide young women with the skills they will need to attain employment and open their own tailoring centers. Anna herself was trained at Naitiri Youth Polytechnic, but not all women have the opportunity to attend established institutions.<p>Anna gives the clothes that she repairs to her husband to sell at the market. The clothing includes Vitenge dresses and Kaunda suits, the traditional clothing in the area. Her greatest specialty that separates her from other tailors, however, is her production of ready made uniforms for primary schools. Whereas other tailors lack the ability to prepare ready made school uniforms, Anna has already established relationships with multiple primary schools that she sells to. Along with being another example of how Anna provides for her community, it also represents a consistent and stable demand for her products.<p>According to Anna, the greatest challenge to her business has been a lack of capital to meet demand. With her new loan, she will purchase the necessary cloths and threads to expand the capacity of her tailoring shop. With this increased capacity, she hopes to grow profits and continue to pay for her family's basic necessities, including food and children\u2019s school fees.<p>While primary education is supposedly free in Kenya, there are still many other expenses that families face, including uniforms, books, tests, school upkeep, etc. Moreover, the steep costs of high school education must be completely paid by families\u2014which makes secondary education a product of tremendous sacrifice, and in some cases an impossibility. Anna hopes that her business will ensure that her children can attain an education that will help them in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":40401,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","use":"To purchase material and thread to increase production","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Myanga, Bungoma District","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":27,"posted_date":"2007-06-06T18:47:54Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anna Aya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-06-21T01:48:48Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":150,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2007-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2007-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2007-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2007-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2007-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2007-07-21T09:17:03Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-21T10:16:59Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":34117,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2007-08-21T09:17:28Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-21T10:16:59Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":45002,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2007-09-21T09:17:42Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-21T10:16:59Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":57032,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2007-10-21T09:17:29Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-21T10:16:59Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":70228,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2007-11-21T10:17:37Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-21T10:16:59Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":84524,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2007-12-21T10:16:59Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-21T10:16:59Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":100507,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2007-06-07T01:48:48Z","paid_date":"2007-12-21T10:16:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":11343,"name":"Rita Nanjala","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rita is a 43 year old mother of 10 who sells tomatoes, onions, and fish at a roadside stand in Myanga, Bungoma Distrcit. Her small business has been operating since 1986, the predominant activity being buying tomatoes in bulk from Chwele and then reselling them to vendors and individual families in Myanga.<p>On a market day, which occurs twice a week, Rita sells about 4 crates of tomatoes at a profit of 300 Kenya Schillings each (about 4.6 US Dollars).  Vendors place their orders beforehand, and then Rita buys from her supplier accordingly. On non-market days Rita sells mostly retail, and can make a profit of about 100 Kenya Schillings from all of her products.<p>One challenge that her business currently faces is that on market days, she has no tomatoes left over after selling to vendors. Consequently, she cannot meet the demand from individual families who wish to make purchases in smaller quantities. Rita hopes to address this obstacle with a Kiva loan, which she would invest in increasing her stock of tomatoes, as well as onions and fish.<p>Rita is confident that there would be demand to meet the increased stock from her loan. Her increased capacity would grow her profits, and help her face the challenge of raising  10 children. Her husband is retired from his job as a water engineer, so much of the burden falls on her.

With an initial SPBD loan, Rosalina launched an ice cream business.  Her main customers are the children from the local primary school, and they have turned into a loyal crowd.  She sells between 60 and 70 ice creams a week bringing in between ST 100 and 150 (about USD 40 \u2013 60) for her family.

She is committed to the SPBD program and says that she doesn\u2019t think she\u2019ll ever leave the program.  She has taken out four loans from SPBD and has an outstanding repayment record.  With her first loan, she started her business of designing and hand-printing fabrics.  She sold the hand-printed fabrics to her fellow villagers.  With her second and third loan, she expanded the business further.  Lastly, with her fourth loan, she set up a flea market business.  At her stall, she sells her own hand-printed fabrics as well as other villagers\u2019 handicrafts and retail items such as shoes.  Her recent loan request will go towards purchasing more merchandise for her stall as well as making some basic repairs to the house where she lives with her extended family.

was born in 1965. She is happily married with four children. She likes business, but it was difficult for her to raise her take-off capital and her husband was unable to give it to her. She became more frustrated when her sister died and left behind children. It was not easy to provide food for her own children and those of her sister. She joined GHAPE in 2001 and received a loan of $30 and started her firewood business and gave part of the money to the children to trade. With the training received from GHAPE, she was able to sell the firewood and repay her loan. After this experience she decided to take another loan of $80 to continue the same business. She was now buying in greater quantity. She has taken loans up to $280.

M. is a 43-year-old lady, and married with three children. She lives in Kitengela township near Athi - River one of the peri-urban towns of Nairobi. Ndumi also takes care of her younger sister aged 30 years who is HIV positive and is on anti-retroviral treatment. Ndumi also takes care of another sister who is asthmatic, and therefore cannot work effectively. Ndumi is also responsible for the upkeep of her sisters\u2019 children. True to her Christian calling, Ndumi devotes some of her free time visiting people who are HIV positive and the disadvantaged people in Kitengela Township. During such visits, she takes to them foodstuff and clothes. \r\n\r\nNdumi started her tailoring business in the year 1997. This was after she finished her tailoring course, which was conducted by the Singer company. Before that, she used to sell vegetables while at the same time making mandazi (a doughnut-like bun). Her mandazi\u2019s were well sought after because they were delicious and she cooked them in a clean environment. Through the sale of mandazi and vegetables she managed to raise Ksh 32,000 (USD 490). \r\n\r\nWith this money Ndumi bought a sewing machine and various types of tailoring materials. She then rented a stall in Kitengela where she is operating today. Due to the growing number of school-going children as a result of the government\u2019s offer of free P]primary education, Ndumi is always busy trying to keep up with the high demand of school uniforms.            \r\n\r\nNdumi is therefore kindly requesting for a loan of USD 775. Given this loan in kind in the form of cloth materials for her tailoring stall, Ndumi will be able to add on to her stock of school uniforms, sweaters, ties, socks, and badges of different primary schools that have given her a two year contract to supply school uniforms. Ndumi intends to repay the loan within 8-12 months."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":41061,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","use":"Purchase of sewing fabric","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitengela, Athi River","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":36,"posted_date":"2007-06-07T23:13:34Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":775,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ndumi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-06-22T04:02:04Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":775,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":96.88},{"due_date":"2007-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":96.88},{"due_date":"2007-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":96.88},{"due_date":"2007-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":96.88},{"due_date":"2007-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":96.88},{"due_date":"2007-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":96.88},{"due_date":"2008-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":96.88},{"due_date":"2008-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":96.84}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":96.88},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":96.88},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":96.88},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":96.88},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":96.88},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":96.88},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":96.88},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":96.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":97,"local_amount":97,"processed_date":"2007-08-17T09:20:07Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-17T10:07:55Z","rounded_local_amount":97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":43788,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":97,"local_amount":97,"processed_date":"2007-09-17T09:20:24Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-17T10:07:55Z","rounded_local_amount":97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":55765,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":97,"local_amount":97,"processed_date":"2007-10-17T09:20:48Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-17T10:07:55Z","rounded_local_amount":97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":68601,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":97,"local_amount":97,"processed_date":"2007-11-17T10:21:32Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-17T10:07:55Z","rounded_local_amount":97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":82732,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":97,"local_amount":97,"processed_date":"2007-12-17T10:23:39Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-17T10:07:55Z","rounded_local_amount":97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":98429,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":97,"local_amount":97,"processed_date":"2008-01-17T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-17T10:07:55Z","rounded_local_amount":97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":117119,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":97,"local_amount":97,"processed_date":"2008-02-17T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-17T10:07:55Z","rounded_local_amount":97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":137107,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2008-03-17T10:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-17T10:07:55Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159877,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2007-06-08T04:02:04Z","paid_date":"2008-03-17T10:07:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":7,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":11535,"name":"Kayi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kayi M. was born in 1961 in Aklakou, which is still her home.

is a charming 31 year old lady, has two children and is separated from her husband. She lives in the town of Ruai in the outskirts of Nairobi. By natural instinct Susan started braiding her sister\u2019s hair when they were growing up. As time went by she became an expert in plaiting and braiding hair. A close friend of hers who was operating a salon suggested she learn how to apply chemical to clients\u2019 hair and also how to style hair. Her friend taught her the skills free of charge over a period of two years. Susan saved Ksh 5,000 (USD 76) while she was a member of a merry-go-round group in her village. From this money, she rented a stall for Ksh 2,000 (USD 30) in the year 2005. With the balance she bought a mirror for the stall and then started plaiting clients\u2019 hair since she did not have enough money to purchase salon equipment. Her friend Catherine Wambura then gave her a blow-dryer free of charge in order to support herself. Clients flocked her stall and by the end of the year 2005, from her small savings and proceedings from her business, Susan managed to buy a dryer. Today her salon is one of the most frequently visited salons in Ruai.

A. was born in 1969 in Anfoin and currently resides in Aklakou Fonkom\u00e9 with his wife and three children.  To deal with the needs of his family, he managed to open a cafeteria, where he offers quality service to his ever-growing customer base.  And importantly, with this source of revenue, he is able to feed his family.  Famous for the quality and flavor of his coffee, he has achieved all this through personal effort.  Living adjacent to the bus station in Aklakou, Mr. A. had been quick to realize that bus drivers need coffee even very late at night.  With much effort, he gathered a meager sum and then timidly began his business.  Today, after six years of experience, he would like to be able to handle rush hour demands, a challenge he faces daily.   To do so, he is requesting a loan of $1,000 to buy a stove, coffee cups, and other necessities to meet the expectations of his customers.  The more his revenues increase, the more his family's living conditions will improve.  \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from French by Daniel Kuey, Kiva volunteer:<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nN\u00e9 \u00e0 Anfoin en 1969, Monsieur A.

A. was born in Aklakou in 1968 and is married and the mother of four.  She came to selling fish by doing volunteer work for fishermen.  Each evening, she used to go and gather the fish that the fishermen had left.  She would smoke them.  Little by little, she developed an interest in selling smoked fish.  And then she invested her small income in a carton of frozen fish.  Once smoked, the fish were offered in front of her home.  Today, she is a great merchant, renowned by local consumers.  And so, the demand has gotten very good, but she lacks enough money to grown her business.  She is therefore requesting a loan of $1,000 to increase her production and to meet customer expectations.  That is how she will succeed in improving her family's living conditions.  \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from French by Daniel Kuey, Kiva volunteer:<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\r\nMadame A.

Ana Lucrecia T.

Her house is in the first canton. She belongs to the female order of \u201cLa Benedicion\u201d. She\u2019s known as Lucky, and she thanks God for giving her her life, family and especially her children, despite living in a time of some much strife, problems, jealousies etc. <\/p>\r\n<p> She has to work incredibly hard, to allow one of her three sons to study, because she doesn\u2019t receive the least help from the fathers of her children. Unfortunately her first husband abandoned her leaving her with two children, and then she got together again with another partner, but he also lied and left her as well with two children, and neither of these two men provide any financial support. Despite these huge failures, she says \u2018I have managed to better myself little by little, because I have made huge efforts in order that my children have bread to eat.  I also am extremely grateful to my father, he is very angry and bothered by my affairs, but at the same time my father is my right hand and it\u2019s him who has most helped me.'<\/p>\r\n<p> Lucky\u2019s business is on one side of the Catholic Church of San Pedro Yepocapa.  It\u2019s a Restaurant.  She gets up at 3 am to prepare from the house, and to transport things to the site she has in the centre, which she opens at 4am.  Working together with her father, the two of them serve customers, because the inhabitants of Yepocapa are very early risers: they getup early to work in the countryside or to travel outside Yepocapa, and go to the caf\u00e9 to drink a mug of atol, coffee and bread or other snacks. From daybreak, they serve full breakfasts, then they prepare for tea-breaks \u2013 they sell to teachers, children and bus attendants.  Later they prepare lunches for their customers, and she finally closes by 3 or 4 in the afternoon.  The truth is that she works too many hours but as she says she is working for a very important cause, to allow all four of her children the opportunity to study and obtain satisfaction in this way.<\/p>\r\n<p> She is another of the very grateful clients of Friendship Bridge, for giving her the opportunity to join a Co-operative bank, she has already had both good and bad experiences when she had wanted to obtain a loan like that given to her by the institution, but other organisations have always refused her credit, because of negative information given to them by other people.  Now she is a Friendship Bridge client and up until now has been a model participant, paying her instalments punctually and doing very well within the group.<\/p>\r\n<p><b>Translated from the Spanish by Katy Long, Kiva Volunteer<\/b><\/p>\r\n<p>Ana Lucrecia T.

Rosa recounts that like all the community, she suffered as a child as well as in part of her adolescence, because her parents had few economic resources. In 1982 her family was severely affected by the armed conflict, and one of the hardest moments was the loss of her husband as of twelve years ago. Because of this, she was extremely upset and the difficult situation meant she was solely responsible for providing an income to maintain her family.  It was this situation that obliged her to fight for her children. <\/p> \r\n<p>Now, she is a traditional artisan, and one of her dreams is to achieve economic stability: for this reason she wants to continue fighting to have the opportunity to deliver her products directly to a market, whether it be in Guatemala or even better overseas.  She understands that currently the Guatemalan market and that of her own home town has some disadvantages: there is too much competition and this means that the products she makes have to be delivered at a lower price than she considers ideal. Thanks to Friendship Bridge, she has seized the opportunity to participate in the second cycle with the Women\u2019s group EBEN-EZER, she feels a lot of gratitude towards this groups, because if it had not been for this organisation, she wouldn\u2019t have had the opportunity and she considers them like part of her family who have offered her a lot of support.<\/p>\r\n<p><b>Translated from the Spanish by Katy Long, Kiva Volunteer<\/b><\/p>\r\nEn el a\u00f1o 1965 un 14 de septiembre, Nace la se\u00f1ora Rosa Marina ,M. en el municipio de san Juan Comalapa del Departemanto de Chimaltenango do\u00f1a Rosa cuenta que ella pues como toda persona sufre de ni\u00f1a ya que sus padres son de escasos recursos econ\u00f3micos, cuenta que tanto en su ni\u00f1ez y parte de su juventud sufri\u00f3.

She was forced to leave school at a very early age because of a lack of support and is now starting to produce and sell cakes. To do this she is using the funds earned from selling chilled water, something she did previously. Her production capacity in the beginning was limited to a few bowls of flour and two litres of vegetable oil. She is seeing the demand for her cakes increase and wants to expand her business by buying bags of wheat flour, drums of vegetable oil and firewood.
