Segundina continues planting, however, as she still has two young sons to put through school. \r\n\r\nSegundina raises cows, sheep, and chickens. She herself started her farm in a plot near her home. She uses what she earns selling animals to sustain her family until harvest time.\r\n\r\nThis is Segundina's fifth loan with Kiva partner MFP. She belongs to a community bank and she is committed to paying her installments on time. The loan she is requesting today will be invested in fertilizer for the next planting season. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Violeta Rubiani, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":407326,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Buying fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-10-16T06:40:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Segundina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1068.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751142,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-10-16T10:53:45Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":144778,"name":"Sofia Esperanza","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Esperanza es socia del Banco Comunal \u201cSe\u00f1or de Locumba\u201d del distrito de Yunguyo, Provincia de Yunguyo, Departamento de Puno;

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Mrs. Channy S. did not come to take a loan but her husband was, so he was presented in the picture instead. \nTwelve members in this group loans are end-of-term loans and the rest have monthly payment loans.

G., who lives in the village of Barangay Himaya, Hinigaran, Negros Occidental, is 50 years old. She is married to Mario G., who is presently working as an elected barangay (village) councilor and who is also a farmer and a team supervisor in a sugarcane plantation. The couple have seven children: their eldest daughter already has a family, and the six younger children are still studying.\r\n\r\nEven though Maria's husband has work and does odd jobs for additional income, the money he earns is still not enough to support the needs of seven children. Maria strives hard to help her husband earn additional income for the family and to sustain the educational needs of their children.\r\n\r\nTo help her husband, Maria started a fish-vending business, selling fish to households in her community and other neighboring villages. The income she earned went mostly to the support of her children's education. In 2003, when she wanted to expand her business, she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon so that she could borrow additional capital without putting up any collateral.\r\n\r\nBecause of her good credit performance, Maria was able to get incrementally bigger loans over the next loan cycles. From the loans and from her increased income, she was able to put up a \"sari-sari\" or general store and have another source of income. As she continued borrowing and paying off her loans at NWTF-Project Dungganon without any delays, her business ventures have gradually stabilized and now earn a monthly net income of PHP 3,000 for her family.\r\n\r\nFor her previous loan, she borrowed Php 17,000 as additional working capital for her fish vending and general store businesses and the loan was fully paid on time without any delays in any of her her weekly payments. Now, for her 15th loan, she is borrowing the same amount of Php 17,000 for her two businesses. The income from this will, as usual, be be saved for her children\u2019s education.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few, but thousands of women.

Y., 39 years old, has been selling different foodstuffs (snacks, crackers, chips, and bottled drinks) on side streets for the last twenty years. Her husband, Rene, 41, is a fellow street-vendor. All their four children are in different school levels: the eldest is in college, the next is in high school, and the two youngest are in grade school.\r\n\r\nMelogin\u2019s place of business is situated in a bustling area \u2013 right at the foot of a commuter train station. Her business is going well because of its strategic location. She enjoys her business very much because commuters always need something to munch and drink and she\u2019s happy that she can provide what they need. She is now earning P28,000 a month.\r\n\r\nMelogin\u2019s small space always falls victim to frequent clearing operations done by the City Hall operatives. That\u2019s why she\u2019s been saving a lot so she could afford to have a permanent space for her business. She currently needs a loan of P21,000 for the expansion of her business.\r\n\r\nMelogin became a member of the Center for Community Transformation (CCT) Credit Cooperative only last year. What she likes most about her fellowship group is the level of trust and camaraderie amongst all the members.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Melogin hopes to see all her children finish their education.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About CCT<\/b>\r\nThe Center for Community Transformation (CCT) is an organized Christian response against poverty and social injustice. This is carried out through the fusion of social development initiatives and evangelical mission in a uniquely Filipino context. It serves urban and rural poor communities throughout the Philippines, in pursuit of its desire to see changed lives, strong families, and transformed communities centered in the Lordship of Jesus Christ.\r\n\r\nCCT is a member of the Five Talents family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":405514,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"To use as

She has a sari-sari (general) store and a play station where large video-karaoke machines and game consoles are for hire. With these businesses, Teresa makes a net monthly income of P14,000. She uses her profits to support the basic daily needs of the family, especially her children\u2019s education.\r\n\r\nUpon her friend\u2019s invitation, and out of curiosity, Teresa attended an orientation conducted for women entrepreneurs, sometime in 2008, by staff from the Center for Community Transformation (CCT) Credit Cooperative. She is now applying for a new loan in the amount of P10,000. which she will use to purchase more items to sell at her store. A portion of the loan proceeds will be used for her daughter\u2019s college education. She dreams of seeing her store someday grow as big as the city\u2019s supermarkets.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About CCT<\/b>\r\nThe Center for Community Transformation (CCT) is an organized Christian response against poverty and social injustice.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

M., is 67 years old and married to Jorge M., who is a retired hospital employee. Since Jorge receives a small pension from his former job, he now helps Florenda in her food-vending business so that they can earn a little more.\r\n\r\nThe couple have five children who are 34 to 43 years old, and have finished their training in their chosen fields: one is an electrician, another graduated from a nautical course, another finished a nursing course, and one is a midwife. One of her children works abroad and sends some money to help support the family; all the others are also gainfully employed and also help their parents in one way or another.\r\n\r\nBut Florenda and her husband Jorge do not want to be a financial burden to their children and want to retain some sort of independence. This is why they are striving hard to make their business a success in spite of their advanced age. Having a business also keeps them busy and alert.\r\n\r\nYears ago, Florenda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon to access capital so that she could help her husband increase the family income, especially so that they could afford the school tuition of their children. When she got her first loan of Php 5,000, she invested it by putting up a general store. As she was able to increase her loan amounts at each new cycle, she also expanded the operations of her general store and widened the line of products she offered to her customers. To earn a large amount, enough to pay for tuition fees, she also engaged in hog-raising and sold the pigs just in time to pay for the college tuition of her children.\r\n\r\nPatience, hard work and dedication to achieve her dreams is the key to Florenda\u2019s success, success in the sense that all of her children were able to finish college and earn their degrees. Now that her children are already gainfully employed and are starting to help her financially, she is taking things a little bit easier and is concentrating more on food-vending, selling sweet potato, cassava, bananas, bread and hotdogs from her home. She earns a monthly income of PHP 4,000 from this business activity.\r\n\r\nIn her previous loan, Florenda borrowed Php 16,000 as additional working capital for her business, and her loan was fully paid on time and in full, without any delays. Now, for her 11th loan, she is to borrowing Php 18,000 to be used to purchase ingredients for her food-vending business.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few, but thousands of women.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

M.'s Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is a cross section of the teachers from the Mathora Secondary School for Girls. The Mathora Secondary school is situated in Magburaka and is one of the oldest secondary schools in northern Sierra Leone. It is a boarding school and currently enrolls 930 pupils. Since its inception in 1959, several of the country\u2019s female dignitaries have passed through this school \u2013 ministers, lawyers, doctors, nurses, teachers, police officers and so on. Today, as a result of the new educational system being introduced by the Ministry of Education called the 6334 (i.e. six years in primary school, three years in Junior secondary school, three years in Senior secondary school and four years in university), the school is being divided into a senior and junior secondary schools with two principals running each one of the schools.\n\nIn 1998, the rebel invasion of the town of Magburaka left the school in ruins \u2013 buildings, staff quarters and dormitories were damaged. Laboratory equipment was destroyed, especially in the home economics and biology departments. Because of the invasion, the students and staff were forced to flee to Freetown to the Richard Allen High School, where they sought refuge until 2003.  After a peace treaty between the rebels and the government was reached in 2002, they were able to return to Magburaka.\n\nWith funds from the United Nations and the European Union, the once-mutilated school has been rehabilitated. UNICEF refurnished the laboratories with new equipment. The school is up-and-running once again, but the scar left by the rebels still remains \u2013 many of the teachers are not willing to return to the remote village of Mathora and a host of them have decided to remain in Freetown, where living conditions are bit better to that of the Mathora village. There are only a few who are willing to return and are determined to help the pupils of Magburaka and its environs.\n\nAdditionally, the teaching profession is one of the least preferred professions in Sierra Leone because salaries are not very attractive. Those who have found themselves in the profession usually are forced to seek other ways of earning more income to supplement their salaries. Many of them either engage in petty trading, in agriculture or in organizing extra classes (a practice the Sierra Leone government is trying to stop) in an effort to make additional money. \n\nSome of the teachers from Mathora have requested the loan for purposes of expanding their businesses.  Others will use their loans to give to their wives, who may already be businesswomen. It is out of their wives\u2019 businesses that they generate additional income and assist a great deal in the running of their respective households. Furthermore, some of the teachers will be using the loan for either a building project or in buying pieces of furniture \u2013 a piece of furniture which they would not normally be able to buy on their current salary. Finally, some will use their loan either to pay school fees and other related charges for their children or pursue further studies themselves.\n\nJohn M. B. (on the left) is a senior teacher at the school and head of this group. He has been a teacher for eighteen years. John was born in a place call Rotufunk, in southern Sierra Leone. He is forty-eight years old, married to a businesswoman and they have three children. One of their child is attending secondary school and the others are in primary schools. This is the third loan John and others in the group have received from SMT\/Kiva Lenders. With his first loan, he was able to pursue a masters degree coarse, with the second loan, he bought a piece of land. And with this loan, Mr. B. will use it to buy house building materials like iron corrugated zincs, iron robs and bags of cements.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2750,"image":{"id":407682,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction Supplies","sector":"Construction","use":"Buy house building materials like iron robs, corrugated iron zincs and cements","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Magburaka, Tonkolili","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"8.5 -11.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2009-10-16T11:00:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"John M.","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Augustine K.

Naimdjon is married. His wife is a homemaker and they have two children. He has always been a hard worker, someone who started at an early age helping his mother with her clothing business and contributing his earnings to the family from the time he was young. \r\n\r\nWhen Naimdjon married, his expenses increased and he had to strike out on his own to build a business that would support his own family. With the help of his father, he started his own clothing sales business and his wife helped him in her spare time. His business has grown little by little but he wants to continue to grow in order to improve his quality of life. \r\n\r\nNaimdjon is asking for a 5000 Somoni loan to buy inventory so that he can continue to increase his business. Naimdjon and his family are very grateful for the support you are providing to help them get ahead. \r\n\r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She hopes to replenish her diminished stock; it is for this that she is seeking a loan through WAGES (one of Kiva's field partners) to buy children's clothing and beauty products. She is unmarried and has no children.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Vilas Menon, Kiva

Mirzo was born in 1969 in the Kumsangir district, where he now works as a farmer. He is married and has six children. His main business is agriculture, which provides him with the means to meet the needs of his family. Mirzo owns a large piece of land where he cultivates different kinds of vegetables but due to the poor quality of the soil and the insects, he is no longer able to satisfy market demand. Very hard-working, he is asking for a loan of $2,800 to buy seeds, fertilizer, fuels and lubricants. The money he is requesting will help guarantee a high-quality harvest for which Mirzo and his entire family are very thankful.  \r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Rosalinda supplements her husband's income by raising pigs and vegetable farming.  She works hard to improve the living condition of her family, providing for all their basic needs, education and future security. \r\n\r\nIn January 2005, Rosalinda knew that the little she and her husband earned would not meet the needs of their child, so she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon so that she could borrow enough capital to start her general store. When she received her loan, she bought the most sellable products to sell in her store, and she reinvested the income into the business as revolving working capital. As her business continued to improve, she was also able to help advance her husband's business with some of her loans from NWTF-PD. Their combined monthly net income averages around PHP 13,000 and they invest most of it back into their respective businesses, after taking some out to cover their household expenses.\r\n\r\nIn her previous loan she borrowed Php 13,000 as additional capital for her general store. She paid back the loan in weekly installments and was able to fully pay it back within the loan term. Now she is borrowing PHP 10,000 for her eighth cycle loan, which she intends to use as additional capital for her general store and also to buy a pig to raise and sell after a few months. The income from this loan will be used for their household expenses, school expenses, and as capital for fish vending.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc., has answered the calling of not just a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day to surpassing realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable.

Because of her need to contribute to the household income, and motivated by herself, she launched her own general store with her 300.00 PEN loan. She obtained great results from the beginning because of her high-quality products, her reasonable prices, and her excellent customer service. She still runs this same business, which is located in her house. Her main customers are her neighbors. With this 1,600.00 PEN loan, she will purchase more products to stock her shop with rice and sugar by the kilo, crates of eggs, personal hygiene products, household cleaning supplies, crates of soft drinks, candy, and other products to keep her customers satisfied. She now feels very happy with the work and service that she provides, and she gives thanks to Manuela Ramos for giving support to people like her who want to work and get ahead in life.

All of the members are accomplished, and they are united among themselves.  They hold their meetings in Ruth Montegro\u2019s house.  She has been the president for two cycles.  Most of the members prepare and sell food, make bread, or sell cosmetics.  One member of the group is a man who, in addition to selling food, also manages sound and animation equipment.\r\n\r\nRuth Montegro is one of the founders of the communal bank.  She is married and has a daughter who goes to school.  She lives in a rented house with her husband who works in urban transportation.  She is president of the communal bank.  She sells empanadas, and, most of all, she sells ordered lunches to businesses and construction workers.  She now feels satisfied with the economic support she brings to her household.  She feels important, and she also saves and shares with her friends and neighbors who are part of the bank.\r\n\r\nCandelaria V. is a very responsible member who always arrives before the others and is the last to leave.  She makes bread in her house where she lives with her family.  Her daughters help her make the dough and bake the bread.  Soon, she would like to buy a larger oven and be able to set up her own store in her home.  She wants to do this to improve her earnings.  She knows that she is not very far from her goal because in her communal bank she has learned how to save money, be responsible, and to reach her objectives.\r\n\r\nAndres S. is a long-time member.  He has been with the group for three cycles.  He is an accomplished and responsible person.  He sells food with his wife.  On the week ends he works with his amplification equipment.  He uses the equipment when he is contracted to work on the week ends at parties.  He is proud to be part of a group of women who support each other and are accomplished.  In addition to be responsible with his own family, he helps his sister  raise his two nephews.  He works hard and is very happy to belong to this communal bank. \r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva
