He finished 10th grade but did not continue because of financial problems. He lives in his aunt and uncle's house and takes care of his mother and siblings, who live in Inhambane, by sending them 1,000 meticais every three months.\r\n\r\nDaniel left Inhambane to move to Namaacha District with his brother, where he continued his studies. He quit school when he got a job as a driver for the Health Department because the work schedule has irregular shifts, depending mainly on how many emergencies come up in his sector. Daniel has been a permanent employee for four years and earns 4,401.69 meticais, which he uses for household expenses and his construction project. Aside from his salary, he earns 725 meticais hazard pay for each trip he makes for work. He has been able to save 1000 meticais in his bank account with the help of his wife, who is a nurse.\r\n\r\nHe has had a loan before from BIM and learned about Hluvuku through a friend who is a customer of this institution. This is Daniel's third loan with Hluvuku and his first with Kiva. He is asking for 20,000 meticais to buy construction material (cement and electrical materials) to install electricity in his house. The previous loans were for 7,000 and 10,000 meticais and were for his house.\r\n\r\nHe promises to make his payments on time so he can have more loans in the future. He intends to ask for more loans to finish building his house.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":485.16,"image":{"id":777874,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"to buy construction materials (cement and electrical materials).","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Namaacha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-25.970278 32.025556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":"2011-05-28T20:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Daniel Junior","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":20000,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2011-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2011-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2011-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2011-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2011-11-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2011-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2012-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2012-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2012-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2012-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2012-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2012-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.13}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":1111.11,"processed_date":"2011-06-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:18:45Z","rounded_local_amount":1113.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216529677,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":1111.11,"processed_date":"2011-07-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:00:47Z","rounded_local_amount":1113.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221697150,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":1111.11,"processed_date":"2011-08-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T09:32:31Z","rounded_local_amount":1113.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227066702,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":1111.11,"processed_date":"2011-09-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:24:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1113.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232827307,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":1111.11,"processed_date":"2011-10-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:34:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1113.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238639281,"comment":null},{"amount":133.89,"local_amount":3967.24,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-18T09:02:01Z","rounded_local_amount":3976.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":245019194,"comment":null},{"amount":106.75,"local_amount":3162.99,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-20T07:48:56Z","rounded_local_amount":3170.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257740406,"comment":null},{"amount":57.02,"local_amount":1689.4,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-20T07:49:36Z","rounded_local_amount":1693.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263354157,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-05-29T14:23:09Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":302151,"name":"Tum","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Tum is 54 years old and the father of four children who are single.

She is single and has two children who are 10 and 16 years old. They both go to school. Felicidade finished 9th grade but did not continue with school because of her pregnancy. She lives in a rented house with her children and takes care of her two stepmothers when she can.\r\n\r\nShe grew up with her 2 stepmothers because her mother abandoned her when she was a baby. Felicidade has never left the District. After her pregnancy she went to live with her husband; they are now separated. She managed to find a job as a Cleaning Assistant at the Secondary School in Namaacha. She works from 6:00 am until 2:00 pm, earning 2,600 meticais monthly which she uses for household expenses. She has been able to save 200 meticais in her bank account.\r\n\r\nFelicidade had a loan from BIM and then learned about Hluvuku through a co-worker who is also a customer of this institution. This is her second loan with Hluvuku. She is asking for 15,000 meticais, which she will use to buy construction materials (sand, blocks and cement) to continue building her house. The first loan of 10,000 meticais was for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nShe is confident that she will pay off the loan ahead of time so she can take out other loans.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is 48 and single.  She finished through the 12th grade and didn\u2019t enroll in higher education because of a lack of financial resources.  She doesn\u2019t have children because she is sterile.  She is responsible financially for her mother and nephew.\r\n\r\nShe left Inhambane because she had a scholarship in former Western Germany, where she received formal training as a typist.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She works in artistic metalworking, creating utensils and adornments out of precious metals and alloys - a solid mix of several metals. She has worked in this area for 25 years, inheriting the skill from father who has been practicing the craft all his life. Her father has his own workshop and jewelery store. Andrea takes advantage of this workshop to create her  handcrafted articles, so she must pay for the gas and oxygen used to work the metals.\r\n\r\nThis business is going very well for Andrea. She has quite a few frequent clients, including workers from the hospitals and medical centers. With this loan she will buy metals like gold and silver and pay for the gas and oxygen she uses in her father's workshop.\r\n\r\nHer goals are to have her own workshop and jewelery store to make and sell her products. Also she hopes to buy a van to move her merchandise and machinery. Along with this she also plans to begin work in another area that will allow her to generate more income. This will be the production and sale of meals for the lunches of some of the construction workers from her husband's workplace.\r\n\r\nAndrea lives with her mother and her husband and their three children - 18, 9, and 3 years old. Her dream is to provide a better quality of life for her children so they can be more comfortable. She also hopes to leave her business as an inheritance for her children.\r\n\r\nAndrea is pleased and grateful for the credit provided by Fondo Esperanza since it has allowed her to invest in her business.

It grew around the end of the 19th century as a traditional area of the city. Its main axis is Independence Avenue, the old route of the ancient Road of the Inca and the northern entrance to the city of Santiago. Given its abundant indigenous population the Indigenous Cultural Center of Chile is located here. Independencia also boasts of important historic constructions, including six historic monuments of Chile.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":778079,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":"buy metals like

Currently, Emilia only lives with her husband.  She tells us that she and her family have been growing and harvesting coffee for more than five years.  Emilia, her husband and her son look after the crops, watering them and applying fertilizers.  When the time comes to harvest the coffee, they provide work to some people in their community.  After harvesting, they sell the coffee.  Emilia tells us that they used to sell their coffee to a gentleman who owned a grinder but he closed down a couple of years ago and now they sell their produce within their own community and in some other nearby communities.  They sometimes sell coffee cherries (which is when the coffee is mature) and sometimes they sell the beans.\r\n\r\nEmilia needs this loan to invest in fertilizers for her crops.

It has important commercial activity and historically reminds us that the city\u2019s first airport was built there.\r\n\r\nIn her widowhood, Petrona has raised three children, who today range in age from 22 to 44, through business activities.  She started out selling sweets.  Then she went into beverage sales like soft drinks, chicha (corn based drink) and beer taking advantage of the already captive clientele she had.  She then added sales of miscellaneous merchandise like pants, jeans, sweaters and blouses.  As her business grew she equipped it with a cooler that makes it possible for her to sell her beverages ice cold in Barranquilla\u2019s hot climate.\r\n\r\nPetrona sees the opportunity to sell in larger volume so wants to start selling beer by the case to nearby businesses because lots of them run out of beverages on weekends and have to wait until the delivery trucks from the respective firms come by.

She is a single mother who has two dependent children.  They live together in an urban community, in San Jos\u00e9 district, in Lambayeque.  San Jos\u00e9 district is a fishing port.\r\n\r\nRocio has more than three years experience selling fresh fish in nearby towns.  She cleans the fish and moves them in large ice trays from the port to her place of sale.  The tools that she uses to carry out her business are very worn and, for that reason, Rocio has requested a loan for 1,000 Peruvian soles from Edpyme Alternativa that she will use to buy new ones.  Part of her loan money will also be used to repair the roof of her house.\r\n\r\nRocio is very grateful for this loan since buying new tools will help her to better present her products to her customers.  This will enable her to make more sales which will allow her to continue making repairs to her home.  Repairing her roof is only the first step in a series of repairs that Rocio has to make to her home in order to enjoy a better quality of life."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":267.35,"image":{"id":778259,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","use":"to buy utensils and repair her roof","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"San Jos\u00e9 - Lambayeque","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2011-06-03T21:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rocio Del Milagro","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":69.96},{"due_date":"2011-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":71.21},{"due_date":"2011-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":74.52},{"due_date":"2011-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":74.37},{"due_date":"2011-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":80.86},{"due_date":"2011-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2011-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":83.36},{"due_date":"2012-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":87.74},{"due_date":"2012-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":89.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":92.65},{"due_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":96.17},{"due_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":98.24}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.24},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.7},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.94},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.89},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.46},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.26},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.91},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.62},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.75},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.06},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":26.24,"local_amount":69.96,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:55:46Z","rounded_local_amount":72.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216489727,"comment":null},{"amount":26.7,"local_amount":71.21,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-19T07:43:41Z","rounded_local_amount":73.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":222205849,"comment":null},{"amount":27.94,"local_amount":74.52,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-16T08:03:52Z","rounded_local_amount":76.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227182607,"comment":null},{"amount":27.89,"local_amount":74.37,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:46:04Z","rounded_local_amount":76.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232779569,"comment":null},{"amount":30.33,"local_amount":80.86,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:46:27Z","rounded_local_amount":83.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238584120,"comment":null},{"amount":30.46,"local_amount":81.25,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:42:36Z","rounded_local_amount":83.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244542299,"comment":null},{"amount":31.26,"local_amount":83.36,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-02T09:05:50Z","rounded_local_amount":85.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250752847,"comment":null},{"amount":32.91,"local_amount":87.74,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-19T08:54:58Z","rounded_local_amount":90.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257394885,"comment":null},{"amount":33.62,"local_amount":89.67,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:10:53Z","rounded_local_amount":92.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263290335,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-06-04T00:11:33Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":302360,"name":"Domis Yaquelini","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Domis es una madre joven de 23 a\u00f1os de edad, ella vive con sus dos menores hijos en casa de su madre en una comunidad urbana en v\u00edas de desarrollo llamada Jos\u00e9 Leonardo Ortiz en Chiclayo.\n\nDomis es vendedora, ella cuenta con una bodega en la cual ofrece desde art\u00edculos de escritorio, prendas de vestir y accesorios hasta golosinas y bebidas.

He\u2019s married to Corina, 21, and they have a son, Sa\u00fal, 1.  They live together in their own house.  Rober works as a farmer.  He tills the soil where he plants cocoa beans, coffee and citrus fruit.  He has two hectares of land and he is well aware of how hard farming is since he\u2019s been doing it for five years.  During harvest time he hires day laborers that help him bring in the crops and to carry them a certain distance where they are then picked up by small trucks.  He feels very committed to his work because thanks to his daily effort he now enjoys seeing his plants be productive leading to good profits.  He also mentions that winter is not to his liking because that\u2019s when the largest number of insects abound damaging his crops.\r\n\r\nThis is his first loan with MFP and he hopes that you will be able to help him out financially so that he can improve more in his business each time.   He will use the requested loan to buy cocoa bean and coffee plants as well as buy more land to cultivate.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":330.54,"image":{"id":778453,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy coffee and cocoa bean plants as well as farmland.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-05-27T20:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rober ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":82.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":87.3},{"due_date":"2011-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":89.64},{"due_date":"2011-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":92.32},{"due_date":"2011-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":98.84},{"due_date":"2011-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":101.15},{"due_date":"2011-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":105.31},{"due_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":110.09},{"due_date":"2012-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":114.13},{"due_date":"2012-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":118.55}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.74},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.61},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.62},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.07},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.93},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.49},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.29},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.79},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.46}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":31,"local_amount":82.67,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:32:01Z","rounded_local_amount":85.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216550387,"comment":null},{"amount":32.74,"local_amount":87.3,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:13:19Z","rounded_local_amount":89.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221719063,"comment":null},{"amount":33.61,"local_amount":89.64,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:03Z","rounded_local_amount":92.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350528,"comment":null},{"amount":34.62,"local_amount":92.32,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:49:08Z","rounded_local_amount":95.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232851012,"comment":null},{"amount":37.07,"local_amount":98.84,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:57:35Z","rounded_local_amount":101.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238666172,"comment":null},{"amount":37.93,"local_amount":101.15,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:42:16Z","rounded_local_amount":104.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621295,"comment":null},{"amount":39.49,"local_amount":105.31,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:50:51Z","rounded_local_amount":108.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250835422,"comment":null},{"amount":41.29,"local_amount":110.09,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:18:27Z","rounded_local_amount":113.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245234,"comment":null},{"amount":42.79,"local_amount":114.13,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:32:40Z","rounded_local_amount":117.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263385354,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-05-27T20:24:01Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":302439,"name":"William","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or William tiene una microempresa de comercializaci\u00f3n de repuestos para abanicos, licuadoras, ollas a presi\u00f3n y art\u00edculos de segunda, tambi\u00e9n presta el servicio de reparaci\u00f3n de  electrodom\u00e9sticos menores. \u00c9l  inicio como ayudante de su cu\u00f1ado que ten\u00eda ese tipo de negocio y desde all\u00ed aprendi\u00f3 el oficio,  para luego  independizarse y tener su propio taller en un lugar poco comercial del municipio de Galapa; desde  hace dos a\u00f1os logr\u00f3 negociar con su cu\u00f1ado en un punto comercial    donde le ha ido muy bien, su clientela ha crecido y tiene una gran variedad de repuestos.

All that knowledge was very helpful because thanks to it he was able, in time, to become independent from his parents.  Since five years ago he\u2019s been farming for himself.

She tells us that the clothes are of good quality and economical so when she sets up her stand the clothes sell out very quickly.\r\n\r\nShe hopes that with this loan her business will progress because she wants to provide quality of life for her children and that they study a profession.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":777534,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy clothes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Tierra Blanca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-05-28T00:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Del Carmen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":5000,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":112.55,"local_amount":1250.6,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:22:04Z","rounded_local_amount":1318.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211233892,"comment":null},{"amount":112.45,"local_amount":1249.4,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:12:13Z","rounded_local_amount":1317.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216512734,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-19T07:47:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1317.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":222223380,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-16T08:10:04Z","rounded_local_amount":1317.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227201657,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-05-29T13:53:47Z","paid_date":"2011-09-16T08:10:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":4,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":302461,"name":"Rosalia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Rosalia vive en el estado de veracruz en el municipio de Tierra Blanca o mejor conocida como la novia del sol, la cual se caracteriza por ser una zona ganadera y sus abuandantes calores en verano  de hasta 54\u00b0c.

Cows are never raised for beef, but for their milk, from which curd (duy) and fresh cheese (paneer) are made. Jersey cows are the preferred breed for milking. On average, a dairy cow in Nepal will produce about 10 liters of milk each day. In the local market, a liter of milk sells for about USD .50. \r\n\r\nIn addition to producing milk, cows provide dung that is used in home construction and as fuel for fires, and it can be captured in methane storage tanks. The purchase of a dairy cow, made possible through a Kiva loan, is an investment that will repay itself many times over.  \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner microfinance institution, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007. Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women. In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.  \r\n\r\nFor more information about Patan BPW, visit our partner page and keep an eye out for new loans and borrower updates:\r\n BPW Partner Page     Join our lending team: BPW Lending Team.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":778568,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy a young milking cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NP","country":"Nepal","town":"SainbuBhaishepati","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"28 84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":62,"posted_date":"2011-05-28T14:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Januka","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NPR","disbursal_amount":20000,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":25,"local_amount":1667,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:46:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1810.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216573594,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":1666,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:25:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1809.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221743301,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":1667.01,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-01T08:18:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1810.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227594762,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":1666.99,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-20T08:13:31Z","rounded_local_amount":1810.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":233265708,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":1666,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-17T09:49:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1809.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238691502,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":1667.02,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T11:05:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1810.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244647867,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":1666.98,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T11:14:43Z","rounded_local_amount":1810.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250865000,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":1666,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-30T07:55:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1809.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257274984,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":1667.03,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-30T07:55:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1810.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263416450,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-05-28T14:18:32Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":302493,"name":"Enerio","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Enerio is from the village of Silucap, Liloy, Zamboanga del Norte.

She is married and has three children ages 23,  21 and 17.  \r\n\r\nIn 2001, she established  her cow raising business. Working seven days a week and five hours a day, she supports her family.  \r\n\r\nShe has already received and successfully repaid five loans from Patan BPW. She used her most recent loan to buy a young milk-giving cow.  \r\n\r\nIn the future, Niru plans to uplift the economic condition of her family. She thanks you for your support. \r\n\r\nDairy cows are an important source of nutrition and income in Nepal. Cows are never raised for beef, but for their milk, from which curd (duy) and fresh cheese (paneer) are made. Jersey cows are the preferred breed for milking. On average, a dairy cow in Nepal will produce about 10 liters of milk each day. In the local market, a liter of milk sells for about USD .50.  \r\n\r\nIn addition to producing milk, cows provide dung that is used in home construction and as fuel for fires. It can also be captured in methane storage tanks. The purchase of a dairy cow, made possible through a Kiva loan, is an investment that will repay itself many times over.  \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner microfinance institution, Patan Business and Professional Women.
