Raising kuku is a popular micro-business in Tanzania, especially amongst SELFINA clients. \"Kuku\" means chickens in Swahili, and raising them for sale is popular for a number of reasons. Firstly, they require little start-up capital. You can start with one or two, and either add to them as you go, or wait for them to multiply naturally! Secondly, they require little space, so sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. Thirdly, while they are growing they produce eggs, which can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income, or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein. \r\nBeatrice is requesting a loan of $US275 to increase the number of chicks in her business and to purchase additional feed.

It is said that Coca Cola\u00ae is one of the most recognized symbols in the world. And it\u2019s true. Even in the most remote villages in Africa, there is usually some kind of \u2018bar\u2019 selling Coke, Fanta, and Guiness.

All of which explains why selling soft drinks is such a popular venture, whether you\u2019re the CEO of Coca Cola Ltd. in the United States or a micro-entrepreneur in Tanzania! Additionally, Honesta\u2019s bar is a good spot to relax over a beer if you manage to finish work early on a Friday afternoon. It\u2019s the kind of place where you kick back on a plastic chair under a tree, with a local beer in hand, the aroma of roasting \u2018mishikaki\u2019  (kebabs made on an open fire) wafting around you, and talk to anyone and everyone who happens to wander by. \r\n<p>Honesta puts the $US300 per month that she earns from the store towards her family\u2019s needs and into the maintenance of her business. She is requesting a loan of $275 in order to purchase additional stocks of soda and beer. She intends to repay this loan in 12 months. With the profits from this loan, Honesta hopes to expand her soda shop cum bar in the future.\r\n\r\n<P>SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing.

from Tanzania! Asiah is a 40-year-old married woman with two children (ages nine and 16). She and her husband are also responsible for two more children under the age of 18 who are orphans related to the family. Asiah has two businesses: a photocopy shop and a beauty salon. She established the salon seven months ago and is already earning $US400 from the profits at the salon. Hair, hair and more hair! This is the place where you can buy long hair, short hair, curly hair, straight hair, red hair, blue hair, and then have it attached to your head, woven, cut, or braided, and made to look like your own. \r\n<p>Asiah is requesting a loan of $US275 to purchase necessary items such as hair products, wigs, and cosmetics for her salon. She hopes to pay back this loan in six months.\r\n\r\n<P>SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support hence the poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan \u2013 a process called a sale and leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client. The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":191140,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","use":"To buy additional beauty salon inventory","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-08-18T01:10:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Asiah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-01T16:16:30Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2008-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":55,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2008-10-01T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-12T07:17:26Z","rounded_local_amount":63690,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":344467,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":55,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2008-11-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:18:20Z","rounded_local_amount":63690,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347923,"comment":null},{"amount":55,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:05:06Z","rounded_local_amount":63690,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970497,"comment":null},{"amount":55,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:09:46Z","rounded_local_amount":63690,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886714,"comment":null},{"amount":55,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:00:01Z","rounded_local_amount":63690,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20435974,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-08-18T16:16:30Z","paid_date":"2009-03-16T21:00:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":60633,"name":"Kamchihon","description":{"languages":["ru"],"texts":{"ru":"Kamchihon A. lives in the Khuroson region of Tajikistan.

Agatha is a young Tanzanian entrepreneur; she is only 24 years old. She has established a store that sells traditional clothing worn by Tanzanian women, called kanga and vitenge. The kanga is a piece of printed cotton fabric, about 1.5m by 1m, often with a border (called pindo in Swahili) along all four sides , and a central part (called mji) that differs in design from the borders. It is printed using the silkscreen method with its pattern in frames. Kitenge (the Swahili plural is vitenge) is a cotton fabric with wax print applied by a rotary printing machine. Most often it is a multicolored, dark wax print on a lighter background. Kitenge is similar to the kanga, but of a thicker cloth and has edging on the long side only. Kitenge is also a communicating textile - the various colors, patterns, writings and symbols represent moods, feelings, cultures, and traditions of native African people. \r\nSales from Agatha\u2019s store enable her to earn approximately $US200 per month. She is requesting a loan of $US275 in order to purchase wholesale quantities of cloth that she can retail for a handsome profit. With these increased profits, she hopes to expand her business in the future.\r\n\r\n<P>SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support hence the poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan \u2013 a process called a sale and leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client. The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":191145,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To buy additional supplies in wholesale to boost her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-08-18T01:10:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Agatha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-02T00:10:46Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2008-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":28,"local_amount":30545.45,"processed_date":"2008-10-02T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-13T07:09:58Z","rounded_local_amount":32424,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":345766,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":27,"local_amount":29454.55,"processed_date":"2008-11-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:18:20Z","rounded_local_amount":31266,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347924,"comment":null},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:05:11Z","rounded_local_amount":31845,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970498,"comment":null},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:09:47Z","rounded_local_amount":31845,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886715,"comment":null},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:59:54Z","rounded_local_amount":31845,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20435975,"comment":null},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-03-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:53:02Z","rounded_local_amount":31845,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130275,"comment":null},{"amount":27.49,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:21:57Z","rounded_local_amount":31845,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027106,"comment":null},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-05-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:11:37Z","rounded_local_amount":31845,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613146,"comment":null},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T23:59:49Z","rounded_local_amount":31845,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010229,"comment":null},{"amount":27.51,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:36:54Z","rounded_local_amount":31845,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232540,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-08-19T00:10:46Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T18:36:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":60636,"name":"Tillomurod.","description":{"languages":["ru"],"texts":{"ru":"Tillomurod M. resides in the Khuroson region of Tajikistan.

Mary is a 40-year-old married woman with three children. She owns and operates a beauty salon that she just established four months ago. By working 13 hours a day for six days every week, she is already showing a monthly profit of $US200 from the salon! Hair, hair and more hair! This is the place where you can buy long hair, short hair, curly hair, straight hair, red hair, blue hair, and then have it attached to your head, woven, cut, or braided, and made to look like your own. \r\n<p>Mary is requesting a loan $US275 to buy additional supplies such as hair dryers and other hair products for her store, which will allow her to serve more customers and generate additional income.\r\n\r\n<P>SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support hence the poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan \u2013 a process called a sale and leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client.

Nengah Suciani mempunyai usaha membuat kerajinan yang terbuat dari bambu.

Similarly she caters for other events and festivals such as \u201cOdalan\u201d, \u201cOtonan\u201d, and \u201cNgaben\u201d.

The income generated by her husband is not sufficient to meet her family\u2019s needs. This has made Ni Ketut Manis diligent in her work towards producing one woven cloth each month. Ni Ketut Manis has become quite dependent on the income generated by creating these traditional woven pieces.  Ketut Manis has high hopes of getting a loan from the DINARI foundation (via the village\u2019s central institution), with which she can purchase equipment for weaving and various materials, including special thread out of which she can make better and more varied finished pieces. \r\n<p>Typically Ni Ketut Manis sells her finished products directly to the customers in the market. Money from the sale goes towards purchasing more thread. Ni Ketut Manis\u2019s initial outlay for her activity was as big as Rp.200,000 (~US $22) and her earnings amount to Rp.50,000 (~US $5) for each finished woven piece. Ni Ketut Manis\u2019s husband sometimes joins in to spin the thread which will be used to make new woven pieces. Although they live in a simple house, nevertheless Ni Ketut Manis is very happy with her small family in a home environment that is clean and pleasant. \r\n\r\n <p><b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Aarati, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nNi Ketut Manis adalah seorang pengrajin Tenun Tradisional yang cukup terkenal karena keunikan cara pembuatannya. Penghasilan suaminya yang  tidak mencukupi keperluan hidup keluarganya hal inilah yang membuat Ni Ketut Manis tekun dalam membuat tenunan sehingga setiap bulan bisa menghasilkan satu kain tenun. Membuat tenun tradisional ini sudah lama digelutinya sehingga Ni Ketut Manis sangat bergantung dengan penghasilan yang didapatinya dari membuat tenun. Besar harapan ketut manis untuk mendapatkan dana pinjaman dari yayasan Dinari yang disalurkan melalui lembaga didesanya untuk membeli peralatan tenun dan perlengkapan tenun seperti benang khusus untuk tenun lebih banyak lagi agar hasilnya lebih bagus dan lebih bervariasi.\r\n<p> Biasanya Ni Ketut Manis menjual hasil tenunannya langsung kepasar tempat langganannya, setelah itu uang hasil penjualan dibelikan benang lagi. Modal awal yang dikeluarkan Ni Ketut Manis sebesar Rp. 200.000.- dan keuntungan yang diperoleh Rp. 50.000.- untuk setiap kain tenun yang sudah jadi. Suami Ni Ketut Manis terkadang ikut membantu memintal benang yang akan dipakai untuk membuat kain tenun yang baru. Walau mereka tinggal dirumah yang sangat sederhana tetapi Ni Ketut Manis sangat bahagia dengan keluarga kecilnya dengan keadaan rumah yang asri dan bersih"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":191326,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","use":"To purchase weaving

In 1999, Mrs. Ngoai joined the TYM Fund and borrowed the first loan of 300,000VND (about 20USD) to invest in raising livestock. Besides livestock, she also invested in planting fruit trees to take advantage of her large garden. Currently, both her husband and she focus on planting fruit trees and raising livestock to increase their family's income. After 9 years, her family's economy has improved tremendously, and she is able to send all her children to school. This time, she would like to borrow 900USD to invest further in planting fruit trees and raising livestock. Her family's monthly income is 3,000,000VND (about 200USD).\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Vietnamese by P.

After marriage, her husband and she mainly focused on farming and raising livestock. In 2003, she joined the TYM Fund. Initially, she borrowed money to invest in raising livestock but the profit was not substantial. As an active and creative woman, she decided to use the subsequent loan to invest in a general store. She was willing to learn and obtain experiences in doing business so her general store has been expanding ever since. Currently, her general store has a wide range of goods, bringing her a stable source of income. Her monthly income of 3,000,000VND (about 200USD) allows her to improve her family's standard of living and take care of her children. This time, she would like to borrow 900USD to continue investing in her general store.\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Vietnamese by Pham Yen Thanh, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nCh\u1ecb D. n\u0103m nay 31 tu\u1ed5i, gia \u0111\u00ecnh ch\u1ecb c\u00f3 2 con \u0111ang tu\u1ed5i \u0111i h\u1ecdc.

Everyday Suasana, like the average villager has a limited income.  Her husband, a small businessman usually is unable to provide the family\u2019s expenses.  Made Susana decided to be more diligent in her pig farming with a loan from DINARI through the KIVA program.  With initial funding of Rp.600.000,- (about USD65) used to purchase 2 piglets for breeding.  Made Susana borrowed from DINARI to increase funding with the plan to purchase additional 3 larger piglets for breeding and the balance use to purchase livestock supplies.  This being the first loan from DINARI will hopefully with this support will add income from sale of pigs raised later.  Assisted with good training on pig breeding by the staff of DINARI is felt to provide great benefit for Made Susana.  It is hoped that the yield from the sale of the pigs will be able to improve the family\u2019s economic condition and thus save for the children\u2019s education in future.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Indonesian to English by Pheng Tan, Kiva volunteer.<\/b> <p>\r\n\r\nTinggal di pesisir kota tidak membuat Made Susana mengalami kehidupan selayaknya orang di kota. Suasana sehari-hari masih layaknya di pedesaan dengan mata penghasilan yang pas-pasan. Suaminya yang hanya seorang wiraswasta tidak sepenuhnya bisa menanggung semua kebutuhan keluarganya. Made Susana memutuskan lebih menekuni usahanya beternak babi dengan meminjam modal ke DINARI melalui program KIVA. Dengan modal awal Rp.600.000,- yang sudah dibelikannya 2 ekor bibit babi penggemukan, Made Susana meminjam ke DINARI untuk menambah modalnya dengan berencana akan dibelikan 3 ekor babi penggemukan yang lebih besar dan sisanya akan digunakan untuk membeli pakan ternaknya. Pinjaman ini merupakan pertama kalinya ke DINARI dan diharapkan dengan kerja sama ini akan menambah penghasilannya dari menjual babi-babi peliharaannya nanti. Dibantu dengan training tentang cara memelihara babi yang baik oleh staf DINARI dirasakan sangat memberikan manfaat yang besar bagi Made Susana. Diharapkan hasil penjualan babinya akan mampu mendongkrak ekonomi keluarganya dan bisa menabung untuk pendidikan anaknya yang masi kecil nanti"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":191391,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase piglets and supplies (membelei anak babi dan pakannya)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2008-08-18T12:30:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Made Susana Dewi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-01T17:56:03Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":5000000,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":833333.33},{"due_date":"2008-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":833333.33},{"due_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":833333.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":833333.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":833333.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":833333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":91.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":92,"local_amount":836363.64,"processed_date":"2008-10-08T01:53:37Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-29T07:08:49Z","rounded_local_amount":849097.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":351700,"comment":null},{"amount":91.33,"local_amount":830303.02,"processed_date":"2008-11-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-19T20:05:07Z","rounded_local_amount":842944.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5308541,"comment":null},{"amount":183.33,"local_amount":1666666.66,"processed_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T11:40:08Z","rounded_local_amount":1692041.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14849764,"comment":null},{"amount":183.34,"local_amount":1666666.68,"processed_date":"2009-03-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T17:44:43Z","rounded_local_amount":1692041.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27080601,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-08-18T17:56:03Z","paid_date":"2009-04-15T17:44:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":60767,"name":"Rose","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rose  is a 45-year-old widow with 2 children, ages 20 and 27.

Moreover with the tight economic condition deteriorating and her 2 children still young made Ayu Putu decide to be diligent in pig farming which has been a family tradition since generations.  Her husband\u2019s income as a farmer is felt to be not sufficient to provide for the family\u2019s expenses.  With the motivation to assist her husband Ayu Putu decided to borrow from DINARI through the KIVA program to increase her capital to fund her pig farming.  With the initial loan 4 breeding pigs Ayu once again purchase 5 pigs with the loan from DINARI.  Coincidentally, Ayu\u2019s pig pen are adequately permanent adequate to accommodate many pigs.  Ayu is very serious in the pig farming because income from the sale is large.  After 5 months of breeding usually result in income of Rp.500.000,- (about USD 54) each month.  This will definitely aid fulfilling the family\u2019s expenses.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Indonesian to English by Pheng Tan, Kiva volunteer.<\/b> <p>\r\n\r\nMeski masih berusia muda untuk seorang ibu rumah tangga, tidak membuat Ayu Putu bersantai-santai dengan kehidupannya. Apalagi dengan himpitan ekonomi yang semakin berat dan ditambah harus menghidupi kedua anaknya yang masih kecil-kecil membuat Ayu Putu memutuskan untuk menekuni usahanya sebagai peternak babi yang memang sudah digeluti oleh keluarganya secara turun temurun. Penghasilan suaminya yang seorang petani dirasa masih belum cukup memenuhi kebutuhan keluarganya. Dengan motivasi membantu suaminya inilah Ayu Putu memutuskan untuk meminjam ke DINARI melalui program KIVA sehingga modalnya akan bertambah untuk usaha ternak babinya. Dengan modal awal 4 ekor babi penggemukan Ayu kembali membeli 5 ekor lagi dengan menggunakan modal dari DINARI. Kebetulan kandang babi Ayu sudah cukup permanen sehingga mampu menampung banyak babi.

He currently needs a loan in the amount of US$ 500 to purchase a new meat grill in order to expand his business.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":191426,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase a new meat grill for the snack bar","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"LB","country":"Lebanon","town":"Tyre","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"33.833333 35.833333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":77,"posted_date":"2008-08-16T22:20:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abed","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-01T00:58:48Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2008-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2008-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2008-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2008-10-01T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-02T07:05:24Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":344393,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2008-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T20:05:08Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5283239,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2008-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T10:10:59Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9895533,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2009-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T09:33:32Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14818736,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:33:09Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20353980,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:23:40Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27041723,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T10:06:10Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35932155,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:37:26Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44387293,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T16:48:04Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52894082,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-08-18T00:58:48Z","paid_date":"2009-07-15T16:48:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":60796,"name":"Magreth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Magreth  is a single  woman with a one-year-old child.

They hope to make a monthly average profit of 7.500 FCFA which will be used to make the payments on the loan, to bolster their working capital, and to help cover family expenses. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":191439,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase of foodstuffs for re-sale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Segou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14 -6","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2008-09-06T21:30:38Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Binta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadiatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadiatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maramou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adiara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sanatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Minta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-20T22:52:03Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":225000,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2008-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2008-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2009-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2009-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":37500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":88,"local_amount":37714.29,"processed_date":"2008-10-21T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-22T07:19:12Z","rounded_local_amount":39065.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":367986,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":87,"local_amount":37285.71,"processed_date":"2008-11-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T02:41:17Z","rounded_local_amount":38621.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5350886,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2008-12-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:34:58Z","rounded_local_amount":38843.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9973949,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2009-01-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:29:20Z","rounded_local_amount":38843.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14889322,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:14:16Z","rounded_local_amount":38843.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20440117,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2009-03-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:10:34Z","rounded_local_amount":38843.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135486,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-09-06T22:52:03Z","paid_date":"2009-04-15T22:10:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":60806,"name":"Gisela","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gisela is a 27-year-old married woman with a 1-year-old child.

The women share professional ties, kinship, friendship and live in the same neighborhood. They primarily trade in condiments, grains, fresh cow\u2019s milk, pagnes (lengths of brightly-colored African cloth), and firewood.  Some aspects of their business are of a daily variety, as in milk, while others are seasonal (grains, wood and condiments, et cetera). To meet the ever-increasing customer demand, they decided to join the loan program at the Soro Yiriwaso microfinance institution, which has granted them three group loans, all repaid in full.<p>\r\n\r\nThe women in the group often replenish their stock of coarse grains and fresh cow\u2019s milk locally in Zogofina, but at times go to the neighboring villages of Zenguela and Soignebougou for firewood, and to the regional capital of S\u00e9gou for condiments, pagnes and rice. With this loan they expect to buy 50 liters of fresh cow\u2019s milk (20 liters per day), 150 kilograms of coarse grains and pulses (millet, peanuts, beans, et cetera), 4 cartloads of firewood, 10 lengths of quality pagne and 300 kilograms of spices and rice.<p>\r\n\r\nProducts are then generally sold retail for cash or credit on market day at the village square, or both during the day and in the evening from home.  Their customers generally consist of women and men coming from other villages to make their purchases in Zogofina.

Having known each other for about a decade tied by professional, familial, and marital relationships, these women sell farm produce, seasonings, firewood, and various other items. In their desire to grow their business, the members decided to participate in Soro Yiriwaso\u2019s credit program, which they have been doing for two years. They have already received three group loans, all of which have been properly repaid. With this new loan, they plan to buy 14 bags of peanuts, 16 loads of firewood, and a large quantity of seasonings. They stock up on seasonings at the big market in the city of S\u00e9gou (especially on market days) from people from Bamako et Sikasso, on peanuts from farmers from Konodimini, on firewood in villages with those who have wood-chopping permits (i.e.,  in Chola and in Bounoubougoula). The Sinignesigui group sells the items at their homes, traveling in the neighborhoods of the city of S\u00e9gou, and in neighboring village markets for cash or credit to a clientele that consists primarily of retailers and women. They hope to earn 26,000 CFA francs per month on average, which will be used to make loan payments, the rest of which will be invested in their business. \r\n<p> <b>Translated from French by Sherry W., Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nSinignesigui est un regroupement de quatre femmes du village de Zogofina de la pr\u00e9fecture de S\u00e9gou (quatri\u00e8me r\u00e9gion \u00e9conomique de la r\u00e9publique du Mali) qui ont une moyenne d\u2019\u00e2ge de 39 ans.

From a young age, she has been interested in earning an income with her mother, notably in selling wood coal, farm produce, fruits and vegetables, and various items. She\u2019s been doing this for 45 years. She stocks up in the villages of Gara and Katiena and sells her fruits at home and at the S\u00e9gou market everyday. She sells the most on Mondays, S\u00e9gou\u2019s market day. Her clientele consists mainly of women (who make fruit juices and non-alcoholic beverages), men, and children. She has been working with Soro Yiriwasao for three years. After having obtained 3 group loans with a local association, she is on her second individual loan. All of her previous loans were properly repaid. She plans to use this new loan to buy 25 bags of peanuts, 10 packets of candy, and 20 bags of <i>zaban<\/i> (a very popular exotic fruit). She foresees earning 30,000 CFA francs each month, which will be used to make loan payments and provide for her family; the rest will be invested back into her business.

This is a very common way to try to make money in Patzutzun. \r\n\r\nFor many of the members of this group, it is the first time they've received a loan through Friendship Bridge. They have ambitious plans such as: increasing the amount of products in their stores and using their land as economically as possible. The loan will enable them to buy better seeds at lower costs. By using the credit to buy in bulk, the women who buy and sell vegetables will be able to buy at lower prices and thus be able to make more profit.\r\n\r\nCrecencia tells me their children all go to school, but need more supplies to be able to study well. The lacking pencils, paper, and schoolbooks are something she wants to provide them with first. When she is able to buy more, she really wants to buy them better school uniforms. The uniforms they wear now were bought for other family members and don't fit very well. The others agree, it is their biggest wish that their children have a chance at a better future!\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2025,"image":{"id":191593,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"invest

The living circumstances are not very good. The houses are not well equipped and often lack running water. Therefore they talk a lot about how to improve their lives. One of the members of this group once heard of micro-finance and started searching for a way to arrange this for them. They contacted Friendship Bridge and after a successful first loan, this is going to be their second loan now.\r\n\r\nThe women of this group have daily food stores and raise cattle. One of them also has chickens, and Rosa S. buys and sells candles. The president of the Group is called Clavia, who buys corn in Solol\u00e1. She takes this to Patzutzun to sell to all her friends, family, and neighbours. They all go to the local millers to have their corn ground into flour, to make their delicious tortillas. The fact that there is a miller in their village saves them a lot of work, not having to do the grinding by hand, says Clavia. \r\n\r\nMercedes, who is here with her daughter, will buy a new bull and all the necessities, such as food and fencing, to take care of him. When he is big and strong, she will sell him. It was Mercedes who initially started using credit this way. She has done it several times now. Her daughter Eusebia is going to follow her mom's example. This is a reasonably steady business, she tells me while holding the tiniest baby on her arm! When I ask them why they don't buy a cow to produce calves, they tell me that it is a very different business to raise young cattle. Cows are also not easy to find and much more expensive. And since working with the bulls is something they have a lot of experience with, their buyers already know the good quality of their bulls.\r\n\r\nRosa is a very good cook and people buy her tortillas as far away as Guatemala City! She runs her business with the help of her daughter. Her daughter makes the 2-3 hour journey a couple of times a week to sell her mother's tortillas. Maria is hoping to expand her store to be able to sell different products in the future. Next to her sits Antonia, who wants to do the same and eventually improve her home.  \r\n\r\nAntonia also wants to provide her children with their own bed and better school clothes. All her hard work is for one purpose only: to give her kids the best she can. And when I ask whether all the kids go to school they answer as one person: YES! \r\n\r\nAll of them are very determined to ensure their children will have better and more education than they had themselves.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3550,"image":{"id":191596,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

The calmness and quiet isn't helping their businesses to go well, says Carmen. Although the women in this group have all known each other for many years, they have never had the time to get to really know each other. Their hard work and many travels to different markets left them little time to socialize. \r\n\r\nWhen one of Cruz's brothers suggested forming a micro-finance group, she became the president of the group. Her business selling fruit helps her to meet new people so forming the group was not difficult at all. The group consists of people whose lands are next to each other: so-called vecinas (neighbours). And together with having some success after their first loan, they have gotten to know each other much better, says Paula. Her business in carrots and potatoes is better after her first loan. \r\n\r\nThey have their meetings at the office in Solol\u00e1. During the meeting they hand in their loan repayment and receive a non-formal education session. They have a lot of fun and there is a lot of laughing going on!\r\n\r\nWhere most of the women are working in buying and selling food, some of them sew traditional skirts and blouses. Isabel has her store right behind her house and she invested her first loan in big bags of frijoles (beans). When she sold these, she bought more, different kind of beans. Her customers like the diversity of her shop and buy more.\r\n\r\nWhen we talk about what their desires are, the women get very excited and start talking a lot in Kachiquel. After the loan officer's translation, I realise there is something they all work very hard for. The new gained self-esteem and better financial position allows them for the first time to dream. They want their children to do much better than they themselves were ever able to do.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3300,"image":{"id":191635,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

They have gotten to know each other very well, says Francisca. For this reason a solid base of trust has been formed, and this factor allows the women to work with a social collateral.  \r\n\r\nThe women of this group are mostly working in buying and selling foods. They carry their foods in baskets on their heads to the markets of Solol\u00e1 and Panajachel. Four of the women sew clothes and one of them is working in embroidery. There are two women who have chickens to sell at the markets, one is buying and selling beef, and there are the others who sell all kinds of fruits and vegetables such as carrots, corn, beans, and potatoes. Marta, the president of the group, will invest her share of the loan to buy avocado trees. When the trees are grown, she can harvest and sell the avocados. Santos tells me she also sells avocados and beans at the markets of Solol\u00e1 and Panajachel. Because of the different market days, she is able to go to both of the markets. \r\n\r\nFrancisca told me that none of the women went to school themselves, but they can say proudly that all of their kids are. Also, with the revenue they are getting back from their investments the ladies can fix up their houses; that is also great! The women of the group argue that the best thing about receiving a loan and investing it in their now profitable businesses is that they are creating opportunities they never had themselves for the ones they love most: their kids!\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2225,"image":{"id":191638,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

from Tanzania! Angelina is a forty-year-old married woman from Dar es Salaam with two children. She is an extremely enterprising woman who has crafted a successful business from selling vinyagos to tourists. A vinyago is a beautiful hand-crafted statue made from wood by members of the Makonde tribe, who hail from southeastern Tanzania. <P>Woodcarving is an important part of Makonde life, both in ancestor worship and in their own myth of creation. These statues have three main themes: traditional masks, motifs of female ancestor worship, as well as more abstract modern themes. <P>Anjelina buys these statues in bulk from the Makonde and retails them in Dar at a profit; her business earns her about US$ 200 in monthly profits. She is requesting a loan of US$ 625 as more capital to buy an increased supply of these traditional articrafts.\r\n\r\n<P>SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women.<P> Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets.

Every year she earns about 30,000,000 VND (equivalent to 1875 USD) from the fruit trees.  Currently, besides investing in the fruit trees, her family also invests in planting trained trees.

She soon realized that this investment brings good profit, so she continues to use her next loans to expand her business model.  Her business is doing very good.  Each year she sells about 2 tons of pork.  Mrs. H. uses her income to save and buy some valuable furniture for the house, such as a motorbike, a refrigerator, etc.  She is planning to invest in planting fruit trees.  Since she already has a large garden, this project is feasible, and it promises to bring good profit.  Mrs. H. has 3 children who have a job and a stable income, and one young kid who is still going to school.  This time Mrs. H. would like to borrow 9,000,000 VND (equivalent to 550 USD) to continue to invest in raising animals and farming.

She was only able to buy 2  billiard tables in the first cycle but with each cycle and more success she has been able to purchase one more table-tennis table.  Her family daily income is 200.000 NVD.  Apart from this, she also provide refreshments there.  In this cycle, she would like to borrow 10 million VND to continue to invest into this business.

She is 40 years old. She runs the store right in her house which has a good location and a street front so it is very suitable for her business. Her customers are the locals from the neighborhood. Her store offers lots of products because she invests a lot in her store. It has a good customer base. The income from the store is 150.000 VND a day. In the beginning of 2008, noticing that the customer demand had increased, she started to offer bottled water. This proved to be a good move as bottled water is safer for consumption than tap water. Customers had flocked to her store to buy bottled water. She has 3 children, 1 is already working to help the family and the other 2 are still going to school. Her husband is working with her. This round she is requesting a loan of 18.000.000 VND to continue investing in her store. Her family income is 5.000.000 VND a month.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Vietnamese by Khang Ho-Si, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nTham gia v\u00e0o Qu\u1ef9 n\u0103m 2002, ch\u1ecb Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb L. 40 tu\u1ed5i ngh\u1ec1 nghi\u1ec7p kinh doanh h\u00e0ng t\u1ea1p h\u00f3a.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. <P>Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support hence the poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. <P>When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan \u2013 a process called a sale and leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client. <P>The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":191803,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","use":"To purchase a hair dryer and other beauty products for her salon","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-08-29T19:10:22Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Khadija","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-12T23:47:15Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2008-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2008-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":30000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":28,"local_amount":30545.45,"processed_date":"2008-10-11T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-20T07:18:45Z","rounded_local_amount":32564,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356190,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":27,"local_amount":29454.55,"processed_date":"2008-11-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:18:28Z","rounded_local_amount":31401,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347932,"comment":null},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2008-12-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:08:55Z","rounded_local_amount":31982.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970506,"comment":null},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-01-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:13:19Z","rounded_local_amount":31982.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886723,"comment":null},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:15Z","rounded_local_amount":31982.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20435983,"comment":null},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-03-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:54:52Z","rounded_local_amount":31982.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130281,"comment":null},{"amount":27.49,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-04-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:23:07Z","rounded_local_amount":31982.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027112,"comment":null},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-05-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:12:47Z","rounded_local_amount":31982.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613152,"comment":null},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-06-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:00:59Z","rounded_local_amount":31982.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010235,"comment":null},{"amount":27.51,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-07-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:42Z","rounded_local_amount":31982.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232546,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-08-29T23:47:15Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":61025,"name":"Tran Thi","description":{"languages":["vi"],"texts":{"vi":"Ms \u0110\u00e0o  joined TYM fund in 2007.

This is fifty-year-old Zuhura S. from Dar es Salaam. She is married with three children and is also responsible for supporting two other young relatives because they are orphans. Zuhura owns a Mama Lishe or local caf\u00e9 in Dar where she serves up delicious local food. <P>When you see a SELFINA entrepreneur whose business title is \u2018restaurant\u2019 or \u2018caf\u00e9\u2019, you may have to adjust your mental image of what that is. A local restaurant or caf\u00e9 in Tanzania usually consists of a rough wooden table and some long, wooden benches, with the sky as a ceiling. Such places don\u2019t even appear in the Lonely Planet\u2019s budget guide, but if you\u2019re looking for a cheap and tasty meal, and someone to have a chat with, this is the place to be. <P>The food is all local; rice, ugali (a hot sticky dough, made from maize flour), plantain (a cooked savoury banana), all served with beans, vegetables, meat, and a variety of yummy sauces. <P>Josephine, along with one employee, also works as a caterer for local businesses, which has enabled her to increase her monthly profits to US$ 170. She has borrowed and successfully repaid two prior loans from SELFINA for US$ 275 each. This time, she is requesting a larger loan of US$ 525 to purchase additional cooking equipment to help fulfill her catering orders and buy extra cooking supplies on a larger scale. In the future, Zuhura hopes to do well enough to expand her business to another location.\r\n\r\n<P>SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. <P>Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support hence the poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. <P>When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan \u2013 a process called a sale and leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client. <P>The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":191808,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase additional catering and cooking supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-08-29T19:10:22Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zuhura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-12T21:59:18Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":600000,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2008-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2008-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2009-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2009-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2009-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2009-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2009-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2009-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2009-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":60000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":53,"local_amount":60571.43,"processed_date":"2008-10-11T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-20T07:18:46Z","rounded_local_amount":61639,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356191,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":52,"local_amount":59428.57,"processed_date":"2008-11-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:18:29Z","rounded_local_amount":60476,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347933,"comment":null},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2008-12-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:08:59Z","rounded_local_amount":61057.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970507,"comment":null},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2009-01-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:13:20Z","rounded_local_amount":61057.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886724,"comment":null},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2009-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:16Z","rounded_local_amount":61057.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20435984,"comment":null},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2009-03-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:54:53Z","rounded_local_amount":61057.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130282,"comment":null},{"amount":52.49,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2009-04-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:23:07Z","rounded_local_amount":61057.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027113,"comment":null},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2009-05-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:12:48Z","rounded_local_amount":61057.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613153,"comment":null},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2009-06-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:00:54Z","rounded_local_amount":61057.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010236,"comment":null},{"amount":52.51,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2009-07-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:43Z","rounded_local_amount":61057.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232547,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-08-29T21:59:18Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":61030,"name":"Hajra's Alfa Na Omega Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hajra K. is 25 years old.

This is thirty-eight-year-old Amina from Dar es Salaam; she is married and has four children. Amina runs a small stall from which she sells tomatoes in downtown Dar es Salaam. The Swahili word for this type of outside shop, or stall, is genge.<P> A genge is usually a very basic structure made of wood, with a tin roof, which sells general items such as onions, tomatoes, chilli, oil, rice, and dried fish. It is the kind of place local people send their children running to fetch something when they are in the middle of cooking the evening meal, and don\u2019t have time to go all the way to the market to buy the missing ingredient. <P>Amina started her stall in 2000 and has been earning monthly profits of US$ 150 from it since. This is Amina\u2019s second loan from SELFINA; she successfully repaid her first loan of US$ 275. She is now requesting US$ 625 in order to buy large quantities of tomatoes in bulk and to renovate her stall. Thank you for supporting Amina in her efforts to improve the volume and sales of her business!\r\n\r\n<P>SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. <P>Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support hence the poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. <P>When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan \u2013 a process called a sale and leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client. <P>The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":191811,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"To renovate her stall and to buy produce in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-08-30T01:10:20Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Amina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-13T04:38:25Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":700000,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":70000},{"due_date":"2008-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":70000},{"due_date":"2008-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":70000},{"due_date":"2009-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":70000},{"due_date":"2009-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":70000},{"due_date":"2009-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":70000},{"due_date":"2009-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":70000},{"due_date":"2009-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":70000},{"due_date":"2009-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":70000},{"due_date":"2009-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":70000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":63,"local_amount":70560,"processed_date":"2008-10-11T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-20T07:18:46Z","rounded_local_amount":73269,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356192,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":62,"local_amount":69440,"processed_date":"2008-11-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:18:31Z","rounded_local_amount":72106,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347934,"comment":null},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":70000,"processed_date":"2008-12-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:09:00Z","rounded_local_amount":72687.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970508,"comment":null},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":70000,"processed_date":"2009-01-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:13:23Z","rounded_local_amount":72687.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886725,"comment":null},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":70000,"processed_date":"2009-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:17Z","rounded_local_amount":72687.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20435985,"comment":null},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":70000,"processed_date":"2009-03-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:54:46Z","rounded_local_amount":72687.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130283,"comment":null},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":70000,"processed_date":"2009-04-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:23:08Z","rounded_local_amount":72687.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027114,"comment":null},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":70000,"processed_date":"2009-05-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:12:50Z","rounded_local_amount":72687.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613154,"comment":null},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":70000,"processed_date":"2009-06-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:00:56Z","rounded_local_amount":72687.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010237,"comment":null},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":70000,"processed_date":"2009-07-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:45Z","rounded_local_amount":72687.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232548,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-08-30T04:38:25Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":61033,"name":"Elsavar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elsavar was born in 1971.

This is forty-one-year-old Josephiner S. from Dar es Salaam. She is married with two children. Additionally, she cares for two relatives who board with her. Josephiner operates a Mama Lishe or local caf\u00e9 in the city where she serves up delicious traditional Tanzanian cuisine. <P>When you see a SELFINA entrepreneur whose business title is \u2018restaurant\u2019 or \u2018caf\u00e9\u2019, you may have to adjust your mental image of what that is. A local restaurant or caf\u00e9 in Tanzania usually consists of a rough wooden table and some long, wooden benches, with the sky as a ceiling. Such places don\u2019t even appear in the Lonely Planet\u2019s budget guide, but if you\u2019re looking for a cheap and tasty meal, and someone to have a chat with, this is the place to be. The food is all local; rice, ugali (a hot sticky dough, made from maize flour), plantain (a cooked savoury banana), all served with beans, vegetables, meat, and a variety of yummy sauces.<P> Josephiner, along with three employees, works long hours to earn monthly profits of US$ 170 from her business. This is her third loan with SELFINA. In the past, she has borrowed and successfully repaid loans of US$ 225 and US$ 425 each. This time, she is requesting a larger loan of US$ 625 to purchase additional cooking equipment and cooking supplies on a larger scale. In the future, Josephiner hopes to do well enough to open another business.\r\n\r\n<P>Josephiner is a perfect example of why microfinance works and why the large majority of clients repay their loans. A lot of people who hear about microfinance (or Kiva.org) for the first time, ask anxiously, \u201cBut how do you make sure people pay back? Won\u2019t they just take the money?\u201d The implication is that the clientele who access microfinance (usually 'the poor\u2019) are less trustworthy, efficient or educated than \u2018ordinary\u2019 people. <P>Whether or not this is true is somewhat irrelevant, for a number of reasons. Firstly, most MFIs have due diligence processes in place to assess client risk, as well as measures such as collateral arrangements and group lending (where a defaulted loan is borne by the group as a whole) to address this risk. More important than any of these deterrents, however, is an incentive. The incentive clients have to start a business, build a business, and repay their loan so that they can get another and another and another\u2026The incentive is having on-going access to financial services from which they had previously been excluded.\r\n\r\n<P>SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. <P>Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support hence the poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. <P>When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan \u2013 a process called a sale and leaseback arrangement.

She has a simple family which is why the family's income mainly comes from rearing livestock and farming. Before joining the Fund, the family focused their efforts on raising pigs for the lack of capital. After having received a loan, she assertively invested in cattle rearing. \r\n\r\nToday, the family is raising one cow to sell for its meat and another cow for breeding. The project of raising cattle has helped to gradually improve the family income. Outside of the time he puts in to help his wife tend to the livestock, Mrs. G\u00e1i's husband also works as a hired motorbike driver to increase the family income. \r\n\r\nMrs. G\u00e1i has always dreamt of having a more steady income to put money towards her two children's education and give her family a better life. She wishes to borrow 9,000,000 VND to purchase materials and supplies for her livestock rearing business.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by Catherine Tran, Kiva

After 10 years of membership, Mrs. Lap has been one of the members who use their loans effectively. This time, she would like to borrow 18,000,000VND (1,100USD) to continue investing in raising cows. Her monthly income is 4,000,000VND (about 266USD).\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Vietnamese by Pham Yen Thanh, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nCh\u1ecb L\u1eadp tham gia v\u00e0o Qu\u1ef9 t\u00ecnh th\u01b0\u01a1ng t\u1eeb n\u0103m 1998.

from Tanzania! This is forty-eight-year-old Yasinta from Dar es Salaam. She is divorced with four children under the age of eighteen. She also takes care of a fourteen-year-old relative who is an orphan because his parents passed away from HIV AIDS. <P>Yasinta owns a small \"duka\" or neighborhood shop in the city where she sells common household and grocery items. She established the store in 1996 and currently runs it with the help of her children to earn monthly profits of US$ 71. She is requesting a loan of US$ 875 in order to obtain capital to expand the range and quantity of products available at her store. \r\n\r\n<P>SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. <P>Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets.

Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client. <P>The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":191856,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","use":"To perform much needed maintenance on her taxi","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-08-30T01:10:20Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Matha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-13T02:18:09Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2008-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2008-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":30000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":28,"local_amount":30545.45,"processed_date":"2008-10-11T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-20T07:18:48Z","rounded_local_amount":32564,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356197,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":27,"local_amount":29454.55,"processed_date":"2008-11-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:18:36Z","rounded_local_amount":31401,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347939,"comment":null},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2008-12-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:08:51Z","rounded_local_amount":31982.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970513,"comment":null},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-01-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:13:19Z","rounded_local_amount":31982.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886730,"comment":null},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:24Z","rounded_local_amount":31982.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20435990,"comment":null},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-03-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:54:52Z","rounded_local_amount":31982.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130288,"comment":null},{"amount":27.49,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-04-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:23:07Z","rounded_local_amount":31982.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027119,"comment":null},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-05-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:12:49Z","rounded_local_amount":31982.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613159,"comment":null},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-06-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:00:55Z","rounded_local_amount":31982.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010242,"comment":null},{"amount":27.51,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-07-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:44Z","rounded_local_amount":31982.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232553,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-08-30T02:18:09Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":61069,"name":"Phamthi","description":{"languages":["vi"],"texts":{"vi":"Before joining the TYM Fund, Mrs. U. faced a lot of difficulties in doing business because her husband passed away and her 2 children were still going to school. In 2003, she joined the TYM Fund to borrow money. At first, she invested in raising chickens. However, later on, she realized that growing decorative plants brought more profits. Therefore, she decided to invest in growing plants. Because she has learned lots of experience from other people, she has a lot of customers. Currently, her 2 children are all grown-up. She and her children work on growing the plants to meet local people\u2019s needs. With an earning of 200 USD\/month, their living conditions have improved.

from Tanzania! This is thirty-year-old Salima from Dar es Salaam. She is married with four children under the age of fifteen. She is also financially responsible for another child who is a relative. Salima owns and runs a stall from which she sells essential grocery items. The Swahili word for this type of outside shop, or stall, is genge. <P>A genge is usually a very basic structure made of wood, with a tin roof, which sells general items such as onions, tomatoes, chilli, oil, rice, and dried fish. It is the kind of place local people send their children running to fetch something when they are in the middle of cooking the evening meal, and don\u2019t have time to go all the way to the market to buy the missing ingredient. <P>Additionally, Salima has capitalized on Dar es Salaam\u2019s proximity to the Indian Ocean and the fondness of its residents for fish to sell roasted fish at her genge. This helps her earn some extra income. She currently makes US$ 90 per month from sales at her genge. <P>Salima is requesting a loan of US$ 225 to purchase additional fish, cooking oil, and cooking fuel for her stall. She is hopeful that selling more fish will help her earn higher profits.\r\n\r\n\r\n<P>SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. <P>Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets.

This is twenty-five-year-old Rahabu from Dar es Salaam, who is married and has a toddler. She also takes care of a sixteen-year-old relative who is an orphan. Rahabu owns and, with the help of an employee, runs a small store from which she sells essential grocery items. The Swahili word for this type of outside shop, or stall, is genge. <P>A genge is usually a very basic structure made of wood, with a tin roof, which sells general items such as onions, tomatoes, chilli, oil, rice, and dried fish. It is the kind of place local people send their children running to fetch something when they are in the middle of cooking the evening meal, and don\u2019t have time to go all the way to the market to buy the missing ingredient. <P>This is Rahabu\u2019s second loan with SELFINA; she has already successfully paid off a loan of US$ 275.

A lot of people who hear about microfinance (or Kiva.org) for the first time, ask anxiously, \u201cBut how do you make sure people pay back? Won\u2019t they just take the money?\u201d The implication is that the clientele who access microfinance (usually 'the poor\u2019) are less trustworthy, efficient or educated than \u2018ordinary\u2019 people. <P>Whether or not this is true is somewhat irrelevant, for a number of reasons. Firstly, most MFIs have due diligence processes in place to assess client risk, as well as measures such as collateral arrangements and group lending (where a defaulted loan is borne by the group as a whole) to address this risk. More important than any of these deterrents, however, is an incentive. The incentive clients have to start a business, build a business, and repay their loan so that they can get another and another and another\u2026The incentive is having on-going access to financial services from which they had previously been excluded.\r\n\r\n<P>SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing.

Medelina is an innovative micro-entrepreneur who owns a groundnut stall in the city. Roasted groundnuts are extremely popular in Dar es Salaam, and Medelina is one of the many vendors who sell them on the roads here! <P>Since groundnuts are traditionally grown in Dodoma, the capital of Tanzania which is located in the centre of the country, Medelina currently makes US$ 160 from the sale of her nuts and is requesting a loan of US$ 525 for capital to enable her to organize a bulk delivery of groundnuts from Dodoma. She will then roast these at her stall and sell them for a profit to customers unable to resist the tantalizing aroma of these fresh nuts! <P>\r\n\r\nMedelina is a veteran customer of SELFINA\u2019s; this is her fourth loan with them.

Firstly, most MFIs have due diligence processes in place to assess client risk, as well as measures such as collateral arrangements and group lending (where a defaulted loan is borne by the group as a whole) to address this risk. <P>More important than any of these deterrents, however, is an incentive. The incentive clients have to start a business, build a business, and repay their loan so that they can get another and another and another\u2026The incentive is having on-going access to financial services from which they had previously been excluded.\r\n\r\n<P>SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing.

She does not need to spend time marketing and selling her products because a company has placed orders for her gloves.  In the years since she has been participating in the Fund and investing in buying fabric, her family\u2019s finances have improved gradually, but markedly.

Thi Nguyen, 32 years old, has been participating in the Fund since 2006. The family\u2019s finances are encountering many difficulties; her husband works as labor for hire and she stays home to take care of their young children and work the fields.  The farming work does not take up all her time, so she planned with her husband to join the Fund to start a home business and supplement the family\u2019s income.  The project she decided to invest in was making statues from plaster.  The work is not too arduous, but the profit is still relatively high.  In subsequent rounds of funding she always invested in buying more plaster.  Since she has been in the Fund and doing this trade, the family\u2019s finances have improved greatly, and she still has time to do farm work and take care of her children.  In this round of funding she is requesting 9,000,000 VND to buy more plaster.

Her husband, besides working in the fields, also work as labor for hire to bring in an income of 1,500,000 VND a month.
