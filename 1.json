This bussiness deals in the retail shop in the main village trading centre.\r\n<br><br>\r\nI (Moses Onyango, Kiva Country Director) did the stock taking in this shop, and the total amount of money in this shop both cash and in goods is 435,000 Ugandan shillings that is equivalent to $250.\r\n<br><br>\r\nGiven a loan of $500, They plan to increase the stock in their shop so that even the Items that they use not to sell can be included in the stock.\r\n<br><br>\r\nTheir shop is stratagically placed and they command a high number of customers.  Being faithful people to all, I believe that their bussiness will prosper.  Additionally Haggai attained business skills training with Village Enterprise Fund so he is capable of handling the loan money and refunding it well.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":256,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"Increasing retail store stock to include broader array of products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Soroti","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.583333 33.583333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":1,"posted_date":"2005-10-15T17:00:00Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Haggai","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2005-04-14T05:27:55Z","disbursal_currency":null,"disbursal_amount":500,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[],"scheduled_payments":[],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2005-12-04T13:38:58Z","settlement_date":"2006-10-24T04:58:04Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86,"comment":"This business has payed $50 towards the payement of loan refund.\r\nThis business is doing very well after putting the loan money into use.\r\nMore about this business will come soon in the next journal."},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2006-01-03T06:57:08Z","settlement_date":"2006-10-24T04:58:04Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":106,"comment":"The people of Uganda are very active in business thus buying and selling during Chrismas season.\r\nThis was a very great opportunity for this business to gain more profit to increase the stock and refund the loan money.\r\nThey have refunded $100."},{"amount":30,"local_amount":30,"processed_date":"2006-03-03T15:11:05Z","settlement_date":"2006-10-24T04:58:04Z","rounded_local_amount":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":134,"comment":"There was a general complaint from all the businesses that the campaigns of the resent presidential election affected the businesses very much.\r\nPeople lived in fear to do their normal activities as the government soldiers were deployed all over the villages all round Uganda.\r\nThe businesses are just picking up since the country has remain peaceful.\r\nFor this reason, this business has managed to make a payment of $30 for the loan refund.\r\nThe business opportunity is now high since all the people have gone back to their usual business.\r\nThanks alot for funding this business.\r\nMoses."},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2006-06-26T16:55:58Z","settlement_date":"2006-10-24T04:58:04Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":502,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2006-08-11T14:08:09Z","settlement_date":"2006-10-24T04:58:04Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":750,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2006-10-16T06:08:04Z","settlement_date":"2006-10-24T04:58:04Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":1564,"comment":null},{"amount":120,"local_amount":120,"processed_date":"2006-10-24T04:58:03Z","settlement_date":"2006-10-24T04:58:04Z","rounded_local_amount":120,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":1929,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2005-03-31T06:27:55Z","paid_date":"2006-10-24T04:58:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":10,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":102,"name":"Simon","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Simon O. is married and has 7 children.\r\n<br><br>\r\nSimon O. started a drug shop after selling 3 goats he had reared at home for three years.

By collecting dues of $0.20 per month from each member, the group began a rotating credit system, lending from $10 to $50 with 5% interest. They have continued this lending system, dropped the interest rate, and increased the membership dues to a dollar every 4 months. The total in the fund is about $1,200. The group has received and repaid a substantial loan from a federation of women's groups in their regional capital city of Saint Louis. <br \/><br \/>The group also owns large cooking utensils that it rents out to members of the village for parties and ceremonies, the profits of which go back into the fund. Either as a group or through small businesses of its members Femmes de Nder cultivates sweet potatoes, harvests and processes incenses that grows as bulbous roots of an indigenous grass, raises chickens, goats, and sheep; practices local crafts, engages in commerce between Mauritania and Senegal and operates small restaurants.

He is Acholi and is one of the many thousands of people who were forced to flee their homes in the North because of the war that has been going on for the last 20 years.  His family lives in an Internally Displaced People's camp in the outskirts of Kampala called the Acholi Quarter. Six months ago J. joined Life in Africa and has been an active member ever since.  He started as a bracelet maker in the Invisible Children Bracelet Project but his hard work and determination quickly earned him a promotion to a sanding processor. <br><br>\r\n\r\nHe has acquired a piece of land from the King of Buganda who has sympathy for the people of Acholi and who has set aside free land for them.  Knowing that the people of the Acholi quarter have to go long distances to look for water, he has a plan to install a water tap on his land. The current water sellers who bring water in to this hilltop area are charging five shillings per litre for water which makes it very hard for the people to purchase water for their needs.  With a water tap installed on his land, J. will be able to purchase water for only one shilling per litre and he plans on selling this water for a reduced rate of  3 shillings per litre to his community.  <br><br>\r\n\r\nNot only will this provide a steady income for his family needs, but it will also offer a valuable service to his community at a more affordable price than they can currently get. This will insure that he has a secure source of buyers for his water, and it is likely to have a great impact on those living in the Acholi quarters.<br><br>\r\n\r\nTo accomplish this project, J. is seeking a loan in the amount of shs. 800,000 ($475).  He es-timates that once he acquires this loan it will take approximately one week to have the water tap installed.  Below is his budget:<br><br>\r\n\r\n16 metal pipes @ 12000= each =192000=<br>\r\nconnection fee to national water=300000=<br>\r\nlabor charges & other expenses =200000=<br>\r\nbuilding of small house so that the tap can be locked to avoid theft =100000=<br>\r\nThe whole total is 792000=.<br><br>\r\n\r\nBased on his current income, J. will be able to repay this loan in 12 months.

Five years ago she was faced with the problem of earning enough money to support herself and her children.  As with many women in her situation, she turned to something she knew to try and earn money. She happened to know how to make good peanut butter and so she started her small business. Her main goal was to be self reliant and to serve her customers well while earning an income to support her children.<br><br>\r\n\r\nIn the beginning she used the age old method of grinding the nuts using a mortar and pestle.  This method worked but it was a very slow process and she found she was not able to make the peanut butter fast enough to earn adequate money. To remedy this, she carefully planned and saved to purchase a processing machine. This enabled her to process enough to meet the de-mands of her customers and her business grew.<br><br>\r\n\r\nBut her good business sense tells her that she can do more.  She now has the capability of pro-ducing large quantities but still must produce smaller batches because she has no way of storing it until it is sold.  This will require the purchase of a refrigerator which will allow her to always have a supply on hand and will also enable her to increase her number of customers. To accomplish this she is seeking a loan in the amount of 800,000us. This amount will purchase a refrigerator, additional packing materials needed and the necessary capital to expand her production.  \r\nBelow is her budget:<br><br>\r\n\r\n 800,000\/= LOAN BUDGET<br>\r\nFRIDGE 400,000=<br>\r\nPACKING MATERIALS 200,000=<br>\r\nADDITIONAL CAPITAL 200,000=<br>\r\nTOTAL 800,000=<br><br>\r\n\r\nBased on her current income, Grace will be able to repay the loan in 6 months.

In an effort to model a high standard of \r\nthe transparency we operating in Africa should uphold online, this \r\nrather long message contains details that are relevant to helping you \r\nunderstand what's already happened, and what's happening now in the Life in Africa community with regard to this \r\nissue. Rest assured, Kiva staff are aware of these issues and some have \r\npersonally met, face to face, a number of the personalities involved. We at LiA feel it's now high time to let you - our valued lenders - in on the sensitive nature of the challenges we've been dealing with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn September 2006, <b>some LiA community members<\/b> tasked to manage the loan program \r\nand the Invisible Children bracelet campaign <b>resigned amidst accusations of \r\nmismanagement<\/b> from other members in the Life in Africa community. In the process, which was painful but arguably very healthy for the community in important ways,  \r\na laptop was stolen that included the records for both programs, the WE Center \r\nwas closed for 2 weeks, and management of the invisible children project shifted \r\nto another site, taking 35 (of 80) Life in Africa members involved in the \r\nproject with them to be full time employees. Among the staff lost during all the disruption at that time included 4 of 7 people trained to process and manage LiA member loans. Those who were left with loans training were heaped with mountains of new community management responsibilities on their plates. Everything related to the loans program seemed upside down and got out of synch for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Most LiA borrowers experienced<\/b> a 1-3 month period after the September events \r\nwhen payments due to them from the Invisible Children bracelet project were \r\ndelayed. Many fell into <b>arrears on their loans<\/b> at that time. In most (but not \r\nall) of those cases, those arrears have now been paid up to date. However, in \r\nthe wake of September's disruption, the paper files for the loan program were \r\nalso left in disarray and the computerized records were gone. It took over 3 months \r\nfor David Ewaku, a Life in Africa Board Member, to reconstruct the records and \r\nget the partnerships with Kiva (esp. online) and Invisible Children somewhat \r\nback on track, so that <b>by January 2007 loan payments were coming in smoothly again<\/b>. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, part of why it took so long was that David fell very ill and has \r\nbeen in and out of <b>hospital<\/b> since November. By then, however, we had hired a recent MBA grad with experience in microfinance \r\nas full time accounts manager for the Life in Africa community. Yet another \r\ndisaster - the <b>new accounts manager<\/b> took over David's updated loan program records, and proceeded \r\nthrough <b>professional incompetence<\/b> to make a complete mess of them over the next 4 months. She \r\nresigned in mid-March 2007 after receiving a warning letter from the community operations team about her performance. \r\nWe now find ourselves consulting 3 different sources of information that are \r\nriddled with holes and mistakes in order to get an accurate picture of what our \r\nborrowers have actually paid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a recent telephone discussion with Kiva staff about the apparent arrears in our loan portfolio, and with me hosting meetings in my home and participating in an advisory team for organizing Kiva's forthcoming ground-truthing efforts in East Africa this past week, we at LiA have been feeling a very keen sense of urgency about updating our payments on the Kiva website. Luckily, the community has Grace - our star community leader\/borrower who is  \r\nfeatured in the PBS Frontline segment about Kiva. Over the past 2 years, she \r\nhas dedicated her heart and soul to uplifting Life in Africa's communities in \r\nboth Kampala and Gulu. Though she is no accountant, <b>Grace Ayaa has now committed herself to taking the LiA loan program's administrative challenges by the horns<\/b>. <br><br>Over the past 2 weeks Grace has been working with a small group of community \r\nmembers to figure out how to reconstruct the community's loan program records, so that more than \r\none person understands the process that's been used and everyone can agree on \r\nthe final updated report. I can see she is very determined to do this transparently and am grateful on \r\nbehalf of the LiA community to Grace for the leadership she's investing in \r\ngetting our payment and loan tracking system straight and systemized once and \r\nfor all.  In fact, she  had hoped to finish everything before leaving for a short trip to Gulu this \r\nmorning. Instead, <b>Grace and her group of committee members have asked me to appeal \r\ndirectly for lenders' patience<\/b>. They feel that getting this sorted out \r\nright means it should not be approached in haste - they need more time to talk to the borrowers one by one to compare their records & recollections with the office records to get an accurate final picture of where each member stands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\r\n<b><u>PLEASE NOTE:<\/u> To avoid that ALL of our members' online \r\nrecords are negatively affected any further by this internal administrative \r\ncrisis, we are today marking all scheduled member loan payments as paid up to \r\nthis month on the Kiva website. <\/b> The amount paid on each account has been determined by the Kiva bulk-payments  feature as the scheduled amount outstanding due to Kiva. Our community has, after all, guaranteed that \r\neach of these loans will be fully repaid to the lenders, regardless of each borrower's actual performance. Nonetheless, once we have all of this sorted out, we will update all of you (hopefully with next month's payments) on the accurate situation for your borrower with a link to the full \r\nand actual member repayment records for all loans guaranteed by the LiA \r\ncommunity in 2006. <b>In the cases where payments posted on Kiva were already up to date, I have posted a $1 payment to be able to alert all of our lenders to this message.<\/b> <br>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\nI humbly hope you can <b>forgive us at LiA for not communicating with lenders earlier about the challenges<\/b> we've faced in keeping the payments on Kiva accurately recorded, and thank you for your continued patience as the community works in good faith to get the mess sorted out.  It is likely Kiva will be sending a Kiva Fellow to work with us during the summer months, which - combined with the lessons we've already learned - will undoubtedly help us stay on a better track as we now begin raising loan funds for more members in both Kampala and Gulu. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, any <b>lenders with constructive support to offer, or with an interest in volunteering<\/b> with our microfinance program in Uganda, are most welcome to join us in dialogue at the Omidyar.net communuty and contact Grace Ayaa online at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.omidyar.net\/group\/lia\/\">http:\/\/www.omidyar.net\/group\/lia\/<\/a>.

In an effort to model a high standard of \r\nthe transparency we operating in Africa should uphold online, this \r\nrather long message contains details that are relevant to helping you \r\nunderstand what's already happened, and what's happening now in the Life in Africa community with regard to this \r\nissue. Rest assured, Kiva staff are aware of these issues and some have \r\npersonally met, face to face, a number of the personalities involved. We at LiA feel it's now high time to let you - our valued lenders - in on the sensitive nature of the challenges we've been dealing with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn September 2006, <b>some LiA community members<\/b> tasked to manage the loan program \r\nand the Invisible Children bracelet campaign <b>resigned amidst accusations of \r\nmismanagement<\/b> from other members in the Life in Africa community. In the process, which was painful but arguably very healthy for the community in important ways,  \r\na laptop was stolen that included the records for both programs, the WE Center \r\nwas closed for 2 weeks, and management of the invisible children project shifted \r\nto another site, taking 35 (of 80) Life in Africa members involved in the \r\nproject with them to be full time employees. Among the staff lost during all the disruption at that time included 4 of 7 people trained to process and manage LiA member loans. Those who were left with loans training were heaped with mountains of new community management responsibilities on their plates. Everything related to the loans program seemed upside down and got out of synch for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Most LiA borrowers experienced<\/b> a 1-3 month period after the September events \r\nwhen payments due to them from the Invisible Children bracelet project were \r\ndelayed. Many fell into <b>arrears on their loans<\/b> at that time. In most (but not \r\nall) of those cases, those arrears have now been paid up to date. However, in \r\nthe wake of September's disruption, the paper files for the loan program were \r\nalso left in disarray and the computerized records were gone. It took over 3 months \r\nfor David Ewaku, a Life in Africa Board Member, to reconstruct the records and \r\nget the partnerships with Kiva (esp. online) and Invisible Children somewhat \r\nback on track, so that <b>by January 2007 loan payments were coming in smoothly again<\/b>. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, part of why it took so long was that David fell very ill and has \r\nbeen in and out of <b>hospital<\/b> since November. By then, however, we had hired a recent MBA grad with experience in microfinance \r\nas full time accounts manager for the Life in Africa community. Yet another \r\ndisaster - the <b>new accounts manager<\/b> took over David's updated loan program records, and proceeded \r\nthrough <b>professional incompetence<\/b> to make a complete mess of them over the next 4 months. She \r\nresigned in mid-March 2007 after receiving a warning letter from the community operations team about her performance. \r\nWe now find ourselves consulting 3 different sources of information that are \r\nriddled with holes and mistakes in order to get an accurate picture of what our \r\nborrowers have actually paid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a recent telephone discussion with Kiva staff about the apparent arrears in our loan portfolio, and with me hosting meetings in my home and participating in an advisory team for organizing Kiva's forthcoming ground-truthing efforts in East Africa this past week, we at LiA have been feeling a very keen sense of urgency about updating our payments on the Kiva website. Luckily, the community has Grace - our star community leader\/borrower who is  \r\nfeatured in the PBS Frontline segment about Kiva. Over the past 2 years, she \r\nhas dedicated her heart and soul to uplifting Life in Africa's communities in \r\nboth Kampala and Gulu. Though she is no accountant, <b>Grace Ayaa has now committed herself to taking the LiA loan program's administrative challenges by the horns<\/b>. <br><br>Over the past 2 weeks Grace has been working with a small group of community \r\nmembers to figure out how to reconstruct the community's loan program records, so that more than \r\none person understands the process that's been used and everyone can agree on \r\nthe final updated report. I can see she is very determined to do this transparently and am grateful on \r\nbehalf of the LiA community to Grace for the leadership she's investing in \r\ngetting our payment and loan tracking system straight and systemized once and \r\nfor all.  In fact, she  had hoped to finish everything before leaving for a short trip to Gulu this \r\nmorning. Instead, <b>Grace and her group of committee members have asked me to appeal \r\ndirectly for lenders' patience<\/b>. They feel that getting this sorted out \r\nright means it should not be approached in haste - they need more time to talk to the borrowers one by one to compare their records & recollections with the office records to get an accurate final picture of where each member stands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\r\n<b><u>PLEASE NOTE:<\/u> To avoid that ALL of our members' online \r\nrecords are negatively affected any further by this internal administrative \r\ncrisis, we are today marking all scheduled member loan payments as paid up to \r\nthis month on the Kiva website. <\/b> The amount paid on each account has been determined by the Kiva bulk-payments  feature as the scheduled amount outstanding due to Kiva. Our community has, after all, guaranteed that \r\neach of these loans will be fully repaid to the lenders, regardless of each borrower's actual performance. Nonetheless, once we have all of this sorted out, we will update all of you (hopefully with next month's payments) on the accurate situation for your borrower with a link to the full \r\nand actual member repayment records for all loans guaranteed by the LiA \r\ncommunity in 2006. <b>In the cases where payments posted on Kiva were already up to date, I have posted a $1 payment to be able to alert all of our lenders to this message.<\/b> <br>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\nI humbly hope you can <b>forgive us at LiA for not communicating with lenders earlier about the challenges<\/b> we've faced in keeping the payments on Kiva accurately recorded, and thank you for your continued patience as the community works in good faith to get the mess sorted out.  It is likely Kiva will be sending a Kiva Fellow to work with us during the summer months, which - combined with the lessons we've already learned - will undoubtedly help us stay on a better track as we now begin raising loan funds for more members in both Kampala and Gulu. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, any <b>lenders with constructive support to offer, or with an interest in volunteering<\/b> with our microfinance program in Uganda, are most welcome to join us in dialogue at the Omidyar.net communuty and contact Grace Ayaa online at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.omidyar.net\/group\/lia\/\">http:\/\/www.omidyar.net\/group\/lia\/<\/a>.

In an effort to model a high standard of \r\nthe transparency we operating in Africa should uphold online, this \r\nrather long message contains details that are relevant to helping you \r\nunderstand what's already happened, and what's happening now in the Life in Africa community with regard to this \r\nissue. Rest assured, Kiva staff are aware of these issues and some have \r\npersonally met, face to face, a number of the personalities involved. We at LiA feel it's now high time to let you - our valued lenders - in on the sensitive nature of the challenges we've been dealing with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn September 2006, <b>some LiA community members<\/b> tasked to manage the loan program \r\nand the Invisible Children bracelet campaign <b>resigned amidst accusations of \r\nmismanagement<\/b> from other members in the Life in Africa community. In the process, which was painful but arguably very healthy for the community in important ways,  \r\na laptop was stolen that included the records for both programs, the WE Center \r\nwas closed for 2 weeks, and management of the invisible children project shifted \r\nto another site, taking 35 (of 80) Life in Africa members involved in the \r\nproject with them to be full time employees. Among the staff lost during all the disruption at that time included 4 of 7 people trained to process and manage LiA member loans. Those who were left with loans training were heaped with mountains of new community management responsibilities on their plates. Everything related to the loans program seemed upside down and got out of synch for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Most LiA borrowers experienced<\/b> a 1-3 month period after the September events \r\nwhen payments due to them from the Invisible Children bracelet project were \r\ndelayed. Many fell into <b>arrears on their loans<\/b> at that time. In most (but not \r\nall) of those cases, those arrears have now been paid up to date. However, in \r\nthe wake of September's disruption, the paper files for the loan program were \r\nalso left in disarray and the computerized records were gone. It took over 3 months \r\nfor David Ewaku, a Life in Africa Board Member, to reconstruct the records and \r\nget the partnerships with Kiva (esp. online) and Invisible Children somewhat \r\nback on track, so that <b>by January 2007 loan payments were coming in smoothly again<\/b>. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, part of why it took so long was that David fell very ill and has \r\nbeen in and out of <b>hospital<\/b> since November. By then, however, we had hired a recent MBA grad with experience in microfinance \r\nas full time accounts manager for the Life in Africa community. Yet another \r\ndisaster - the <b>new accounts manager<\/b> took over David's updated loan program records, and proceeded \r\nthrough <b>professional incompetence<\/b> to make a complete mess of them over the next 4 months. She \r\nresigned in mid-March 2007 after receiving a warning letter from the community operations team about her performance. \r\nWe now find ourselves consulting 3 different sources of information that are \r\nriddled with holes and mistakes in order to get an accurate picture of what our \r\nborrowers have actually paid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a recent telephone discussion with Kiva staff about the apparent arrears in our loan portfolio, and with me hosting meetings in my home and participating in an advisory team for organizing Kiva's forthcoming ground-truthing efforts in East Africa this past week, we at LiA have been feeling a very keen sense of urgency about updating our payments on the Kiva website. Luckily, the community has Grace - our star community leader\/borrower who is  \r\nfeatured in the PBS Frontline segment about Kiva. Over the past 2 years, she \r\nhas dedicated her heart and soul to uplifting Life in Africa's communities in \r\nboth Kampala and Gulu. Though she is no accountant, <b>Grace Ayaa has now committed herself to taking the LiA loan program's administrative challenges by the horns<\/b>. <br><br>Over the past 2 weeks Grace has been working with a small group of community \r\nmembers to figure out how to reconstruct the community's loan program records, so that more than \r\none person understands the process that's been used and everyone can agree on \r\nthe final updated report. I can see she is very determined to do this transparently and am grateful on \r\nbehalf of the LiA community to Grace for the leadership she's investing in \r\ngetting our payment and loan tracking system straight and systemized once and \r\nfor all.  In fact, she  had hoped to finish everything before leaving for a short trip to Gulu this \r\nmorning. Instead, <b>Grace and her group of committee members have asked me to appeal \r\ndirectly for lenders' patience<\/b>. They feel that getting this sorted out \r\nright means it should not be approached in haste - they need more time to talk to the borrowers one by one to compare their records & recollections with the office records to get an accurate final picture of where each member stands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\r\n<b><u>PLEASE NOTE:<\/u> To avoid that ALL of our members' online \r\nrecords are negatively affected any further by this internal administrative \r\ncrisis, we are today marking all scheduled member loan payments as paid up to \r\nthis month on the Kiva website. <\/b> The amount paid on each account has been determined by the Kiva bulk-payments  feature as the scheduled amount outstanding due to Kiva. Our community has, after all, guaranteed that \r\neach of these loans will be fully repaid to the lenders, regardless of each borrower's actual performance. Nonetheless, once we have all of this sorted out, we will update all of you (hopefully with next month's payments) on the accurate situation for your borrower with a link to the full \r\nand actual member repayment records for all loans guaranteed by the LiA \r\ncommunity in 2006. <b>In the cases where payments posted on Kiva were already up to date, I have posted a $1 payment to be able to alert all of our lenders to this message.<\/b> <br>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\nI humbly hope you can <b>forgive us at LiA for not communicating with lenders earlier about the challenges<\/b> we've faced in keeping the payments on Kiva accurately recorded, and thank you for your continued patience as the community works in good faith to get the mess sorted out.  It is likely Kiva will be sending a Kiva Fellow to work with us during the summer months, which - combined with the lessons we've already learned - will undoubtedly help us stay on a better track as we now begin raising loan funds for more members in both Kampala and Gulu. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, any <b>lenders with constructive support to offer, or with an interest in volunteering<\/b> with our microfinance program in Uganda, are most welcome to join us in dialogue at the Omidyar.net communuty and contact Grace Ayaa online at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.omidyar.net\/group\/lia\/\">http:\/\/www.omidyar.net\/group\/lia\/<\/a>.

In the process, which was painful but arguably very healthy for the community in important ways,  \r\na laptop was stolen that included the records for both programs, the WE Center \r\nwas closed for 2 weeks, and management of the invisible children project shifted \r\nto another site, taking 35 (of 80) Life in Africa members involved in the \r\nproject with them to be full time employees. Among the staff lost during all the disruption at that time included 4 of 7 people trained to process and manage LiA member loans. Those who were left with loans training were heaped with mountains of new community management responsibilities on their plates. Everything related to the loans program seemed upside down and got out of synch for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Most LiA borrowers experienced<\/b> a 1-3 month period after the September events \r\nwhen payments due to them from the Invisible Children bracelet project were \r\ndelayed. Many fell into <b>arrears on their loans<\/b> at that time. In most (but not \r\nall) of those cases, those arrears have now been paid up to date. However, in \r\nthe wake of September's disruption, the paper files for the loan program were \r\nalso left in disarray and the computerized records were gone. It took over 3 months \r\nfor David Ewaku, a Life in Africa Board Member, to reconstruct the records and \r\nget the partnerships with Kiva (esp. online) and Invisible Children somewhat \r\nback on track, so that <b>by January 2007 loan payments were coming in smoothly again<\/b>. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, part of why it took so long was that David fell very ill and has \r\nbeen in and out of <b>hospital<\/b> since November. By then, however, we had hired a recent MBA grad with experience in microfinance \r\nas full time accounts manager for the Life in Africa community. Yet another \r\ndisaster - the <b>new accounts manager<\/b> took over David's updated loan program records, and proceeded \r\nthrough <b>professional incompetence<\/b> to make a complete mess of them over the next 4 months. She \r\nresigned in mid-March 2007 after receiving a warning letter from the community operations team about her performance. \r\nWe now find ourselves consulting 3 different sources of information that are \r\nriddled with holes and mistakes in order to get an accurate picture of what our \r\nborrowers have actually paid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a recent telephone discussion with Kiva staff about the apparent arrears in our loan portfolio, and with me hosting meetings in my home and participating in an advisory team for organizing Kiva's forthcoming ground-truthing efforts in East Africa this past week, we at LiA have been feeling a very keen sense of urgency about updating our payments on the Kiva website, but the current state of the payment records is discouraging. Luckily, the community has Grace - our star community leader\/borrower who is  \r\nfeatured in the PBS Frontline segment about Kiva. Over the past 2 years, she \r\nhas dedicated her heart and soul to uplifting Life in Africa's communities in \r\nboth Kampala and Gulu. Though she is no accountant, <b>Grace Ayaa has now committed herself to taking the LiA loan program's administrative challenges by the horns<\/b>. <br><br>Over the past 2 weeks Grace has been working with a small group of community \r\nmembers to figure out how to reconstruct the community's loan program records, so that more than \r\none person understands the process that's been used and everyone can agree on \r\nthe final updated report. I can see she is very determined to do this transparently and am grateful on \r\nbehalf of the LiA community to Grace for the leadership she's investing in \r\ngetting our payment and loan tracking system straight and systemized once and \r\nfor all.  In fact, she  had hoped to finish everything before leaving for a short trip to Gulu this \r\nmorning. Instead, <b>Grace and her group of committee members have asked me to appeal \r\ndirectly for lenders' patience<\/b>. They feel that getting this sorted out \r\nright means it should not be approached in haste - they need more time to talk to the borrowers one by one to compare their records & recollections with the office records to get an accurate final picture of where each member stands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\r\n<b><u>PLEASE NOTE:<\/u> To avoid that ALL of our members' online \r\nrecords are negatively affected any further by this internal administrative \r\ncrisis, we are today marking all scheduled member loan payments as paid up to \r\nthis month on the Kiva website. <\/b> The amount paid on each account has been determined by the Kiva bulk-payments  feature as the scheduled amount outstanding due to Kiva. Our community has, after all, guaranteed that \r\neach of these loans will be fully repaid to the lenders, regardless of each borrower's actual performance. Nonetheless, once we have all of this sorted out, we will update all of you (hopefully with next month's payments) on the accurate situation for your borrower with a link to the full \r\nand actual member repayment records for all loans guaranteed by the LiA \r\ncommunity in 2006. <b>In the cases where payments posted on Kiva were already up to date, I have posted a $1 payment to be able to alert all of our lenders to this message.<\/b> <br>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\nI humbly hope you can <b>forgive us at LiA for not communicating with lenders earlier about the challenges<\/b> we've faced in keeping the payments on Kiva accurately recorded, and thank you for your continued patience as the community works in good faith to get the mess sorted out.  It is likely Kiva will be sending a Kiva Fellow to work with us during the summer months, which - combined with the lessons we've already learned - will undoubtedly help us stay on a better track as we now begin raising loan funds for more members in both Kampala and Gulu. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, any <b>lenders with constructive support to offer, or with an interest in volunteering<\/b> with our microfinance program in Uganda, are most welcome to join us in dialogue at the Omidyar.net communuty and contact Grace Ayaa online at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.omidyar.net\/group\/lia\/\">http:\/\/www.omidyar.net\/group\/lia\/<\/a>.

It took over 3 months \r\nfor David Ewaku, a Life in Africa Board Member, to reconstruct the records and \r\nget the partnerships with Kiva (esp. online) and Invisible Children somewhat \r\nback on track, so that <b>by January 2007 loan payments were coming in smoothly again<\/b>. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, part of why it took so long was that David fell very ill and has \r\nbeen in and out of <b>hospital<\/b> since November.

Yet another \r\ndisaster - the <b>new accounts manager<\/b> took over David's updated loan program records, and proceeded \r\nthrough <b>professional incompetence<\/b> to make a complete mess of them over the next 4 months.

Luckily, the community has Grace - our star community leader\/borrower who is  \r\nfeatured in the PBS Frontline segment about Kiva. Over the past 2 years, she \r\nhas dedicated her heart and soul to uplifting Life in Africa's communities in \r\nboth Kampala and Gulu. Though she is no accountant, <b>Grace Ayaa has now committed herself to taking the LiA loan program's administrative challenges by the horns<\/b>. <br><br>Over the past 2 weeks Grace has been working with a small group of community \r\nmembers to figure out how to reconstruct the community's loan program records, so that more than \r\none person understands the process that's been used and everyone can agree on \r\nthe final updated report. I can see she is very determined to do this transparently and am grateful on \r\nbehalf of the LiA community to Grace for the leadership she's investing in \r\ngetting our payment and loan tracking system straight and systemized once and \r\nfor all.  In fact, she  had hoped to finish everything before leaving for a short trip to Gulu this \r\nmorning. Instead, <b>Grace and her group of committee members have asked me to appeal \r\ndirectly for lenders' patience<\/b>.

In an effort to model a high standard of \r\nthe transparency we operating in Africa should uphold online, this \r\nrather long message contains details that are relevant to helping you \r\nunderstand what's already happened, and what's happening now in the Life in Africa community with regard to this \r\nissue. Rest assured, Kiva staff are aware of these issues and some have \r\npersonally met, face to face, a number of the personalities involved. We at LiA feel it's now high time to let you - our valued lenders - in on the sensitive nature of the challenges we've been dealing with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn September 2006, <b>some LiA community members<\/b> tasked to manage the loan program \r\nand the Invisible Children bracelet campaign <b>resigned amidst accusations of \r\nmismanagement<\/b> from other members in the Life in Africa community. In the process, which was painful but arguably very healthy for the community in important ways,  \r\na laptop was stolen that included the records for both programs, the WE Center \r\nwas closed for 2 weeks, and management of the invisible children project shifted \r\nto another site, taking 35 (of 80) Life in Africa members involved in the \r\nproject with them to be full time employees. Among the staff lost during all the disruption at that time included 4 of 7 people trained to process and manage LiA member loans. Those who were left with loans training were heaped with mountains of new community management responsibilities on their plates. Everything related to the loans program seemed upside down and got out of synch for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Most LiA borrowers experienced<\/b> a 1-3 month period after the September events \r\nwhen payments due to them from the Invisible Children bracelet project were \r\ndelayed. Many fell into <b>arrears on their loans<\/b> at that time. In most (but not \r\nall) of those cases, those arrears have now been paid up to date. However, in \r\nthe wake of September's disruption, the paper files for the loan program were \r\nalso left in disarray and the computerized records were gone. It took over 3 months \r\nfor David Ewaku, a Life in Africa Board Member, to reconstruct the records and \r\nget the partnerships with Kiva (esp. online) and Invisible Children somewhat \r\nback on track, so that <b>by January 2007 loan payments were coming in smoothly again<\/b>. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, part of why it took so long was that David fell very ill and has \r\nbeen in and out of <b>hospital<\/b> since November. By then, however, we had hired a recent MBA grad with experience in microfinance \r\nas full time accounts manager for the Life in Africa community. Yet another \r\ndisaster - the <b>new accounts manager<\/b> took over David's updated loan program records, and proceeded \r\nthrough <b>professional incompetence<\/b> to make a complete mess of them over the next 4 months. She \r\nresigned in mid-March 2007 after receiving a warning letter from the community operations team about her performance. \r\nWe now find ourselves consulting 3 different sources of information that are \r\nriddled with holes and mistakes in order to get an accurate picture of what our \r\nborrowers have actually paid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a recent telephone discussion with Kiva staff about the apparent arrears in our loan portfolio, and with me hosting meetings in my home and participating in an advisory team for organizing Kiva's forthcoming ground-truthing efforts in East Africa this past week, we at LiA have been feeling a very keen sense of urgency about updating our payments on the Kiva website, but the current state of the payment records is discouraging. Luckily, the community has Grace - our star community leader\/borrower who is  \r\nfeatured in the PBS Frontline segment about Kiva. Over the past 2 years, she \r\nhas dedicated her heart and soul to uplifting Life in Africa's communities in \r\nboth Kampala and Gulu. Though she is no accountant, <b>Grace Ayaa has now committed herself to taking the LiA loan program's administrative challenges by the horns<\/b>. <br><br>Over the past 2 weeks Grace has been working with a small group of community \r\nmembers to figure out how to reconstruct the community's loan program records, so that more than \r\none person understands the process that's been used and everyone can agree on \r\nthe final updated report. I can see she is very determined to do this transparently and am grateful on \r\nbehalf of the LiA community to Grace for the leadership she's investing in \r\ngetting our payment and loan tracking system straight and systemized once and \r\nfor all.  In fact, she  had hoped to finish everything before leaving for a short trip to Gulu this \r\nmorning. Instead, <b>Grace and her group of committee members have asked me to appeal \r\ndirectly for lenders' patience<\/b>. They feel that getting this sorted out \r\nright means it should not be approached in haste - they need more time to talk to the borrowers one by one to compare their records & recollections with the office records to get an accurate final picture of where each member stands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\r\n<b><u>PLEASE NOTE:<\/u> To avoid that ALL of our members' online \r\nrecords are negatively affected any further by this internal administrative \r\ncrisis, we are today marking all scheduled member loan payments as paid up to \r\nthis month on the Kiva website. <\/b> The amount paid on each account has been determined by the Kiva bulk-payments  feature as the scheduled amount outstanding due to Kiva. Our community has, after all, guaranteed that \r\neach of these loans will be fully repaid to the lenders, regardless of each borrower's actual performance. Nonetheless, once we have all of this sorted out, we will update all of you (hopefully with next month's payments) on the accurate situation for your borrower with a link to the full \r\nand actual member repayment records for all loans guaranteed by the LiA \r\ncommunity in 2006. <b>In the cases where payments posted on Kiva were already up to date, I have posted a $1 payment to be able to alert all of our lenders to this message.<\/b> <br>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\nI humbly hope you can <b>forgive us at LiA for not communicating with lenders earlier about the challenges<\/b> we've faced in keeping the payments on Kiva accurately recorded, and thank you for your continued patience as the community works in good faith to get the mess sorted out.  It is likely Kiva will be sending a Kiva Fellow to work with us during the summer months, which - combined with the lessons we've already learned - will undoubtedly help us stay on a better track as we now begin raising loan funds for more members in both Kampala and Gulu. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, any <b>lenders with constructive support to offer, or with an interest in volunteering<\/b> with our microfinance program in Uganda, are most welcome to join us in dialogue at the Omidyar.net communuty and contact Grace Ayaa online at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.omidyar.net\/group\/lia\/\">http:\/\/www.omidyar.net\/group\/lia\/<\/a>.

In an effort to model a high standard of \r\nthe transparency we operating in Africa should uphold online, this \r\nrather long message contains details that are relevant to helping you \r\nunderstand what's already happened, and what's happening now in the Life in Africa community with regard to this \r\nissue. Rest assured, Kiva staff are aware of these issues and some have \r\npersonally met, face to face, a number of the personalities involved. We at LiA feel it's now high time to let you - our valued lenders - in on the sensitive nature of the challenges we've been dealing with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn September 2006, <b>some LiA community members<\/b> tasked to manage the loan program \r\nand the Invisible Children bracelet campaign <b>resigned amidst accusations of \r\nmismanagement<\/b> from other members in the Life in Africa community. In the process, which was painful but arguably very healthy for the community in important ways,  \r\na laptop was stolen that included the records for both programs, the WE Center \r\nwas closed for 2 weeks, and management of the invisible children project shifted \r\nto another site, taking 35 (of 80) Life in Africa members involved in the \r\nproject with them to be full time employees. Among the staff lost during all the disruption at that time included 4 of 7 people trained to process and manage LiA member loans. Those who were left with loans training were heaped with mountains of new community management responsibilities on their plates. Everything related to the loans program seemed upside down and got out of synch for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Most LiA borrowers experienced<\/b> a 1-3 month period after the September events \r\nwhen payments due to them from the Invisible Children bracelet project were \r\ndelayed. Many fell into <b>arrears on their loans<\/b> at that time. In most (but not \r\nall) of those cases, those arrears have now been paid up to date. However, in \r\nthe wake of September's disruption, the paper files for the loan program were \r\nalso left in disarray and the computerized records were gone. It took over 3 months \r\nfor David Ewaku, a Life in Africa Board Member, to reconstruct the records and \r\nget the partnerships with Kiva (esp. online) and Invisible Children somewhat \r\nback on track, so that <b>by January 2007 loan payments were coming in smoothly again<\/b>. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, part of why it took so long was that David fell very ill and has \r\nbeen in and out of <b>hospital<\/b> since November. By then, however, we had hired a recent MBA grad with experience in microfinance \r\nas full time accounts manager for the Life in Africa community. Yet another \r\ndisaster - the <b>new accounts manager<\/b> took over David's updated loan program records, and proceeded \r\nthrough <b>professional incompetence<\/b> to make a complete mess of them over the next 4 months. She \r\nresigned in mid-March 2007 after receiving a warning letter from the community operations team about her performance. \r\nWe now find ourselves consulting 3 different sources of information that are \r\nriddled with holes and mistakes in order to get an accurate picture of what our \r\nborrowers have actually paid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a recent telephone discussion with Kiva staff about the apparent arrears in our loan portfolio, and with me hosting meetings in my home and participating in an advisory team for organizing Kiva's forthcoming ground-truthing efforts in East Africa this past week, we at LiA have been feeling a very keen sense of urgency about updating our payments on the Kiva website. Luckily, the community has Grace - our star community leader\/borrower who is  \r\nfeatured in the PBS Frontline segment about Kiva. Over the past 2 years, she \r\nhas dedicated her heart and soul to uplifting Life in Africa's communities in \r\nboth Kampala and Gulu. Though she is no accountant, <b>Grace Ayaa has now committed herself to taking the LiA loan program's administrative challenges by the horns<\/b>. <br><br>Over the past 2 weeks Grace has been working with a small group of community \r\nmembers to figure out how to reconstruct the community's loan program records, so that more than \r\none person understands the process that's been used and everyone can agree on \r\nthe final updated report. I can see she is very determined to do this transparently and am grateful on \r\nbehalf of the LiA community to Grace for the leadership she's investing in \r\ngetting our payment and loan tracking system straight and systemized once and \r\nfor all.  In fact, she  had hoped to finish everything before leaving for a short trip to Gulu this \r\nmorning. Instead, <b>Grace and her group of committee members have asked me to appeal \r\ndirectly for lenders' patience<\/b>.

In an effort to model a high standard of \r\nthe transparency we operating in Africa should uphold online, this \r\nrather long message contains details that are relevant to helping you \r\nunderstand what's already happened, and what's happening now in the Life in Africa community with regard to this \r\nissue. Rest assured, Kiva staff are aware of these issues and some have \r\npersonally met, face to face, a number of the personalities involved. We at LiA feel it's now high time to let you - our valued lenders - in on the sensitive nature of the challenges we've been dealing with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn September 2006, <b>some LiA community members<\/b> tasked to manage the loan program \r\nand the Invisible Children bracelet campaign <b>resigned amidst accusations of \r\nmismanagement<\/b> from other members in the Life in Africa community. In the process, which was painful but arguably very healthy for the community in important ways,  \r\na laptop was stolen that included the records for both programs, the WE Center \r\nwas closed for 2 weeks, and management of the invisible children project shifted \r\nto another site, taking 35 (of 80) Life in Africa members involved in the \r\nproject with them to be full time employees. Among the staff lost during all the disruption at that time included 4 of 7 people trained to process and manage LiA member loans. Those who were left with loans training were heaped with mountains of new community management responsibilities on their plates. Everything related to the loans program seemed upside down and got out of synch for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Most LiA borrowers experienced<\/b> a 1-3 month period after the September events \r\nwhen payments due to them from the Invisible Children bracelet project were \r\ndelayed. Many fell into <b>arrears on their loans<\/b> at that time. In most (but not \r\nall) of those cases, those arrears have now been paid up to date. However, in \r\nthe wake of September's disruption, the paper files for the loan program were \r\nalso left in disarray and the computerized records were gone. It took over 3 months \r\nfor David Ewaku, a Life in Africa Board Member, to reconstruct the records and \r\nget the partnerships with Kiva (esp. online) and Invisible Children somewhat \r\nback on track, so that <b>by January 2007 loan payments were coming in smoothly again<\/b>. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, part of why it took so long was that David fell very ill and has \r\nbeen in and out of <b>hospital<\/b> since November. By then, however, we had hired a recent MBA grad with experience in microfinance \r\nas full time accounts manager for the Life in Africa community. Yet another \r\ndisaster - the <b>new accounts manager<\/b> took over David's updated loan program records, and proceeded \r\nthrough <b>professional incompetence<\/b> to make a complete mess of them over the next 4 months. She \r\nresigned in mid-March 2007 after receiving a warning letter from the community operations team about her performance. \r\nWe now find ourselves consulting 3 different sources of information that are \r\nriddled with holes and mistakes in order to get an accurate picture of what our \r\nborrowers have actually paid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a recent telephone discussion with Kiva staff about the apparent arrears in our loan portfolio, and with me hosting meetings in my home and participating in an advisory team for organizing Kiva's forthcoming ground-truthing efforts in East Africa this past week, we at LiA have been feeling a very keen sense of urgency about updating our payments on the Kiva website. Luckily, the community has Grace - our star community leader\/borrower who is  \r\nfeatured in the PBS Frontline segment about Kiva. Over the past 2 years, she \r\nhas dedicated her heart and soul to uplifting Life in Africa's communities in \r\nboth Kampala and Gulu. Though she is no accountant, <b>Grace Ayaa has now committed herself to taking the LiA loan program's administrative challenges by the horns<\/b>. <br><br>Over the past 2 weeks Grace has been working with a small group of community \r\nmembers to figure out how to reconstruct the community's loan program records, so that more than \r\none person understands the process that's been used and everyone can agree on \r\nthe final updated report. I can see she is very determined to do this transparently and am grateful on \r\nbehalf of the LiA community to Grace for the leadership she's investing in \r\ngetting our payment and loan tracking system straight and systemized once and \r\nfor all.  In fact, she  had hoped to finish everything before leaving for a short trip to Gulu this \r\nmorning. Instead, <b>Grace and her group of committee members have asked me to appeal \r\ndirectly for lenders' patience<\/b>. They feel that getting this sorted out \r\nright means it should not be approached in haste - they need more time to talk to the borrowers one by one to compare their records & recollections with the office records to get an accurate final picture of where each member stands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\r\n<b><u>PLEASE NOTE:<\/u> To avoid that ALL of our members' online \r\nrecords are negatively affected any further by this internal administrative \r\ncrisis, we are today marking all scheduled member loan payments as paid up to \r\nthis month on the Kiva website. <\/b> The amount paid on each account has been determined by the Kiva bulk-payments  feature as the scheduled amount outstanding due to Kiva.

In the process, which was painful but arguably very healthy for the community in important ways,  \r\na laptop was stolen that included the records for both programs, the WE Center \r\nwas closed for 2 weeks, and management of the invisible children project shifted \r\nto another site, taking 35 (of 80) Life in Africa members involved in the \r\nproject with them to be full time employees. Among the staff lost during all the disruption at that time included 4 of 7 people trained to process and manage LiA member loans. Those who were left with loans training were heaped with mountains of new community management responsibilities on their plates. Everything related to the loans program seemed upside down and got out of synch for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Most LiA borrowers experienced<\/b> a 1-3 month period after the September events \r\nwhen payments due to them from the Invisible Children bracelet project were \r\ndelayed. Many fell into <b>arrears on their loans<\/b> at that time. In most (but not \r\nall) of those cases, those arrears have now been paid up to date. However, in \r\nthe wake of September's disruption, the paper files for the loan program were \r\nalso left in disarray and the computerized records were gone. It took over 3 months \r\nfor David Ewaku, a Life in Africa Board Member, to reconstruct the records and \r\nget the partnerships with Kiva (esp. online) and Invisible Children somewhat \r\nback on track, so that <b>by January 2007 loan payments were coming in smoothly again<\/b>. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, part of why it took so long was that David fell very ill and has \r\nbeen in and out of <b>hospital<\/b> since November. By then, however, we had hired a recent MBA grad with experience in microfinance \r\nas full time accounts manager for the Life in Africa community. Yet another \r\ndisaster - the <b>new accounts manager<\/b> took over David's updated loan program records, and proceeded \r\nthrough <b>professional incompetence<\/b> to make a complete mess of them over the next 4 months. She \r\nresigned in mid-March 2007 after receiving a warning letter from the community operations team about her performance. \r\nWe now find ourselves consulting 3 different sources of information that are \r\nriddled with holes and mistakes in order to get an accurate picture of what our \r\nborrowers have actually paid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a recent telephone discussion with Kiva staff about the apparent arrears in our loan portfolio, and with me hosting meetings in my home and participating in an advisory team for organizing Kiva's forthcoming ground-truthing efforts in East Africa this past week, we at LiA have been feeling a very keen sense of urgency about updating our payments on the Kiva website. Luckily, the community has Grace - our star community leader\/borrower who is  \r\nfeatured in the PBS Frontline segment about Kiva. Over the past 2 years, she \r\nhas dedicated her heart and soul to uplifting Life in Africa's communities in \r\nboth Kampala and Gulu. Though she is no accountant, <b>Grace Ayaa has now committed herself to taking the LiA loan program's administrative challenges by the horns<\/b>. <br><br>Over the past 2 weeks Grace has been working with a small group of community \r\nmembers to figure out how to reconstruct the community's loan program records, so that more than \r\none person understands the process that's been used and everyone can agree on \r\nthe final updated report. I can see she is very determined to do this transparently and am grateful on \r\nbehalf of the LiA community to Grace for the leadership she's investing in \r\ngetting our payment and loan tracking system straight and systemized once and \r\nfor all.  In fact, she  had hoped to finish everything before leaving for a short trip to Gulu this \r\nmorning. Instead, <b>Grace and her group of committee members have asked me to appeal \r\ndirectly for lenders' patience<\/b>. They feel that getting this sorted out \r\nright means it should not be approached in haste - they need more time to talk to the borrowers one by one to compare their records & recollections with the office records to get an accurate final picture of where each member stands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\r\n<b><u>PLEASE NOTE:<\/u> To avoid that ALL of our members' online \r\nrecords are negatively affected any further by this internal administrative \r\ncrisis, we are today marking all scheduled member loan payments as paid up to \r\nthis month on the Kiva website. <\/b> The amount paid on each account has been determined by the Kiva bulk-payments  feature as the scheduled amount outstanding due to Kiva. Our community has, after all, guaranteed that \r\neach of these loans will be fully repaid to the lenders, regardless of each borrower's actual performance. Nonetheless, once we have all of this sorted out, we will update all of you (hopefully with next month's payments) on the accurate situation for your borrower with a link to the full \r\nand actual member repayment records for all loans guaranteed by the LiA \r\ncommunity in 2006. <b>In the cases where payments posted on Kiva were already up to date, I have posted a $1 payment to be able to alert all of our lenders to this message.<\/b> <br>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\nI humbly hope you can <b>forgive us at LiA for not communicating with lenders earlier about the challenges<\/b> we've faced in keeping the payments on Kiva accurately recorded, and thank you for your continued patience as the community works in good faith to get the mess sorted out.  It is likely Kiva will be sending a Kiva Fellow to work with us during the summer months, which - combined with the lessons we've already learned - will undoubtedly help us stay on a better track as we now begin raising loan funds for more members in both Kampala and Gulu. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, any <b>lenders with constructive support to offer, or with an interest in volunteering<\/b> with our microfinance program in Uganda, are most welcome to join us in dialogue at the Omidyar.net communuty and contact Grace Ayaa online at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.omidyar.net\/group\/lia\/\">http:\/\/www.omidyar.net\/group\/lia\/<\/a>.

She joined in November of 2005 and currently works as a wire sorter for the Invisible Children Bracelet project. She is one of the younger members being only 20 years old. She is an orphan. Her parents died when she was only 8 leaving her and her two brothers alone.<\/p> <p>They were taken in by an aunt but life was very hard. The aunt, who was a widow herself, was taking care of many children and the grandmother who is blind. With very little money, food was often scarce and the only schooling Monica could afford was a tailor course. She did manage to get a job but could not earn enough money to exist on. Then she came to LiA. She now earns enough to help with food, rent, school fees for her brothers and support for her grandmother.<\/p> <p>With encouragement from her determined aunt, she is learning to be independent and to forget that she is an orphan. She has managed to save enough to set up a small shop. Her cousin runs the shop during the day while Monica works. Now she would like to do more. If she adds more stock to the shop, her profits will increase. She also plans to use her tailoring skills by purchasing a sewing machine. Since her shop has a big veranda, she will put this sewing machine there and use on the weekends to earn money. For this project she is seeking a loan of 800,000\/=.

Among the staff lost during all the disruption at that time included 4 of 7 people trained to process and manage LiA member loans. Those who were left with loans training were heaped with mountains of new community management responsibilities on their plates.

Among the staff lost during all the disruption at that time included 4 of 7 people trained to process and manage LiA member loans. Those who were left with loans training were heaped with mountains of new community management responsibilities on their plates. Everything related to the loans program seemed upside down and got out of synch for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Most LiA borrowers experienced<\/b> a 1-3 month period after the September events \r\nwhen payments due to them from the Invisible Children bracelet project were \r\ndelayed. Many fell into <b>arrears on their loans<\/b> at that time. In most (but not \r\nall) of those cases, those arrears have now been paid up to date. However, in \r\nthe wake of September's disruption, the paper files for the loan program were \r\nalso left in disarray and the computerized records were gone. It took over 3 months \r\nfor David Ewaku, a Life in Africa Board Member, to reconstruct the records and \r\nget the partnerships with Kiva (esp. online) and Invisible Children somewhat \r\nback on track, so that <b>by January 2007 loan payments were coming in smoothly again<\/b>. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, part of why it took so long was that David fell very ill and has \r\nbeen in and out of <b>hospital<\/b> since November. By then, however, we had hired a recent MBA grad with experience in microfinance \r\nas full time accounts manager for the Life in Africa community. Yet another \r\ndisaster - the <b>new accounts manager<\/b> took over David's updated loan program records, and proceeded \r\nthrough <b>professional incompetence<\/b> to make a complete mess of them over the next 4 months. She \r\nresigned in mid-March 2007 after receiving a warning letter from the community operations team about her performance. \r\nWe now find ourselves consulting 3 different sources of information that are \r\nriddled with holes and mistakes in order to get an accurate picture of what our \r\nborrowers have actually paid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a recent telephone discussion with Kiva staff about the apparent arrears in our loan portfolio, and with me hosting meetings in my home and participating in an advisory team for organizing Kiva's forthcoming ground-truthing efforts in East Africa this past week, we at LiA have been feeling a very keen sense of urgency about updating our payments on the Kiva website. Luckily, the community has Grace - our star community leader\/borrower who is  \r\nfeatured in the PBS Frontline segment about Kiva. Over the past 2 years, she \r\nhas dedicated her heart and soul to uplifting Life in Africa's communities in \r\nboth Kampala and Gulu. Though she is no accountant, <b>Grace Ayaa has now committed herself to taking the LiA loan program's administrative challenges by the horns<\/b>. <br><br>Over the past 2 weeks Grace has been working with a small group of community \r\nmembers to figure out how to reconstruct the community's loan program records, so that more than \r\none person understands the process that's been used and everyone can agree on \r\nthe final updated report. I can see she is very determined to do this transparently and am grateful on \r\nbehalf of the LiA community to Grace for the leadership she's investing in \r\ngetting our payment and loan tracking system straight and systemized once and \r\nfor all.  In fact, she  had hoped to finish everything before leaving for a short trip to Gulu this \r\nmorning. Instead, <b>Grace and her group of committee members have asked me to appeal \r\ndirectly for lenders' patience<\/b>. They feel that getting this sorted out \r\nright means it should not be approached in haste - they need more time to talk to the borrowers one by one to compare their records & recollections with the office records to get an accurate final picture of where each member stands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\r\n<b><u>PLEASE NOTE:<\/u> To avoid that ALL of our members' online \r\nrecords are negatively affected any further by this internal administrative \r\ncrisis, we are today marking all scheduled member loan payments as paid up to \r\nthis month on the Kiva website. <\/b> The amount paid on each account has been determined by the Kiva bulk-payments  feature as the scheduled amount outstanding due to Kiva. Our community has, after all, guaranteed that \r\neach of these loans will be fully repaid to the lenders, regardless of each borrower's actual performance. Nonetheless, once we have all of this sorted out, we will update all of you (hopefully with next month's payments) on the accurate situation for your borrower with a link to the full \r\nand actual member repayment records for all loans guaranteed by the LiA \r\ncommunity in 2006. <b>In the cases where payments posted on Kiva were already up to date, I have posted a $1 payment to be able to alert all of our lenders to this message.<\/b> <br>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\nI humbly hope you can <b>forgive us at LiA for not communicating with lenders earlier about the challenges<\/b> we've faced in keeping the payments on Kiva accurately recorded, and thank you for your continued patience as the community works in good faith to get the mess sorted out.  It is likely Kiva will be sending a Kiva Fellow to work with us during the summer months, which - combined with the lessons we've already learned - will undoubtedly help us stay on a better track as we now begin raising loan funds for more members in both Kampala and Gulu. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, any <b>lenders with constructive support to offer, or with an interest in volunteering<\/b> with our microfinance program in Uganda, are most welcome to join us in dialogue at the Omidyar.net communuty and contact Grace Ayaa online at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.omidyar.net\/group\/lia\/\">http:\/\/www.omidyar.net\/group\/lia\/<\/a>.

She will be able to provide the water at a less expensive rate and it will also benefit the community by shortening the distance they have to travel to get water. There has recently been another installation of a successful water tap but the quarters are very large and one tap will not fill the needs of so many people.

Everything related to the loans program seemed upside down and got out of synch for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Most LiA borrowers experienced<\/b> a 1-3 month period after the September events \r\nwhen payments due to them from the Invisible Children bracelet project were \r\ndelayed. Many fell into <b>arrears on their loans<\/b> at that time. In most (but not \r\nall) of those cases, those arrears have now been paid up to date. However, in \r\nthe wake of September's disruption, the paper files for the loan program were \r\nalso left in disarray and the computerized records were gone. It took over 3 months \r\nfor David Ewaku, a Life in Africa Board Member, to reconstruct the records and \r\nget the partnerships with Kiva (esp. online) and Invisible Children somewhat \r\nback on track, so that <b>by January 2007 loan payments were coming in smoothly again<\/b>. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, part of why it took so long was that David fell very ill and has \r\nbeen in and out of <b>hospital<\/b> since November. By then, however, we had hired a recent MBA grad with experience in microfinance \r\nas full time accounts manager for the Life in Africa community. Yet another \r\ndisaster - the <b>new accounts manager<\/b> took over David's updated loan program records, and proceeded \r\nthrough <b>professional incompetence<\/b> to make a complete mess of them over the next 4 months. She \r\nresigned in mid-March 2007 after receiving a warning letter from the community operations team about her performance. \r\nWe now find ourselves consulting 3 different sources of information that are \r\nriddled with holes and mistakes in order to get an accurate picture of what our \r\nborrowers have actually paid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a recent telephone discussion with Kiva staff about the apparent arrears in our loan portfolio, and with me hosting meetings in my home and participating in an advisory team for organizing Kiva's forthcoming ground-truthing efforts in East Africa this past week, we at LiA have been feeling a very keen sense of urgency about updating our payments on the Kiva website. Luckily, the community has Grace - our star community leader\/borrower who is  \r\nfeatured in the PBS Frontline segment about Kiva. Over the past 2 years, she \r\nhas dedicated her heart and soul to uplifting Life in Africa's communities in \r\nboth Kampala and Gulu. Though she is no accountant, <b>Grace Ayaa has now committed herself to taking the LiA loan program's administrative challenges by the horns<\/b>. <br><br>Over the past 2 weeks Grace has been working with a small group of community \r\nmembers to figure out how to reconstruct the community's loan program records, so that more than \r\none person understands the process that's been used and everyone can agree on \r\nthe final updated report. I can see she is very determined to do this transparently and am grateful on \r\nbehalf of the LiA community to Grace for the leadership she's investing in \r\ngetting our payment and loan tracking system straight and systemized once and \r\nfor all.  In fact, she  had hoped to finish everything before leaving for a short trip to Gulu this \r\nmorning. Instead, <b>Grace and her group of committee members have asked me to appeal \r\ndirectly for lenders' patience<\/b>.

Our community has, after all, guaranteed that \r\neach of these loans will be fully repaid to the lenders, regardless of each borrower's actual performance. Nonetheless, once we have all of this sorted out, we will update all of you (hopefully with next month's payments) on the accurate situation for your borrower with a link to the full \r\nand actual member repayment records for all loans guaranteed by the LiA \r\ncommunity in 2006. <b>In the cases where payments posted on Kiva were already up to date, I have posted a $1 payment to be able to alert all of our lenders to this message.<\/b> <br>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\nI humbly hope you can <b>forgive us at LiA for not communicating with lenders earlier about the challenges<\/b> we've faced in keeping the payments on Kiva accurately recorded, and thank you for your continued patience as the community works in good faith to get the mess sorted out.

Among the staff lost during all the disruption at that time included 4 of 7 people trained to process and manage LiA member loans. Those who were left with loans training were heaped with mountains of new community management responsibilities on their plates. Everything related to the loans program seemed upside down and got out of synch for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Most LiA borrowers experienced<\/b> a 1-3 month period after the September events \r\nwhen payments due to them from the Invisible Children bracelet project were \r\ndelayed.

However, in \r\nthe wake of September's disruption, the paper files for the loan program were \r\nalso left in disarray and the computerized records were gone. It took over 3 months \r\nfor David Ewaku, a Life in Africa Board Member, to reconstruct the records and \r\nget the partnerships with Kiva (esp. online) and Invisible Children somewhat \r\nback on track, so that <b>by January 2007 loan payments were coming in smoothly again<\/b>. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, part of why it took so long was that David fell very ill and has \r\nbeen in and out of <b>hospital<\/b> since November.

Yet another \r\ndisaster - the <b>new accounts manager<\/b> took over David's updated loan program records, and proceeded \r\nthrough <b>professional incompetence<\/b> to make a complete mess of them over the next 4 months. She \r\nresigned in mid-March 2007 after receiving a warning letter from the community operations team about her performance. \r\nWe now find ourselves consulting 3 different sources of information that are \r\nriddled with holes and mistakes in order to get an accurate picture of what our \r\nborrowers have actually paid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a recent telephone discussion with Kiva staff about the apparent arrears in our loan portfolio, and with me hosting meetings in my home and participating in an advisory team for organizing Kiva's forthcoming ground-truthing efforts in East Africa this past week, we at LiA have been feeling a very keen sense of urgency about updating our payments on the Kiva website. Luckily, the community has Grace - our star community leader\/borrower who is  \r\nfeatured in the PBS Frontline segment about Kiva. Over the past 2 years, she \r\nhas dedicated her heart and soul to uplifting Life in Africa's communities in \r\nboth Kampala and Gulu. Though she is no accountant, <b>Grace Ayaa has now committed herself to taking the LiA loan program's administrative challenges by the horns<\/b>. <br><br>Over the past 2 weeks Grace has been working with a small group of community \r\nmembers to figure out how to reconstruct the community's loan program records, so that more than \r\none person understands the process that's been used and everyone can agree on \r\nthe final updated report. I can see she is very determined to do this transparently and am grateful on \r\nbehalf of the LiA community to Grace for the leadership she's investing in \r\ngetting our payment and loan tracking system straight and systemized once and \r\nfor all.  In fact, she  had hoped to finish everything before leaving for a short trip to Gulu this \r\nmorning. Instead, <b>Grace and her group of committee members have asked me to appeal \r\ndirectly for lenders' patience<\/b>. They feel that getting this sorted out \r\nright means it should not be approached in haste - they need more time to talk to the borrowers one by one to compare their records & recollections with the office records to get an accurate final picture of where each member stands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\r\n<b><u>PLEASE NOTE:<\/u> To avoid that ALL of our members' online \r\nrecords are negatively affected any further by this internal administrative \r\ncrisis, we are today marking all scheduled member loan payments as paid up to \r\nthis month on the Kiva website. <\/b> The amount paid on each account has been determined by the Kiva bulk-payments  feature as the scheduled amount outstanding due to Kiva. Our community has, after all, guaranteed that \r\neach of these loans will be fully repaid to the lenders, regardless of each borrower's actual performance. Nonetheless, once we have all of this sorted out, we will update all of you (hopefully with next month's payments) on the accurate situation for your borrower with a link to the full \r\nand actual member repayment records for all loans guaranteed by the LiA \r\ncommunity in 2006. <b>In the cases where payments posted on Kiva were already up to date, I have posted a $1 payment to be able to alert all of our lenders to this message.<\/b> <br>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\nI humbly hope you can <b>forgive us at LiA for not communicating with lenders earlier about the challenges<\/b> we've faced in keeping the payments on Kiva accurately recorded, and thank you for your continued patience as the community works in good faith to get the mess sorted out.  It is likely Kiva will be sending a Kiva Fellow to work with us during the summer months, which - combined with the lessons we've already learned - will undoubtedly help us stay on a better track as we now begin raising loan funds for more members in both Kampala and Gulu. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, any <b>lenders with constructive support to offer, or with an interest in volunteering<\/b> with our microfinance program in Uganda, are most welcome to join us in dialogue at the Omidyar.net communuty and contact Grace Ayaa online at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.omidyar.net\/group\/lia\/\">http:\/\/www.omidyar.net\/group\/lia\/<\/a>.

She \r\nresigned in mid-March 2007 after receiving a warning letter from the community operations team about her performance. \r\nWe now find ourselves consulting 3 different sources of information that are \r\nriddled with holes and mistakes in order to get an accurate picture of what our \r\nborrowers have actually paid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a recent telephone discussion with Kiva staff about the apparent arrears in our loan portfolio, and with me hosting meetings in my home and participating in an advisory team for organizing Kiva's forthcoming ground-truthing efforts in East Africa this past week, we at LiA have been feeling a very keen sense of urgency about updating our payments on the Kiva website. Luckily, the community has Grace - our star community leader\/borrower who is  \r\nfeatured in the PBS Frontline segment about Kiva. Over the past 2 years, she \r\nhas dedicated her heart and soul to uplifting Life in Africa's communities in \r\nboth Kampala and Gulu. Though she is no accountant, <b>Grace Ayaa has now committed herself to taking the LiA loan program's administrative challenges by the horns<\/b>. <br><br>Over the past 2 weeks Grace has been working with a small group of community \r\nmembers to figure out how to reconstruct the community's loan program records, so that more than \r\none person understands the process that's been used and everyone can agree on \r\nthe final updated report. I can see she is very determined to do this transparently and am grateful on \r\nbehalf of the LiA community to Grace for the leadership she's investing in \r\ngetting our payment and loan tracking system straight and systemized once and \r\nfor all.  In fact, she  had hoped to finish everything before leaving for a short trip to Gulu this \r\nmorning. Instead, <b>Grace and her group of committee members have asked me to appeal \r\ndirectly for lenders' patience<\/b>. They feel that getting this sorted out \r\nright means it should not be approached in haste - they need more time to talk to the borrowers one by one to compare their records & recollections with the office records to get an accurate final picture of where each member stands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\r\n<b><u>PLEASE NOTE:<\/u> To avoid that ALL of our members' online \r\nrecords are negatively affected any further by this internal administrative \r\ncrisis, we are today marking all scheduled member loan payments as paid up to \r\nthis month on the Kiva website. <\/b> The amount paid on each account has been determined by the Kiva bulk-payments  feature as the scheduled amount outstanding due to Kiva. Our community has, after all, guaranteed that \r\neach of these loans will be fully repaid to the lenders, regardless of each borrower's actual performance. Nonetheless, once we have all of this sorted out, we will update all of you (hopefully with next month's payments) on the accurate situation for your borrower with a link to the full \r\nand actual member repayment records for all loans guaranteed by the LiA \r\ncommunity in 2006. <b>In the cases where payments posted on Kiva were already up to date, I have posted a $1 payment to be able to alert all of our lenders to this message.<\/b> <br>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\nI humbly hope you can <b>forgive us at LiA for not communicating with lenders earlier about the challenges<\/b> we've faced in keeping the payments on Kiva accurately recorded, and thank you for your continued patience as the community works in good faith to get the mess sorted out.  It is likely Kiva will be sending a Kiva Fellow to work with us during the summer months, which - combined with the lessons we've already learned - will undoubtedly help us stay on a better track as we now begin raising loan funds for more members in both Kampala and Gulu. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, any <b>lenders with constructive support to offer, or with an interest in volunteering<\/b> with our microfinance program in Uganda, are most welcome to join us in dialogue at the Omidyar.net communuty and contact Grace Ayaa online at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.omidyar.net\/group\/lia\/\">http:\/\/www.omidyar.net\/group\/lia\/<\/a>.

He was very excited to join since LiA offered him the opportunity to develop and use his artistic talent as well as to earn an income. He proved to be a fast learner and very quickly earned a job with the Invisible Children Bracelet project where he works as a sander.<\/p><p>This income is very important to him. He is just a young man but when his father died he was the oldest and it was up to him to take over the responsiblity for his mother and younger siblings. He tried at first to do this by selling his artwork. He quickly found that selling art is not like selling food or charcoal which are needed on a daily basis. Art is more of a luxury and this made their life very difficult. But he is determined to do right for his family and he came up with a plan.<\/p><p>His plan is to cash in on the high demand for decent housing by building three rooms to rent out. He and his brothers have worked very hard and have made 7000 bricks by hand that are now ready to be fired. He knows that once this project is complete the income will greatly improve their lives and will insure that there is sufficent money for school fees and medicine for his younger siblings. He is seeking a loan in the amount of 800,000 which will fire the bricks and build the house up to the beams.

In an effort to model a high standard of \r\nthe transparency we operating in Africa should uphold online, this \r\nrather long message contains details that are relevant to helping you \r\nunderstand what's already happened, and what's happening now in the Life in Africa community with regard to this \r\nissue. Rest assured, Kiva staff are aware of these issues and some have \r\npersonally met, face to face, a number of the personalities involved. We at LiA feel it's now high time to let you - our valued lenders - in on the sensitive nature of the challenges we've been dealing with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn September 2006, <b>some LiA community members<\/b> tasked to manage the loan program \r\nand the Invisible Children bracelet campaign <b>resigned amidst accusations of \r\nmismanagement<\/b> from other members in the Life in Africa community. In the process, which was painful but arguably very healthy for the community in important ways,  \r\na laptop was stolen that included the records for both programs, the WE Center \r\nwas closed for 2 weeks, and management of the invisible children project shifted \r\nto another site, taking 35 (of 80) Life in Africa members involved in the \r\nproject with them to be full time employees. Among the staff lost during all the disruption at that time included 4 of 7 people trained to process and manage LiA member loans. Those who were left with loans training were heaped with mountains of new community management responsibilities on their plates. Everything related to the loans program seemed upside down and got out of synch for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Most LiA borrowers experienced<\/b> a 1-3 month period after the September events \r\nwhen payments due to them from the Invisible Children bracelet project were \r\ndelayed. Many fell into <b>arrears on their loans<\/b> at that time. In most (but not \r\nall) of those cases, those arrears have now been paid up to date. However, in \r\nthe wake of September's disruption, the paper files for the loan program were \r\nalso left in disarray and the computerized records were gone. It took over 3 months \r\nfor David Ewaku, a Life in Africa Board Member, to reconstruct the records and \r\nget the partnerships with Kiva (esp. online) and Invisible Children somewhat \r\nback on track, so that <b>by January 2007 loan payments were coming in smoothly again<\/b>. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, part of why it took so long was that David fell very ill and has \r\nbeen in and out of <b>hospital<\/b> since November. By then, however, we had hired a recent MBA grad with experience in microfinance \r\nas full time accounts manager for the Life in Africa community. Yet another \r\ndisaster - the <b>new accounts manager<\/b> took over David's updated loan program records, and proceeded \r\nthrough <b>professional incompetence<\/b> to make a complete mess of them over the next 4 months. She \r\nresigned in mid-March 2007 after receiving a warning letter from the community operations team about her performance. \r\nWe now find ourselves consulting 3 different sources of information that are \r\nriddled with holes and mistakes in order to get an accurate picture of what our \r\nborrowers have actually paid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a recent telephone discussion with Kiva staff about the apparent arrears in our loan portfolio, and with me hosting meetings in my home and participating in an advisory team for organizing Kiva's forthcoming ground-truthing efforts in East Africa this past week, we at LiA have been feeling a very keen sense of urgency about updating our payments on the Kiva website, but the current state of the payment records is discouraging. Luckily, the community has Grace - our star community leader\/borrower who is  \r\nfeatured in the PBS Frontline segment about Kiva. Over the past 2 years, she \r\nhas dedicated her heart and soul to uplifting Life in Africa's communities in \r\nboth Kampala and Gulu. Though she is no accountant, <b>Grace Ayaa has now committed herself to taking the LiA loan program's administrative challenges by the horns<\/b>. <br><br>Over the past 2 weeks Grace has been working with a small group of community \r\nmembers to figure out how to reconstruct the community's loan program records, so that more than \r\none person understands the process that's been used and everyone can agree on \r\nthe final updated report. I can see she is very determined to do this transparently and am grateful on \r\nbehalf of the LiA community to Grace for the leadership she's investing in \r\ngetting our payment and loan tracking system straight and systemized once and \r\nfor all.  In fact, she  had hoped to finish everything before leaving for a short trip to Gulu this \r\nmorning. Instead, <b>Grace and her group of committee members have asked me to appeal \r\ndirectly for lenders' patience<\/b>. They feel that getting this sorted out \r\nright means it should not be approached in haste - they need more time to talk to the borrowers one by one to compare their records & recollections with the office records to get an accurate final picture of where each member stands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\r\n<b><u>PLEASE NOTE:<\/u> To avoid that ALL of our members' online \r\nrecords are negatively affected any further by this internal administrative \r\ncrisis, we are today marking all scheduled member loan payments as paid up to \r\nthis month on the Kiva website. <\/b> The amount paid on each account has been determined by the Kiva bulk-payments  feature as the scheduled amount outstanding due to Kiva. Our community has, after all, guaranteed that \r\neach of these loans will be fully repaid to the lenders, regardless of each borrower's actual performance. Nonetheless, once we have all of this sorted out, we will update all of you (hopefully with next month's payments) on the accurate situation for your borrower with a link to the full \r\nand actual member repayment records for all loans guaranteed by the LiA \r\ncommunity in 2006. <b>In the cases where payments posted on Kiva were already up to date, I have posted a $1 payment to be able to alert all of our lenders to this message.<\/b> <br>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\nI humbly hope you can <b>forgive us at LiA for not communicating with lenders earlier about the challenges<\/b> we've faced in keeping the payments on Kiva accurately recorded, and thank you for your continued patience as the community works in good faith to get the mess sorted out.  It is likely Kiva will be sending a Kiva Fellow to work with us during the summer months, which - combined with the lessons we've already learned - will undoubtedly help us stay on a better track as we now begin raising loan funds for more members in both Kampala and Gulu. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, any <b>lenders with constructive support to offer, or with an interest in volunteering<\/b> with our microfinance program in Uganda, are most welcome to join us in dialogue at the Omidyar.net communuty and contact Grace Ayaa online at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.omidyar.net\/group\/lia\/\">http:\/\/www.omidyar.net\/group\/lia\/<\/a>.

In the process, which was painful but arguably very healthy for the community in important ways,  \r\na laptop was stolen that included the records for both programs, the WE Center \r\nwas closed for 2 weeks, and management of the invisible children project shifted \r\nto another site, taking 35 (of 80) Life in Africa members involved in the \r\nproject with them to be full time employees. Among the staff lost during all the disruption at that time included 4 of 7 people trained to process and manage LiA member loans. Those who were left with loans training were heaped with mountains of new community management responsibilities on their plates. Everything related to the loans program seemed upside down and got out of synch for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Most LiA borrowers experienced<\/b> a 1-3 month period after the September events \r\nwhen payments due to them from the Invisible Children bracelet project were \r\ndelayed.

However, in \r\nthe wake of September's disruption, the paper files for the loan program were \r\nalso left in disarray and the computerized records were gone. It took over 3 months \r\nfor David Ewaku, a Life in Africa Board Member, to reconstruct the records and \r\nget the partnerships with Kiva (esp. online) and Invisible Children somewhat \r\nback on track, so that <b>by January 2007 loan payments were coming in smoothly again<\/b>. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, part of why it took so long was that David fell very ill and has \r\nbeen in and out of <b>hospital<\/b> since November.

Luckily, the community has Grace - our star community leader\/borrower who is  \r\nfeatured in the PBS Frontline segment about Kiva. Over the past 2 years, she \r\nhas dedicated her heart and soul to uplifting Life in Africa's communities in \r\nboth Kampala and Gulu. Though she is no accountant, <b>Grace Ayaa has now committed herself to taking the LiA loan program's administrative challenges by the horns<\/b>. <br><br>Over the past 2 weeks Grace has been working with a small group of community \r\nmembers to figure out how to reconstruct the community's loan program records, so that more than \r\none person understands the process that's been used and everyone can agree on \r\nthe final updated report. I can see she is very determined to do this transparently and am grateful on \r\nbehalf of the LiA community to Grace for the leadership she's investing in \r\ngetting our payment and loan tracking system straight and systemized once and \r\nfor all.  In fact, she  had hoped to finish everything before leaving for a short trip to Gulu this \r\nmorning. Instead, <b>Grace and her group of committee members have asked me to appeal \r\ndirectly for lenders' patience<\/b>.

Nonetheless, once we have all of this sorted out, we will update all of you (hopefully with next month's payments) on the accurate situation for your borrower with a link to the full \r\nand actual member repayment records for all loans guaranteed by the LiA \r\ncommunity in 2006. <b>In the cases where payments posted on Kiva were already up to date, I have posted a $1 payment to be able to alert all of our lenders to this message.<\/b> <br>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\nI humbly hope you can <b>forgive us at LiA for not communicating with lenders earlier about the challenges<\/b> we've faced in keeping the payments on Kiva accurately recorded, and thank you for your continued patience as the community works in good faith to get the mess sorted out.

Kiva Lenders to Life in Africa borrowers in Uganda,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn behalf of Life in Africa's WE Center Kampala community I offer an <b>apology for the irregularities in posting our borrower repayments and journal updates to the Kiva \r\nwebsite<\/b> over the past several months. In an effort to model a high standard of \r\nthe transparency we operating in Africa should uphold online, this \r\nrather long message contains details that are relevant to helping you \r\nunderstand what's already happened, and what's happening now in the Life in Africa community with regard to this \r\nissue. Rest assured, Kiva staff are aware of these issues and some have \r\npersonally met, face to face, a number of the personalities involved. We at LiA feel it's now high time to let you - our valued lenders - in on the sensitive nature of the challenges we've been dealing with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn September 2006, <b>some LiA community members<\/b> tasked to manage the loan program \r\nand the Invisible Children bracelet campaign <b>resigned amidst accusations of \r\nmismanagement<\/b> from other members in the Life in Africa community. In the process, which was painful but arguably very healthy for the community in important ways,  \r\na laptop was stolen that included the records for both programs, the WE Center \r\nwas closed for 2 weeks, and management of the invisible children project shifted \r\nto another site, taking 35 (of 80) Life in Africa members involved in the \r\nproject with them to be full time employees. Among the staff lost during all the disruption at that time included 4 of 7 people trained to process and manage LiA member loans. Those who were left with loans training were heaped with mountains of new community management responsibilities on their plates. Everything related to the loans program seemed upside down and got out of synch for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Most LiA borrowers experienced<\/b> a 1-3 month period after the September events \r\nwhen payments due to them from the Invisible Children bracelet project were \r\ndelayed. Many fell into <b>arrears on their loans<\/b> at that time. In most (but not \r\nall) of those cases, those arrears have now been paid up to date. However, in \r\nthe wake of September's disruption, the paper files for the loan program were \r\nalso left in disarray and the computerized records were gone. It took over 3 months \r\nfor David Ewaku, a Life in Africa Board Member, to reconstruct the records and \r\nget the partnerships with Kiva (esp. online) and Invisible Children somewhat \r\nback on track, so that <b>by January 2007 loan payments were coming in smoothly again<\/b>. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, part of why it took so long was that David fell very ill and has \r\nbeen in and out of <b>hospital<\/b> since November. By then, however, we had hired a recent MBA grad with experience in microfinance \r\nas full time accounts manager for the Life in Africa community. Yet another \r\ndisaster - the <b>new accounts manager<\/b> took over David's updated loan program records, and proceeded \r\nthrough <b>professional incompetence<\/b> to make a complete mess of them over the next 4 months. She \r\nresigned in mid-March 2007 after receiving a warning letter from the community operations team about her performance. \r\nWe now find ourselves consulting 3 different sources of information that are \r\nriddled with holes and mistakes in order to get an accurate picture of what our \r\nborrowers have actually paid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a recent telephone discussion with Kiva staff about the apparent arrears in our loan portfolio, and with me hosting meetings in my home and participating in an advisory team for organizing Kiva's forthcoming ground-truthing efforts in East Africa this past week, we at LiA have been feeling a very keen sense of urgency about updating our payments on the Kiva website. Luckily, the community has Grace - our star community leader\/borrower who is  \r\nfeatured in the PBS Frontline segment about Kiva. Over the past 2 years, she \r\nhas dedicated her heart and soul to uplifting Life in Africa's communities in \r\nboth Kampala and Gulu. Though she is no accountant, <b>Grace Ayaa has now committed herself to taking the LiA loan program's administrative challenges by the horns<\/b>. <br><br>Over the past 2 weeks Grace has been working with a small group of community \r\nmembers to figure out how to reconstruct the community's loan program records, so that more than \r\none person understands the process that's been used and everyone can agree on \r\nthe final updated report. I can see she is very determined to do this transparently and am grateful on \r\nbehalf of the LiA community to Grace for the leadership she's investing in \r\ngetting our payment and loan tracking system straight and systemized once and \r\nfor all.  In fact, she  had hoped to finish everything before leaving for a short trip to Gulu this \r\nmorning. Instead, <b>Grace and her group of committee members have asked me to appeal \r\ndirectly for lenders' patience<\/b>. They feel that getting this sorted out \r\nright means it should not be approached in haste - they need more time to talk to the borrowers one by one to compare their records & recollections with the office records to get an accurate final picture of where each member stands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\r\n<b><u>PLEASE NOTE:<\/u> To avoid that ALL of our members' online \r\nrecords are negatively affected any further by this internal administrative \r\ncrisis, we are today marking all scheduled member loan payments as paid up to \r\nthis month on the Kiva website. <\/b> The amount paid on each account has been determined by the Kiva bulk-payments  feature as the scheduled amount outstanding due to Kiva. Our community has, after all, guaranteed that \r\neach of these loans will be fully repaid to the lenders, regardless of each borrower's actual performance.

She started as a volunteer working in the arts and crafts center and then moved to a paying job working with the Invisible Children Bracelet project. She enjoys working on this project and at LiA because it offers the workers a way out of poverty. She is a single woman living on her own without the help of her family and her salary sustains her.<\/p><p>She has been fortunate to be able to live with friends who agreed to help her. Out of kindness toward her they have not charged her any rent. But she knows that this cannot continue since their own situation is very unstable. While she is very grateful for their kindness, she is now looking for a way to provide housing for herself as well as to add to her income. She has realized that housing is in great demand all the time in Kampala and she has decided to invest in property for herself and to rent out for income.<\/p><p>The first phase of this project will be to secure a plot of land. She has found the plot she wants and she has successfully negotiated a deal with the landowner. If she can come up with the money needed by the end of June he will sell her the property. Once she has paid for the land, she will then build a house on it to live in and also apartments that she will rent out. In this way she will be able to secure her future. To succeed at this she is seeking a loan in the amount of 800,000 to add to the 2,200,000 that she has managed to save herself. She will be able to repay this loan in 10 months.<\/p><p>This is her budget: Land Aqcuisition --- 800,000\/= Total 800,000\/=<\/p><p>WE Team to benefit: integrated Adult Education <\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":616,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Land Rental","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchasing a plot of land for construction","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kampala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.315556 32.565556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":8,"posted_date":"2006-05-24T18:28:59Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Annet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2006-06-13T18:40:08Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":450,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2006-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2006-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2006-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2006-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2006-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2006-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2007-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2007-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2007-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2007-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2007-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2007-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2006-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2006-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2006-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2006-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2007-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2007-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2007-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2007-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2007-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2007-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2006-07-17T17:11:00Z","settlement_date":"2007-06-20T09:15:18Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":603,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2006-08-18T14:17:41Z","settlement_date":"2007-06-20T09:15:18Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":954,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2006-09-24T19:11:37Z","settlement_date":"2007-06-20T09:15:18Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":1375,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2006-11-24T18:43:33Z","settlement_date":"2007-06-20T09:15:18Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":2667,"comment":null},{"amount":59,"local_amount":59,"processed_date":"2007-01-22T19:38:06Z","settlement_date":"2007-06-20T09:15:18Z","rounded_local_amount":59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5002,"comment":null},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2007-03-21T01:59:47Z","settlement_date":"2007-06-20T09:15:18Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10596,"comment":"scheduled repayment"},{"amount":-83,"local_amount":-83,"processed_date":"2007-03-21T20:41:42Z","settlement_date":"2007-06-20T09:15:18Z","rounded_local_amount":-83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":11153,"comment":"adjustment: reversing payment (id=10596, posted erroneously)"},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2007-04-02T09:30:11Z","settlement_date":"2007-06-20T09:15:18Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":12101,"comment":"scheduled repayment"},{"amount":1,"local_amount":1,"processed_date":"2007-04-14T20:23:38Z","settlement_date":"2007-06-20T09:15:18Z","rounded_local_amount":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":12966,"comment":"<p>Dear Kiva Lenders to Life in Africa borrowers in Uganda,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn behalf of Life in Africa's WE Center Kampala community I offer an <b>apology for the irregularities in posting our borrower repayments and journal updates to the Kiva \r\nwebsite<\/b> over the past several months. In an effort to model a high standard of \r\nthe transparency we operating in Africa should uphold online, this \r\nrather long message contains details that are relevant to helping you \r\nunderstand what's already happened, and what's happening now in the Life in Africa community with regard to this \r\nissue. Rest assured, Kiva staff are aware of these issues and some have \r\npersonally met, face to face, a number of the personalities involved. We at LiA feel it's now high time to let you - our valued lenders - in on the sensitive nature of the challenges we've been dealing with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn September 2006, <b>some LiA community members<\/b> tasked to manage the loan program \r\nand the Invisible Children bracelet campaign <b>resigned amidst accusations of \r\nmismanagement<\/b> from other members in the Life in Africa community. In the process, which was painful but arguably very healthy for the community in important ways,  \r\na laptop was stolen that included the records for both programs, the WE Center \r\nwas closed for 2 weeks, and management of the invisible children project shifted \r\nto another site, taking 35 (of 80) Life in Africa members involved in the \r\nproject with them to be full time employees. Among the staff lost during all the disruption at that time included 4 of 7 people trained to process and manage LiA member loans. Those who were left with loans training were heaped with mountains of new community management responsibilities on their plates. Everything related to the loans program seemed upside down and got out of synch for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Most LiA borrowers experienced<\/b> a 1-3 month period after the September events \r\nwhen payments due to them from the Invisible Children bracelet project were \r\ndelayed. Many fell into <b>arrears on their loans<\/b> at that time. In most (but not \r\nall) of those cases, those arrears have now been paid up to date. However, in \r\nthe wake of September's disruption, the paper files for the loan program were \r\nalso left in disarray and the computerized records were gone. It took over 3 months \r\nfor David Ewaku, a Life in Africa Board Member, to reconstruct the records and \r\nget the partnerships with Kiva (esp. online) and Invisible Children somewhat \r\nback on track, so that <b>by January 2007 loan payments were coming in smoothly again<\/b>. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, part of why it took so long was that David fell very ill and has \r\nbeen in and out of <b>hospital<\/b> since November. By then, however, we had hired a recent MBA grad with experience in microfinance \r\nas full time accounts manager for the Life in Africa community. Yet another \r\ndisaster - the <b>new accounts manager<\/b> took over David's updated loan program records, and proceeded \r\nthrough <b>professional incompetence<\/b> to make a complete mess of them over the next 4 months. She \r\nresigned in mid-March 2007 after receiving a warning letter from the community operations team about her performance. \r\nWe now find ourselves consulting 3 different sources of information that are \r\nriddled with holes and mistakes in order to get an accurate picture of what our \r\nborrowers have actually paid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a recent telephone discussion with Kiva staff about the apparent arrears in our loan portfolio, and with me hosting meetings in my home and participating in an advisory team for organizing Kiva's forthcoming ground-truthing efforts in East Africa this past week, we at LiA have been feeling a very keen sense of urgency about updating our payments on the Kiva website, but the current state of the payment records is discouraging. Luckily, the community has Grace - our star community leader\/borrower who is  \r\nfeatured in the PBS Frontline segment about Kiva. Over the past 2 years, she \r\nhas dedicated her heart and soul to uplifting Life in Africa's communities in \r\nboth Kampala and Gulu. Though she is no accountant, <b>Grace Ayaa has now committed herself to taking the LiA loan program's administrative challenges by the horns<\/b>. <br><br>Over the past 2 weeks Grace has been working with a small group of community \r\nmembers to figure out how to reconstruct the community's loan program records, so that more than \r\none person understands the process that's been used and everyone can agree on \r\nthe final updated report. I can see she is very determined to do this transparently and am grateful on \r\nbehalf of the LiA community to Grace for the leadership she's investing in \r\ngetting our payment and loan tracking system straight and systemized once and \r\nfor all.  In fact, she  had hoped to finish everything before leaving for a short trip to Gulu this \r\nmorning. Instead, <b>Grace and her group of committee members have asked me to appeal \r\ndirectly for lenders' patience<\/b>. They feel that getting this sorted out \r\nright means it should not be approached in haste - they need more time to talk to the borrowers one by one to compare their records & recollections with the office records to get an accurate final picture of where each member stands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\r\n<b><u>PLEASE NOTE:<\/u> To avoid that ALL of our members' online \r\nrecords are negatively affected any further by this internal administrative \r\ncrisis, we are today marking all scheduled member loan payments as paid up to \r\nthis month on the Kiva website. <\/b> The amount paid on each account has been determined by the Kiva bulk-payments  feature as the scheduled amount outstanding due to Kiva. Our community has, after all, guaranteed that \r\neach of these loans will be fully repaid to the lenders, regardless of each borrower's actual performance. Nonetheless, once we have all of this sorted out, we will update all of you (hopefully with next month's payments) on the accurate situation for your borrower with a link to the full \r\nand actual member repayment records for all loans guaranteed by the LiA \r\ncommunity in 2006. <b>In the cases where payments posted on Kiva were already up to date, I have posted a $1 payment to be able to alert all of our lenders to this message.<\/b> <br>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\nI humbly hope you can <b>forgive us at LiA for not communicating with lenders earlier about the challenges<\/b> we've faced in keeping the payments on Kiva accurately recorded, and thank you for your continued patience as the community works in good faith to get the mess sorted out.

Rose is an active member of Life in Africa working in the Invisible Children Bracelet project. She is 34 years old, is married and has 6 children.

Her children were gone for two years but were finally rescued by government troups and were returned to her in the camp she fled to in Kampala. Rose and her husband both started working in the stone quarry but they were not able to earn enough to sustain the family. When she joined LiA their lives took a turn for the better. They have more money and they have been able to save enough to build a modest home which also helps financially since they no longer have to pay rent.<\/p><p>Their plan now is to enlarge the stone quarry work that her husband still does.

In the process, which was painful but arguably very healthy for the community in important ways,  \r\na laptop was stolen that included the records for both programs, the WE Center \r\nwas closed for 2 weeks, and management of the invisible children project shifted \r\nto another site, taking 35 (of 80) Life in Africa members involved in the \r\nproject with them to be full time employees. Among the staff lost during all the disruption at that time included 4 of 7 people trained to process and manage LiA member loans. Those who were left with loans training were heaped with mountains of new community management responsibilities on their plates. Everything related to the loans program seemed upside down and got out of synch for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Most LiA borrowers experienced<\/b> a 1-3 month period after the September events \r\nwhen payments due to them from the Invisible Children bracelet project were \r\ndelayed.

However, in \r\nthe wake of September's disruption, the paper files for the loan program were \r\nalso left in disarray and the computerized records were gone. It took over 3 months \r\nfor David Ewaku, a Life in Africa Board Member, to reconstruct the records and \r\nget the partnerships with Kiva (esp. online) and Invisible Children somewhat \r\nback on track, so that <b>by January 2007 loan payments were coming in smoothly again<\/b>. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, part of why it took so long was that David fell very ill and has \r\nbeen in and out of <b>hospital<\/b> since November.

Yet another \r\ndisaster - the <b>new accounts manager<\/b> took over David's updated loan program records, and proceeded \r\nthrough <b>professional incompetence<\/b> to make a complete mess of them over the next 4 months. She \r\nresigned in mid-March 2007 after receiving a warning letter from the community operations team about her performance. \r\nWe now find ourselves consulting 3 different sources of information that are \r\nriddled with holes and mistakes in order to get an accurate picture of what our \r\nborrowers have actually paid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a recent telephone discussion with Kiva staff about the apparent arrears in our loan portfolio, and with me hosting meetings in my home and participating in an advisory team for organizing Kiva's forthcoming ground-truthing efforts in East Africa this past week, we at LiA have been feeling a very keen sense of urgency about updating our payments on the Kiva website. Luckily, the community has Grace - our star community leader\/borrower who is  \r\nfeatured in the PBS Frontline segment about Kiva. Over the past 2 years, she \r\nhas dedicated her heart and soul to uplifting Life in Africa's communities in \r\nboth Kampala and Gulu. Though she is no accountant, <b>Grace Ayaa has now committed herself to taking the LiA loan program's administrative challenges by the horns<\/b>. <br><br>Over the past 2 weeks Grace has been working with a small group of community \r\nmembers to figure out how to reconstruct the community's loan program records, so that more than \r\none person understands the process that's been used and everyone can agree on \r\nthe final updated report. I can see she is very determined to do this transparently and am grateful on \r\nbehalf of the LiA community to Grace for the leadership she's investing in \r\ngetting our payment and loan tracking system straight and systemized once and \r\nfor all.  In fact, she  had hoped to finish everything before leaving for a short trip to Gulu this \r\nmorning. Instead, <b>Grace and her group of committee members have asked me to appeal \r\ndirectly for lenders' patience<\/b>. They feel that getting this sorted out \r\nright means it should not be approached in haste - they need more time to talk to the borrowers one by one to compare their records & recollections with the office records to get an accurate final picture of where each member stands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\r\n<b><u>PLEASE NOTE:<\/u> To avoid that ALL of our members' online \r\nrecords are negatively affected any further by this internal administrative \r\ncrisis, we are today marking all scheduled member loan payments as paid up to \r\nthis month on the Kiva website. <\/b> The amount paid on each account has been determined by the Kiva bulk-payments  feature as the scheduled amount outstanding due to Kiva. Our community has, after all, guaranteed that \r\neach of these loans will be fully repaid to the lenders, regardless of each borrower's actual performance. Nonetheless, once we have all of this sorted out, we will update all of you (hopefully with next month's payments) on the accurate situation for your borrower with a link to the full \r\nand actual member repayment records for all loans guaranteed by the LiA \r\ncommunity in 2006. <b>In the cases where payments posted on Kiva were already up to date, I have posted a $1 payment to be able to alert all of our lenders to this message.<\/b> <br>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\nI humbly hope you can <b>forgive us at LiA for not communicating with lenders earlier about the challenges<\/b> we've faced in keeping the payments on Kiva accurately recorded, and thank you for your continued patience as the community works in good faith to get the mess sorted out.  It is likely Kiva will be sending a Kiva Fellow to work with us during the summer months, which - combined with the lessons we've already learned - will undoubtedly help us stay on a better track as we now begin raising loan funds for more members in both Kampala and Gulu. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, any <b>lenders with constructive support to offer, or with an interest in volunteering<\/b> with our microfinance program in Uganda, are most welcome to join us in dialogue at the Omidyar.net communuty and contact Grace Ayaa online at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.omidyar.net\/group\/lia\/\">http:\/\/www.omidyar.net\/group\/lia\/<\/a>.

Kiva Lenders to Life in Africa borrowers in Uganda,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn behalf of Life in Africa's WE Center Kampala community I offer an <b>apology for the irregularities in posting our borrower repayments and journal updates to the Kiva \r\nwebsite<\/b> over the past several months. In an effort to model a high standard of \r\nthe transparency we operating in Africa should uphold online, this \r\nrather long message contains details that are relevant to helping you \r\nunderstand what's already happened, and what's happening now in the Life in Africa community with regard to this \r\nissue. Rest assured, Kiva staff are aware of these issues and some have \r\npersonally met, face to face, a number of the personalities involved. We at LiA feel it's now high time to let you - our valued lenders - in on the sensitive nature of the challenges we've been dealing with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn September 2006, <b>some LiA community members<\/b> tasked to manage the loan program \r\nand the Invisible Children bracelet campaign <b>resigned amidst accusations of \r\nmismanagement<\/b> from other members in the Life in Africa community. In the process, which was painful but arguably very healthy for the community in important ways,  \r\na laptop was stolen that included the records for both programs, the WE Center \r\nwas closed for 2 weeks, and management of the invisible children project shifted \r\nto another site, taking 35 (of 80) Life in Africa members involved in the \r\nproject with them to be full time employees. Among the staff lost during all the disruption at that time included 4 of 7 people trained to process and manage LiA member loans. Those who were left with loans training were heaped with mountains of new community management responsibilities on their plates. Everything related to the loans program seemed upside down and got out of synch for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Most LiA borrowers experienced<\/b> a 1-3 month period after the September events \r\nwhen payments due to them from the Invisible Children bracelet project were \r\ndelayed. Many fell into <b>arrears on their loans<\/b> at that time. In most (but not \r\nall) of those cases, those arrears have now been paid up to date. However, in \r\nthe wake of September's disruption, the paper files for the loan program were \r\nalso left in disarray and the computerized records were gone. It took over 3 months \r\nfor David Ewaku, a Life in Africa Board Member, to reconstruct the records and \r\nget the partnerships with Kiva (esp. online) and Invisible Children somewhat \r\nback on track, so that <b>by January 2007 loan payments were coming in smoothly again<\/b>. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, part of why it took so long was that David fell very ill and has \r\nbeen in and out of <b>hospital<\/b> since November. By then, however, we had hired a recent MBA grad with experience in microfinance \r\nas full time accounts manager for the Life in Africa community. Yet another \r\ndisaster - the <b>new accounts manager<\/b> took over David's updated loan program records, and proceeded \r\nthrough <b>professional incompetence<\/b> to make a complete mess of them over the next 4 months.

Kiva Lenders to Life in Africa borrowers in Uganda,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn behalf of Life in Africa's WE Center Kampala community I offer an <b>apology for the irregularities in posting our borrower repayments and journal updates to the Kiva \r\nwebsite<\/b> over the past several months. In an effort to model a high standard of \r\nthe transparency we operating in Africa should uphold online, this \r\nrather long message contains details that are relevant to helping you \r\nunderstand what's already happened, and what's happening now in the Life in Africa community with regard to this \r\nissue. Rest assured, Kiva staff are aware of these issues and some have \r\npersonally met, face to face, a number of the personalities involved. We at LiA feel it's now high time to let you - our valued lenders - in on the sensitive nature of the challenges we've been dealing with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn September 2006, <b>some LiA community members<\/b> tasked to manage the loan program \r\nand the Invisible Children bracelet campaign <b>resigned amidst accusations of \r\nmismanagement<\/b> from other members in the Life in Africa community. In the process, which was painful but arguably very healthy for the community in important ways,  \r\na laptop was stolen that included the records for both programs, the WE Center \r\nwas closed for 2 weeks, and management of the invisible children project shifted \r\nto another site, taking 35 (of 80) Life in Africa members involved in the \r\nproject with them to be full time employees. Among the staff lost during all the disruption at that time included 4 of 7 people trained to process and manage LiA member loans. Those who were left with loans training were heaped with mountains of new community management responsibilities on their plates. Everything related to the loans program seemed upside down and got out of synch for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Most LiA borrowers experienced<\/b> a 1-3 month period after the September events \r\nwhen payments due to them from the Invisible Children bracelet project were \r\ndelayed. Many fell into <b>arrears on their loans<\/b> at that time. In most (but not \r\nall) of those cases, those arrears have now been paid up to date. However, in \r\nthe wake of September's disruption, the paper files for the loan program were \r\nalso left in disarray and the computerized records were gone. It took over 3 months \r\nfor David Ewaku, a Life in Africa Board Member, to reconstruct the records and \r\nget the partnerships with Kiva (esp. online) and Invisible Children somewhat \r\nback on track, so that <b>by January 2007 loan payments were coming in smoothly again<\/b>. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, part of why it took so long was that David fell very ill and has \r\nbeen in and out of <b>hospital<\/b> since November. By then, however, we had hired a recent MBA grad with experience in microfinance \r\nas full time accounts manager for the Life in Africa community. Yet another \r\ndisaster - the <b>new accounts manager<\/b> took over David's updated loan program records, and proceeded \r\nthrough <b>professional incompetence<\/b> to make a complete mess of them over the next 4 months. She \r\nresigned in mid-March 2007 after receiving a warning letter from the community operations team about her performance. \r\nWe now find ourselves consulting 3 different sources of information that are \r\nriddled with holes and mistakes in order to get an accurate picture of what our \r\nborrowers have actually paid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a recent telephone discussion with Kiva staff about the apparent arrears in our loan portfolio, and with me hosting meetings in my home and participating in an advisory team for organizing Kiva's forthcoming ground-truthing efforts in East Africa this past week, we at LiA have been feeling a very keen sense of urgency about updating our payments on the Kiva website. Luckily, the community has Grace - our star community leader\/borrower who is  \r\nfeatured in the PBS Frontline segment about Kiva. Over the past 2 years, she \r\nhas dedicated her heart and soul to uplifting Life in Africa's communities in \r\nboth Kampala and Gulu. Though she is no accountant, <b>Grace Ayaa has now committed herself to taking the LiA loan program's administrative challenges by the horns<\/b>. <br><br>Over the past 2 weeks Grace has been working with a small group of community \r\nmembers to figure out how to reconstruct the community's loan program records, so that more than \r\none person understands the process that's been used and everyone can agree on \r\nthe final updated report. I can see she is very determined to do this transparently and am grateful on \r\nbehalf of the LiA community to Grace for the leadership she's investing in \r\ngetting our payment and loan tracking system straight and systemized once and \r\nfor all.  In fact, she  had hoped to finish everything before leaving for a short trip to Gulu this \r\nmorning. Instead, <b>Grace and her group of committee members have asked me to appeal \r\ndirectly for lenders' patience<\/b>. They feel that getting this sorted out \r\nright means it should not be approached in haste - they need more time to talk to the borrowers one by one to compare their records & recollections with the office records to get an accurate final picture of where each member stands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\r\n<b><u>PLEASE NOTE:<\/u> To avoid that ALL of our members' online \r\nrecords are negatively affected any further by this internal administrative \r\ncrisis, we are today marking all scheduled member loan payments as paid up to \r\nthis month on the Kiva website. <\/b> The amount paid on each account has been determined by the Kiva bulk-payments  feature as the scheduled amount outstanding due to Kiva. Our community has, after all, guaranteed that \r\neach of these loans will be fully repaid to the lenders, regardless of each borrower's actual performance. Nonetheless, once we have all of this sorted out, we will update all of you (hopefully with next month's payments) on the accurate situation for your borrower with a link to the full \r\nand actual member repayment records for all loans guaranteed by the LiA \r\ncommunity in 2006. <b>In the cases where payments posted on Kiva were already up to date, I have posted a $1 payment to be able to alert all of our lenders to this message.<\/b> <br>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\nI humbly hope you can <b>forgive us at LiA for not communicating with lenders earlier about the challenges<\/b> we've faced in keeping the payments on Kiva accurately recorded, and thank you for your continued patience as the community works in good faith to get the mess sorted out.  It is likely Kiva will be sending a Kiva Fellow to work with us during the summer months, which - combined with the lessons we've already learned - will undoubtedly help us stay on a better track as we now begin raising loan funds for more members in both Kampala and Gulu. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, any <b>lenders with constructive support to offer, or with an interest in volunteering<\/b> with our microfinance program in Uganda, are most welcome to join us in dialogue at the Omidyar.net communuty and contact Grace Ayaa online at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.omidyar.net\/group\/lia\/\">http:\/\/www.omidyar.net\/group\/lia\/<\/a>.

In an effort to model a high standard of \r\nthe transparency we operating in Africa should uphold online, this \r\nrather long message contains details that are relevant to helping you \r\nunderstand what's already happened, and what's happening now in the Life in Africa community with regard to this \r\nissue. Rest assured, Kiva staff are aware of these issues and some have \r\npersonally met, face to face, a number of the personalities involved. We at LiA feel it's now high time to let you - our valued lenders - in on the sensitive nature of the challenges we've been dealing with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn September 2006, <b>some LiA community members<\/b> tasked to manage the loan program \r\nand the Invisible Children bracelet campaign <b>resigned amidst accusations of \r\nmismanagement<\/b> from other members in the Life in Africa community. In the process, which was painful but arguably very healthy for the community in important ways,  \r\na laptop was stolen that included the records for both programs, the WE Center \r\nwas closed for 2 weeks, and management of the invisible children project shifted \r\nto another site, taking 35 (of 80) Life in Africa members involved in the \r\nproject with them to be full time employees. Among the staff lost during all the disruption at that time included 4 of 7 people trained to process and manage LiA member loans. Those who were left with loans training were heaped with mountains of new community management responsibilities on their plates. Everything related to the loans program seemed upside down and got out of synch for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Most LiA borrowers experienced<\/b> a 1-3 month period after the September events \r\nwhen payments due to them from the Invisible Children bracelet project were \r\ndelayed. Many fell into <b>arrears on their loans<\/b> at that time. In most (but not \r\nall) of those cases, those arrears have now been paid up to date. However, in \r\nthe wake of September's disruption, the paper files for the loan program were \r\nalso left in disarray and the computerized records were gone. It took over 3 months \r\nfor David Ewaku, a Life in Africa Board Member, to reconstruct the records and \r\nget the partnerships with Kiva (esp. online) and Invisible Children somewhat \r\nback on track, so that <b>by January 2007 loan payments were coming in smoothly again<\/b>. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, part of why it took so long was that David fell very ill and has \r\nbeen in and out of <b>hospital<\/b> since November. By then, however, we had hired a recent MBA grad with experience in microfinance \r\nas full time accounts manager for the Life in Africa community. Yet another \r\ndisaster - the <b>new accounts manager<\/b> took over David's updated loan program records, and proceeded \r\nthrough <b>professional incompetence<\/b> to make a complete mess of them over the next 4 months. She \r\nresigned in mid-March 2007 after receiving a warning letter from the community operations team about her performance. \r\nWe now find ourselves consulting 3 different sources of information that are \r\nriddled with holes and mistakes in order to get an accurate picture of what our \r\nborrowers have actually paid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a recent telephone discussion with Kiva staff about the apparent arrears in our loan portfolio, and with me hosting meetings in my home and participating in an advisory team for organizing Kiva's forthcoming ground-truthing efforts in East Africa this past week, we at LiA have been feeling a very keen sense of urgency about updating our payments on the Kiva website. Luckily, the community has Grace - our star community leader\/borrower who is  \r\nfeatured in the PBS Frontline segment about Kiva. Over the past 2 years, she \r\nhas dedicated her heart and soul to uplifting Life in Africa's communities in \r\nboth Kampala and Gulu. Though she is no accountant, <b>Grace Ayaa has now committed herself to taking the LiA loan program's administrative challenges by the horns<\/b>. <br><br>Over the past 2 weeks Grace has been working with a small group of community \r\nmembers to figure out how to reconstruct the community's loan program records, so that more than \r\none person understands the process that's been used and everyone can agree on \r\nthe final updated report. I can see she is very determined to do this transparently and am grateful on \r\nbehalf of the LiA community to Grace for the leadership she's investing in \r\ngetting our payment and loan tracking system straight and systemized once and \r\nfor all.  In fact, she  had hoped to finish everything before leaving for a short trip to Gulu this \r\nmorning. Instead, <b>Grace and her group of committee members have asked me to appeal \r\ndirectly for lenders' patience<\/b>. They feel that getting this sorted out \r\nright means it should not be approached in haste - they need more time to talk to the borrowers one by one to compare their records & recollections with the office records to get an accurate final picture of where each member stands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\r\n<b><u>PLEASE NOTE:<\/u> To avoid that ALL of our members' online \r\nrecords are negatively affected any further by this internal administrative \r\ncrisis, we are today marking all scheduled member loan payments as paid up to \r\nthis month on the Kiva website. <\/b> The amount paid on each account has been determined by the Kiva bulk-payments  feature as the scheduled amount outstanding due to Kiva.

However, in \r\nthe wake of September's disruption, the paper files for the loan program were \r\nalso left in disarray and the computerized records were gone. It took over 3 months \r\nfor David Ewaku, a Life in Africa Board Member, to reconstruct the records and \r\nget the partnerships with Kiva (esp. online) and Invisible Children somewhat \r\nback on track, so that <b>by January 2007 loan payments were coming in smoothly again<\/b>. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, part of why it took so long was that David fell very ill and has \r\nbeen in and out of <b>hospital<\/b> since November. By then, however, we had hired a recent MBA grad with experience in microfinance \r\nas full time accounts manager for the Life in Africa community. Yet another \r\ndisaster - the <b>new accounts manager<\/b> took over David's updated loan program records, and proceeded \r\nthrough <b>professional incompetence<\/b> to make a complete mess of them over the next 4 months. She \r\nresigned in mid-March 2007 after receiving a warning letter from the community operations team about her performance. \r\nWe now find ourselves consulting 3 different sources of information that are \r\nriddled with holes and mistakes in order to get an accurate picture of what our \r\nborrowers have actually paid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a recent telephone discussion with Kiva staff about the apparent arrears in our loan portfolio, and with me hosting meetings in my home and participating in an advisory team for organizing Kiva's forthcoming ground-truthing efforts in East Africa this past week, we at LiA have been feeling a very keen sense of urgency about updating our payments on the Kiva website. Luckily, the community has Grace - our star community leader\/borrower who is  \r\nfeatured in the PBS Frontline segment about Kiva. Over the past 2 years, she \r\nhas dedicated her heart and soul to uplifting Life in Africa's communities in \r\nboth Kampala and Gulu. Though she is no accountant, <b>Grace Ayaa has now committed herself to taking the LiA loan program's administrative challenges by the horns<\/b>. <br><br>Over the past 2 weeks Grace has been working with a small group of community \r\nmembers to figure out how to reconstruct the community's loan program records, so that more than \r\none person understands the process that's been used and everyone can agree on \r\nthe final updated report. I can see she is very determined to do this transparently and am grateful on \r\nbehalf of the LiA community to Grace for the leadership she's investing in \r\ngetting our payment and loan tracking system straight and systemized once and \r\nfor all.  In fact, she  had hoped to finish everything before leaving for a short trip to Gulu this \r\nmorning. Instead, <b>Grace and her group of committee members have asked me to appeal \r\ndirectly for lenders' patience<\/b>. They feel that getting this sorted out \r\nright means it should not be approached in haste - they need more time to talk to the borrowers one by one to compare their records & recollections with the office records to get an accurate final picture of where each member stands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\r\n<b><u>PLEASE NOTE:<\/u> To avoid that ALL of our members' online \r\nrecords are negatively affected any further by this internal administrative \r\ncrisis, we are today marking all scheduled member loan payments as paid up to \r\nthis month on the Kiva website. <\/b> The amount paid on each account has been determined by the Kiva bulk-payments  feature as the scheduled amount outstanding due to Kiva. Our community has, after all, guaranteed that \r\neach of these loans will be fully repaid to the lenders, regardless of each borrower's actual performance. Nonetheless, once we have all of this sorted out, we will update all of you (hopefully with next month's payments) on the accurate situation for your borrower with a link to the full \r\nand actual member repayment records for all loans guaranteed by the LiA \r\ncommunity in 2006. <b>In the cases where payments posted on Kiva were already up to date, I have posted a $1 payment to be able to alert all of our lenders to this message.<\/b> <br>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\nI humbly hope you can <b>forgive us at LiA for not communicating with lenders earlier about the challenges<\/b> we've faced in keeping the payments on Kiva accurately recorded, and thank you for your continued patience as the community works in good faith to get the mess sorted out.  It is likely Kiva will be sending a Kiva Fellow to work with us during the summer months, which - combined with the lessons we've already learned - will undoubtedly help us stay on a better track as we now begin raising loan funds for more members in both Kampala and Gulu. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, any <b>lenders with constructive support to offer, or with an interest in volunteering<\/b> with our microfinance program in Uganda, are most welcome to join us in dialogue at the Omidyar.net communuty and contact Grace Ayaa online at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.omidyar.net\/group\/lia\/\">http:\/\/www.omidyar.net\/group\/lia\/<\/a>.

It took over 3 months \r\nfor David Ewaku, a Life in Africa Board Member, to reconstruct the records and \r\nget the partnerships with Kiva (esp. online) and Invisible Children somewhat \r\nback on track, so that <b>by January 2007 loan payments were coming in smoothly again<\/b>. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, part of why it took so long was that David fell very ill and has \r\nbeen in and out of <b>hospital<\/b> since November. By then, however, we had hired a recent MBA grad with experience in microfinance \r\nas full time accounts manager for the Life in Africa community. Yet another \r\ndisaster - the <b>new accounts manager<\/b> took over David's updated loan program records, and proceeded \r\nthrough <b>professional incompetence<\/b> to make a complete mess of them over the next 4 months. She \r\nresigned in mid-March 2007 after receiving a warning letter from the community operations team about her performance. \r\nWe now find ourselves consulting 3 different sources of information that are \r\nriddled with holes and mistakes in order to get an accurate picture of what our \r\nborrowers have actually paid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a recent telephone discussion with Kiva staff about the apparent arrears in our loan portfolio, and with me hosting meetings in my home and participating in an advisory team for organizing Kiva's forthcoming ground-truthing efforts in East Africa this past week, we at LiA have been feeling a very keen sense of urgency about updating our payments on the Kiva website, but the current state of the payment records is discouraging. Luckily, the community has Grace - our star community leader\/borrower who is  \r\nfeatured in the PBS Frontline segment about Kiva. Over the past 2 years, she \r\nhas dedicated her heart and soul to uplifting Life in Africa's communities in \r\nboth Kampala and Gulu. Though she is no accountant, <b>Grace Ayaa has now committed herself to taking the LiA loan program's administrative challenges by the horns<\/b>. <br><br>Over the past 2 weeks Grace has been working with a small group of community \r\nmembers to figure out how to reconstruct the community's loan program records, so that more than \r\none person understands the process that's been used and everyone can agree on \r\nthe final updated report. I can see she is very determined to do this transparently and am grateful on \r\nbehalf of the LiA community to Grace for the leadership she's investing in \r\ngetting our payment and loan tracking system straight and systemized once and \r\nfor all.  In fact, she  had hoped to finish everything before leaving for a short trip to Gulu this \r\nmorning. Instead, <b>Grace and her group of committee members have asked me to appeal \r\ndirectly for lenders' patience<\/b>. They feel that getting this sorted out \r\nright means it should not be approached in haste - they need more time to talk to the borrowers one by one to compare their records & recollections with the office records to get an accurate final picture of where each member stands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\r\n<b><u>PLEASE NOTE:<\/u> To avoid that ALL of our members' online \r\nrecords are negatively affected any further by this internal administrative \r\ncrisis, we are today marking all scheduled member loan payments as paid up to \r\nthis month on the Kiva website. <\/b> The amount paid on each account has been determined by the Kiva bulk-payments  feature as the scheduled amount outstanding due to Kiva. Our community has, after all, guaranteed that \r\neach of these loans will be fully repaid to the lenders, regardless of each borrower's actual performance. Nonetheless, once we have all of this sorted out, we will update all of you (hopefully with next month's payments) on the accurate situation for your borrower with a link to the full \r\nand actual member repayment records for all loans guaranteed by the LiA \r\ncommunity in 2006. <b>In the cases where payments posted on Kiva were already up to date, I have posted a $1 payment to be able to alert all of our lenders to this message.<\/b> <br>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\nI humbly hope you can <b>forgive us at LiA for not communicating with lenders earlier about the challenges<\/b> we've faced in keeping the payments on Kiva accurately recorded, and thank you for your continued patience as the community works in good faith to get the mess sorted out.  It is likely Kiva will be sending a Kiva Fellow to work with us during the summer months, which - combined with the lessons we've already learned - will undoubtedly help us stay on a better track as we now begin raising loan funds for more members in both Kampala and Gulu. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, any <b>lenders with constructive support to offer, or with an interest in volunteering<\/b> with our microfinance program in Uganda, are most welcome to join us in dialogue at the Omidyar.net communuty and contact Grace Ayaa online at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.omidyar.net\/group\/lia\/\">http:\/\/www.omidyar.net\/group\/lia\/<\/a>.

Among the staff lost during all the disruption at that time included 4 of 7 people trained to process and manage LiA member loans. Those who were left with loans training were heaped with mountains of new community management responsibilities on their plates. Everything related to the loans program seemed upside down and got out of synch for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Most LiA borrowers experienced<\/b> a 1-3 month period after the September events \r\nwhen payments due to them from the Invisible Children bracelet project were \r\ndelayed.

With her revenues from one day, Yesenia will buy fish for the next, but she would like to expand her offering by taking out a $365 loan. She wants to buy seafood like fish, shrimp, and shellfish like crab and scallops. This microloan will allow Yesenia to buy in cash, whereas now she currently purchases goods on credit for a one-day period and pays nearly double to settle the debt. She wants to strengthen her business and build a board with which she can display her fish. One of the side benefits of making more profit is that Yesenia can save enough money to fix the roof of her house and send her children to a better school. <\/span><\/p>  "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":707,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase more diverse supply of fish; Market products better with display case","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Guayaquil","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.166667 -79.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2006-07-12T00:51:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yesenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2006-07-27T02:15:12Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":375,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2006-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2006-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2006-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2006-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2006-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2007-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2006-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2006-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2006-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2007-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2007-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2007-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":31,"local_amount":31,"processed_date":"2006-08-27T21:29:22Z","settlement_date":"2007-01-26T08:30:09Z","rounded_local_amount":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":1012,"comment":"Grupo solidario pago quincenal"},{"amount":31,"local_amount":31,"processed_date":"2006-08-27T21:35:04Z","settlement_date":"2007-01-26T08:30:09Z","rounded_local_amount":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":1014,"comment":"pago de la segunda quincena Grupo solidario"},{"amount":64,"local_amount":64,"processed_date":"2006-09-30T03:57:03Z","settlement_date":"2007-01-26T08:30:09Z","rounded_local_amount":64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":1447,"comment":null},{"amount":63,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2006-10-21T22:29:58Z","settlement_date":"2007-01-26T08:30:09Z","rounded_local_amount":63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":1916,"comment":"Pago de las 2 Quincenas del credito grupal(trabajando venceremos)"},{"amount":63,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2006-11-17T16:05:54Z","settlement_date":"2007-01-26T08:30:09Z","rounded_local_amount":63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":2433,"comment":null},{"amount":63,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2006-12-17T10:30:53Z","settlement_date":"2007-01-26T08:30:09Z","rounded_local_amount":63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":3307,"comment":"scheduled payment"},{"amount":60,"local_amount":60,"processed_date":"2007-01-26T08:30:09Z","settlement_date":"2007-01-26T08:30:09Z","rounded_local_amount":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5345,"comment":"scheduled payment"}],"funded_date":"2006-07-13T02:15:12Z","paid_date":"2007-01-26T08:30:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":528,"name":"Mercis","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"  <p style=\"text-align: justify\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Mercis R., who was born in <\/span><span>Esmeralda<\/span><span>, <\/span><span>Ecuador<\/span><span> has lived in <\/span><span>Guayaquil<\/span><span> for 10 years.

In an effort to model a high standard of \r\nthe transparency we operating in Africa should uphold online, this \r\nrather long message contains details that are relevant to helping you \r\nunderstand what's already happened, and what's happening now in the Life in Africa community with regard to this \r\nissue. Rest assured, Kiva staff are aware of these issues and some have \r\npersonally met, face to face, a number of the personalities involved. We at LiA feel it's now high time to let you - our valued lenders - in on the sensitive nature of the challenges we've been dealing with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn September 2006, <b>some LiA community members<\/b> tasked to manage the loan program \r\nand the Invisible Children bracelet campaign <b>resigned amidst accusations of \r\nmismanagement<\/b> from other members in the Life in Africa community. In the process, which was painful but arguably very healthy for the community in important ways,  \r\na laptop was stolen that included the records for both programs, the WE Center \r\nwas closed for 2 weeks, and management of the invisible children project shifted \r\nto another site, taking 35 (of 80) Life in Africa members involved in the \r\nproject with them to be full time employees. Among the staff lost during all the disruption at that time included 4 of 7 people trained to process and manage LiA member loans. Those who were left with loans training were heaped with mountains of new community management responsibilities on their plates. Everything related to the loans program seemed upside down and got out of synch for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Most LiA borrowers experienced<\/b> a 1-3 month period after the September events \r\nwhen payments due to them from the Invisible Children bracelet project were \r\ndelayed. Many fell into <b>arrears on their loans<\/b> at that time. In most (but not \r\nall) of those cases, those arrears have now been paid up to date. However, in \r\nthe wake of September's disruption, the paper files for the loan program were \r\nalso left in disarray and the computerized records were gone. It took over 3 months \r\nfor David Ewaku, a Life in Africa Board Member, to reconstruct the records and \r\nget the partnerships with Kiva (esp. online) and Invisible Children somewhat \r\nback on track, so that <b>by January 2007 loan payments were coming in smoothly again<\/b>. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, part of why it took so long was that David fell very ill and has \r\nbeen in and out of <b>hospital<\/b> since November. By then, however, we had hired a recent MBA grad with experience in microfinance \r\nas full time accounts manager for the Life in Africa community. Yet another \r\ndisaster - the <b>new accounts manager<\/b> took over David's updated loan program records, and proceeded \r\nthrough <b>professional incompetence<\/b> to make a complete mess of them over the next 4 months. She \r\nresigned in mid-March 2007 after receiving a warning letter from the community operations team about her performance. \r\nWe now find ourselves consulting 3 different sources of information that are \r\nriddled with holes and mistakes in order to get an accurate picture of what our \r\nborrowers have actually paid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a recent telephone discussion with Kiva staff about the apparent arrears in our loan portfolio, and with me hosting meetings in my home and participating in an advisory team for organizing Kiva's forthcoming ground-truthing efforts in East Africa this past week, we at LiA have been feeling a very keen sense of urgency about updating our payments on the Kiva website. Luckily, the community has Grace - our star community leader\/borrower who is  \r\nfeatured in the PBS Frontline segment about Kiva. Over the past 2 years, she \r\nhas dedicated her heart and soul to uplifting Life in Africa's communities in \r\nboth Kampala and Gulu. Though she is no accountant, <b>Grace Ayaa has now committed herself to taking the LiA loan program's administrative challenges by the horns<\/b>. <br><br>Over the past 2 weeks Grace has been working with a small group of community \r\nmembers to figure out how to reconstruct the community's loan program records, so that more than \r\none person understands the process that's been used and everyone can agree on \r\nthe final updated report. I can see she is very determined to do this transparently and am grateful on \r\nbehalf of the LiA community to Grace for the leadership she's investing in \r\ngetting our payment and loan tracking system straight and systemized once and \r\nfor all.  In fact, she  had hoped to finish everything before leaving for a short trip to Gulu this \r\nmorning. Instead, <b>Grace and her group of committee members have asked me to appeal \r\ndirectly for lenders' patience<\/b>. They feel that getting this sorted out \r\nright means it should not be approached in haste - they need more time to talk to the borrowers one by one to compare their records & recollections with the office records to get an accurate final picture of where each member stands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\r\n<b><u>PLEASE NOTE:<\/u> To avoid that ALL of our members' online \r\nrecords are negatively affected any further by this internal administrative \r\ncrisis, we are today marking all scheduled member loan payments as paid up to \r\nthis month on the Kiva website. <\/b> The amount paid on each account has been determined by the Kiva bulk-payments  feature as the scheduled amount outstanding due to Kiva. Our community has, after all, guaranteed that \r\neach of these loans will be fully repaid to the lenders, regardless of each borrower's actual performance.

In an effort to model a high standard of \r\nthe transparency we operating in Africa should uphold online, this \r\nrather long message contains details that are relevant to helping you \r\nunderstand what's already happened, and what's happening now in the Life in Africa community with regard to this \r\nissue. Rest assured, Kiva staff are aware of these issues and some have \r\npersonally met, face to face, a number of the personalities involved. We at LiA feel it's now high time to let you - our valued lenders - in on the sensitive nature of the challenges we've been dealing with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn September 2006, <b>some LiA community members<\/b> tasked to manage the loan program \r\nand the Invisible Children bracelet campaign <b>resigned amidst accusations of \r\nmismanagement<\/b> from other members in the Life in Africa community. In the process, which was painful but arguably very healthy for the community in important ways,  \r\na laptop was stolen that included the records for both programs, the WE Center \r\nwas closed for 2 weeks, and management of the invisible children project shifted \r\nto another site, taking 35 (of 80) Life in Africa members involved in the \r\nproject with them to be full time employees. Among the staff lost during all the disruption at that time included 4 of 7 people trained to process and manage LiA member loans. Those who were left with loans training were heaped with mountains of new community management responsibilities on their plates. Everything related to the loans program seemed upside down and got out of synch for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Most LiA borrowers experienced<\/b> a 1-3 month period after the September events \r\nwhen payments due to them from the Invisible Children bracelet project were \r\ndelayed. Many fell into <b>arrears on their loans<\/b> at that time. In most (but not \r\nall) of those cases, those arrears have now been paid up to date. However, in \r\nthe wake of September's disruption, the paper files for the loan program were \r\nalso left in disarray and the computerized records were gone. It took over 3 months \r\nfor David Ewaku, a Life in Africa Board Member, to reconstruct the records and \r\nget the partnerships with Kiva (esp. online) and Invisible Children somewhat \r\nback on track, so that <b>by January 2007 loan payments were coming in smoothly again<\/b>. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, part of why it took so long was that David fell very ill and has \r\nbeen in and out of <b>hospital<\/b> since November. By then, however, we had hired a recent MBA grad with experience in microfinance \r\nas full time accounts manager for the Life in Africa community. Yet another \r\ndisaster - the <b>new accounts manager<\/b> took over David's updated loan program records, and proceeded \r\nthrough <b>professional incompetence<\/b> to make a complete mess of them over the next 4 months. She \r\nresigned in mid-March 2007 after receiving a warning letter from the community operations team about her performance. \r\nWe now find ourselves consulting 3 different sources of information that are \r\nriddled with holes and mistakes in order to get an accurate picture of what our \r\nborrowers have actually paid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a recent telephone discussion with Kiva staff about the apparent arrears in our loan portfolio, and with me hosting meetings in my home and participating in an advisory team for organizing Kiva's forthcoming ground-truthing efforts in East Africa this past week, we at LiA have been feeling a very keen sense of urgency about updating our payments on the Kiva website. Luckily, the community has Grace - our star community leader\/borrower who is  \r\nfeatured in the PBS Frontline segment about Kiva. Over the past 2 years, she \r\nhas dedicated her heart and soul to uplifting Life in Africa's communities in \r\nboth Kampala and Gulu. Though she is no accountant, <b>Grace Ayaa has now committed herself to taking the LiA loan program's administrative challenges by the horns<\/b>. <br><br>Over the past 2 weeks Grace has been working with a small group of community \r\nmembers to figure out how to reconstruct the community's loan program records, so that more than \r\none person understands the process that's been used and everyone can agree on \r\nthe final updated report. I can see she is very determined to do this transparently and am grateful on \r\nbehalf of the LiA community to Grace for the leadership she's investing in \r\ngetting our payment and loan tracking system straight and systemized once and \r\nfor all.  In fact, she  had hoped to finish everything before leaving for a short trip to Gulu this \r\nmorning. Instead, <b>Grace and her group of committee members have asked me to appeal \r\ndirectly for lenders' patience<\/b>. They feel that getting this sorted out \r\nright means it should not be approached in haste - they need more time to talk to the borrowers one by one to compare their records & recollections with the office records to get an accurate final picture of where each member stands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\r\n<b><u>PLEASE NOTE:<\/u> To avoid that ALL of our members' online \r\nrecords are negatively affected any further by this internal administrative \r\ncrisis, we are today marking all scheduled member loan payments as paid up to \r\nthis month on the Kiva website. <\/b> The amount paid on each account has been determined by the Kiva bulk-payments  feature as the scheduled amount outstanding due to Kiva. Our community has, after all, guaranteed that \r\neach of these loans will be fully repaid to the lenders, regardless of each borrower's actual performance. Nonetheless, once we have all of this sorted out, we will update all of you (hopefully with next month's payments) on the accurate situation for your borrower with a link to the full \r\nand actual member repayment records for all loans guaranteed by the LiA \r\ncommunity in 2006. <b>In the cases where payments posted on Kiva were already up to date, I have posted a $1 payment to be able to alert all of our lenders to this message.<\/b> <br>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\nI humbly hope you can <b>forgive us at LiA for not communicating with lenders earlier about the challenges<\/b> we've faced in keeping the payments on Kiva accurately recorded, and thank you for your continued patience as the community works in good faith to get the mess sorted out.

Among the staff lost during all the disruption at that time included 4 of 7 people trained to process and manage LiA member loans. Those who were left with loans training were heaped with mountains of new community management responsibilities on their plates.

However, in \r\nthe wake of September's disruption, the paper files for the loan program were \r\nalso left in disarray and the computerized records were gone.

Luckily, the community has Grace - our star community leader\/borrower who is  \r\nfeatured in the PBS Frontline segment about Kiva. Over the past 2 years, she \r\nhas dedicated her heart and soul to uplifting Life in Africa's communities in \r\nboth Kampala and Gulu. Though she is no accountant, <b>Grace Ayaa has now committed herself to taking the LiA loan program's administrative challenges by the horns<\/b>. <br><br>Over the past 2 weeks Grace has been working with a small group of community \r\nmembers to figure out how to reconstruct the community's loan program records, so that more than \r\none person understands the process that's been used and everyone can agree on \r\nthe final updated report. I can see she is very determined to do this transparently and am grateful on \r\nbehalf of the LiA community to Grace for the leadership she's investing in \r\ngetting our payment and loan tracking system straight and systemized once and \r\nfor all.  In fact, she  had hoped to finish everything before leaving for a short trip to Gulu this \r\nmorning. Instead, <b>Grace and her group of committee members have asked me to appeal \r\ndirectly for lenders' patience<\/b>.

Our community has, after all, guaranteed that \r\neach of these loans will be fully repaid to the lenders, regardless of each borrower's actual performance. Nonetheless, once we have all of this sorted out, we will update all of you (hopefully with next month's payments) on the accurate situation for your borrower with a link to the full \r\nand actual member repayment records for all loans guaranteed by the LiA \r\ncommunity in 2006. <b>In the cases where payments posted on Kiva were already up to date, I have posted a $1 payment to be able to alert all of our lenders to this message.<\/b> <br>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\nI humbly hope you can <b>forgive us at LiA for not communicating with lenders earlier about the challenges<\/b> we've faced in keeping the payments on Kiva accurately recorded, and thank you for your continued patience as the community works in good faith to get the mess sorted out.

Kiva Lenders to Life in Africa borrowers in Uganda,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn behalf of Life in Africa's WE Center Kampala community I offer an <b>apology for the irregularities in posting our borrower repayments and journal updates to the Kiva \r\nwebsite<\/b> over the past several months. In an effort to model a high standard of \r\nthe transparency we operating in Africa should uphold online, this \r\nrather long message contains details that are relevant to helping you \r\nunderstand what's already happened, and what's happening now in the Life in Africa community with regard to this \r\nissue. Rest assured, Kiva staff are aware of these issues and some have \r\npersonally met, face to face, a number of the personalities involved. We at LiA feel it's now high time to let you - our valued lenders - in on the sensitive nature of the challenges we've been dealing with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn September 2006, <b>some LiA community members<\/b> tasked to manage the loan program \r\nand the Invisible Children bracelet campaign <b>resigned amidst accusations of \r\nmismanagement<\/b> from other members in the Life in Africa community. In the process, which was painful but arguably very healthy for the community in important ways,  \r\na laptop was stolen that included the records for both programs, the WE Center \r\nwas closed for 2 weeks, and management of the invisible children project shifted \r\nto another site, taking 35 (of 80) Life in Africa members involved in the \r\nproject with them to be full time employees. Among the staff lost during all the disruption at that time included 4 of 7 people trained to process and manage LiA member loans. Those who were left with loans training were heaped with mountains of new community management responsibilities on their plates. Everything related to the loans program seemed upside down and got out of synch for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Most LiA borrowers experienced<\/b> a 1-3 month period after the September events \r\nwhen payments due to them from the Invisible Children bracelet project were \r\ndelayed. Many fell into <b>arrears on their loans<\/b> at that time. In most (but not \r\nall) of those cases, those arrears have now been paid up to date. However, in \r\nthe wake of September's disruption, the paper files for the loan program were \r\nalso left in disarray and the computerized records were gone. It took over 3 months \r\nfor David Ewaku, a Life in Africa Board Member, to reconstruct the records and \r\nget the partnerships with Kiva (esp. online) and Invisible Children somewhat \r\nback on track, so that <b>by January 2007 loan payments were coming in smoothly again<\/b>. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, part of why it took so long was that David fell very ill and has \r\nbeen in and out of <b>hospital<\/b> since November. By then, however, we had hired a recent MBA grad with experience in microfinance \r\nas full time accounts manager for the Life in Africa community. Yet another \r\ndisaster - the <b>new accounts manager<\/b> took over David's updated loan program records, and proceeded \r\nthrough <b>professional incompetence<\/b> to make a complete mess of them over the next 4 months. She \r\nresigned in mid-March 2007 after receiving a warning letter from the community operations team about her performance. \r\nWe now find ourselves consulting 3 different sources of information that are \r\nriddled with holes and mistakes in order to get an accurate picture of what our \r\nborrowers have actually paid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a recent telephone discussion with Kiva staff about the apparent arrears in our loan portfolio, and with me hosting meetings in my home and participating in an advisory team for organizing Kiva's forthcoming ground-truthing efforts in East Africa this past week, we at LiA have been feeling a very keen sense of urgency about updating our payments on the Kiva website. Luckily, the community has Grace - our star community leader\/borrower who is  \r\nfeatured in the PBS Frontline segment about Kiva. Over the past 2 years, she \r\nhas dedicated her heart and soul to uplifting Life in Africa's communities in \r\nboth Kampala and Gulu. Though she is no accountant, <b>Grace Ayaa has now committed herself to taking the LiA loan program's administrative challenges by the horns<\/b>. <br><br>Over the past 2 weeks Grace has been working with a small group of community \r\nmembers to figure out how to reconstruct the community's loan program records, so that more than \r\none person understands the process that's been used and everyone can agree on \r\nthe final updated report. I can see she is very determined to do this transparently and am grateful on \r\nbehalf of the LiA community to Grace for the leadership she's investing in \r\ngetting our payment and loan tracking system straight and systemized once and \r\nfor all.  In fact, she  had hoped to finish everything before leaving for a short trip to Gulu this \r\nmorning. Instead, <b>Grace and her group of committee members have asked me to appeal \r\ndirectly for lenders' patience<\/b>.

In the process, which was painful but arguably very healthy for the community in important ways,  \r\na laptop was stolen that included the records for both programs, the WE Center \r\nwas closed for 2 weeks, and management of the invisible children project shifted \r\nto another site, taking 35 (of 80) Life in Africa members involved in the \r\nproject with them to be full time employees. Among the staff lost during all the disruption at that time included 4 of 7 people trained to process and manage LiA member loans. Those who were left with loans training were heaped with mountains of new community management responsibilities on their plates. Everything related to the loans program seemed upside down and got out of synch for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Most LiA borrowers experienced<\/b> a 1-3 month period after the September events \r\nwhen payments due to them from the Invisible Children bracelet project were \r\ndelayed.

However, in \r\nthe wake of September's disruption, the paper files for the loan program were \r\nalso left in disarray and the computerized records were gone. It took over 3 months \r\nfor David Ewaku, a Life in Africa Board Member, to reconstruct the records and \r\nget the partnerships with Kiva (esp. online) and Invisible Children somewhat \r\nback on track, so that <b>by January 2007 loan payments were coming in smoothly again<\/b>. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, part of why it took so long was that David fell very ill and has \r\nbeen in and out of <b>hospital<\/b> since November.

Yet another \r\ndisaster - the <b>new accounts manager<\/b> took over David's updated loan program records, and proceeded \r\nthrough <b>professional incompetence<\/b> to make a complete mess of them over the next 4 months. She \r\nresigned in mid-March 2007 after receiving a warning letter from the community operations team about her performance. \r\nWe now find ourselves consulting 3 different sources of information that are \r\nriddled with holes and mistakes in order to get an accurate picture of what our \r\nborrowers have actually paid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a recent telephone discussion with Kiva staff about the apparent arrears in our loan portfolio, and with me hosting meetings in my home and participating in an advisory team for organizing Kiva's forthcoming ground-truthing efforts in East Africa this past week, we at LiA have been feeling a very keen sense of urgency about updating our payments on the Kiva website, but the current state of the payment records is discouraging. Luckily, the community has Grace - our star community leader\/borrower who is  \r\nfeatured in the PBS Frontline segment about Kiva. Over the past 2 years, she \r\nhas dedicated her heart and soul to uplifting Life in Africa's communities in \r\nboth Kampala and Gulu. Though she is no accountant, <b>Grace Ayaa has now committed herself to taking the LiA loan program's administrative challenges by the horns<\/b>. <br><br>Over the past 2 weeks Grace has been working with a small group of community \r\nmembers to figure out how to reconstruct the community's loan program records, so that more than \r\none person understands the process that's been used and everyone can agree on \r\nthe final updated report. I can see she is very determined to do this transparently and am grateful on \r\nbehalf of the LiA community to Grace for the leadership she's investing in \r\ngetting our payment and loan tracking system straight and systemized once and \r\nfor all.  In fact, she  had hoped to finish everything before leaving for a short trip to Gulu this \r\nmorning. Instead, <b>Grace and her group of committee members have asked me to appeal \r\ndirectly for lenders' patience<\/b>. They feel that getting this sorted out \r\nright means it should not be approached in haste - they need more time to talk to the borrowers one by one to compare their records & recollections with the office records to get an accurate final picture of where each member stands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\r\n<b><u>PLEASE NOTE:<\/u> To avoid that ALL of our members' online \r\nrecords are negatively affected any further by this internal administrative \r\ncrisis, we are today marking all scheduled member loan payments as paid up to \r\nthis month on the Kiva website. <\/b> The amount paid on each account has been determined by the Kiva bulk-payments  feature as the scheduled amount outstanding due to Kiva. Our community has, after all, guaranteed that \r\neach of these loans will be fully repaid to the lenders, regardless of each borrower's actual performance. Nonetheless, once we have all of this sorted out, we will update all of you (hopefully with next month's payments) on the accurate situation for your borrower with a link to the full \r\nand actual member repayment records for all loans guaranteed by the LiA \r\ncommunity in 2006. <b>In the cases where payments posted on Kiva were already up to date, I have posted a $1 payment to be able to alert all of our lenders to this message.<\/b> <br>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\nI humbly hope you can <b>forgive us at LiA for not communicating with lenders earlier about the challenges<\/b> we've faced in keeping the payments on Kiva accurately recorded, and thank you for your continued patience as the community works in good faith to get the mess sorted out.  It is likely Kiva will be sending a Kiva Fellow to work with us during the summer months, which - combined with the lessons we've already learned - will undoubtedly help us stay on a better track as we now begin raising loan funds for more members in both Kampala and Gulu. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, any <b>lenders with constructive support to offer, or with an interest in volunteering<\/b> with our microfinance program in Uganda, are most welcome to join us in dialogue at the Omidyar.net communuty and contact Grace Ayaa online at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.omidyar.net\/group\/lia\/\">http:\/\/www.omidyar.net\/group\/lia\/<\/a>.

In an effort to model a high standard of \r\nthe transparency we operating in Africa should uphold online, this \r\nrather long message contains details that are relevant to helping you \r\nunderstand what's already happened, and what's happening now in the Life in Africa community with regard to this \r\nissue. Rest assured, Kiva staff are aware of these issues and some have \r\npersonally met, face to face, a number of the personalities involved. We at LiA feel it's now high time to let you - our valued lenders - in on the sensitive nature of the challenges we've been dealing with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn September 2006, <b>some LiA community members<\/b> tasked to manage the loan program \r\nand the Invisible Children bracelet campaign <b>resigned amidst accusations of \r\nmismanagement<\/b> from other members in the Life in Africa community. In the process, which was painful but arguably very healthy for the community in important ways,  \r\na laptop was stolen that included the records for both programs, the WE Center \r\nwas closed for 2 weeks, and management of the invisible children project shifted \r\nto another site, taking 35 (of 80) Life in Africa members involved in the \r\nproject with them to be full time employees. Among the staff lost during all the disruption at that time included 4 of 7 people trained to process and manage LiA member loans. Those who were left with loans training were heaped with mountains of new community management responsibilities on their plates. Everything related to the loans program seemed upside down and got out of synch for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Most LiA borrowers experienced<\/b> a 1-3 month period after the September events \r\nwhen payments due to them from the Invisible Children bracelet project were \r\ndelayed. Many fell into <b>arrears on their loans<\/b> at that time. In most (but not \r\nall) of those cases, those arrears have now been paid up to date. However, in \r\nthe wake of September's disruption, the paper files for the loan program were \r\nalso left in disarray and the computerized records were gone. It took over 3 months \r\nfor David Ewaku, a Life in Africa Board Member, to reconstruct the records and \r\nget the partnerships with Kiva (esp. online) and Invisible Children somewhat \r\nback on track, so that <b>by January 2007 loan payments were coming in smoothly again<\/b>. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, part of why it took so long was that David fell very ill and has \r\nbeen in and out of <b>hospital<\/b> since November. By then, however, we had hired a recent MBA grad with experience in microfinance \r\nas full time accounts manager for the Life in Africa community. Yet another \r\ndisaster - the <b>new accounts manager<\/b> took over David's updated loan program records, and proceeded \r\nthrough <b>professional incompetence<\/b> to make a complete mess of them over the next 4 months. She \r\nresigned in mid-March 2007 after receiving a warning letter from the community operations team about her performance. \r\nWe now find ourselves consulting 3 different sources of information that are \r\nriddled with holes and mistakes in order to get an accurate picture of what our \r\nborrowers have actually paid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a recent telephone discussion with Kiva staff about the apparent arrears in our loan portfolio, and with me hosting meetings in my home and participating in an advisory team for organizing Kiva's forthcoming ground-truthing efforts in East Africa this past week, we at LiA have been feeling a very keen sense of urgency about updating our payments on the Kiva website, but the current state of the payment records is discouraging. Luckily, the community has Grace - our star community leader\/borrower who is  \r\nfeatured in the PBS Frontline segment about Kiva. Over the past 2 years, she \r\nhas dedicated her heart and soul to uplifting Life in Africa's communities in \r\nboth Kampala and Gulu. Though she is no accountant, <b>Grace Ayaa has now committed herself to taking the LiA loan program's administrative challenges by the horns<\/b>. <br><br>Over the past 2 weeks Grace has been working with a small group of community \r\nmembers to figure out how to reconstruct the community's loan program records, so that more than \r\none person understands the process that's been used and everyone can agree on \r\nthe final updated report. I can see she is very determined to do this transparently and am grateful on \r\nbehalf of the LiA community to Grace for the leadership she's investing in \r\ngetting our payment and loan tracking system straight and systemized once and \r\nfor all.

He explained us he is going to buy for $250 of materials such as sand, cement, wood and zinc and hire two people from the community for 100,000 Riel ($25) for 1 week. He truly believes the works can be completed one single week after receiving the money from CREDIT.<\/font><\/p><p style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">I. Somoul is concerned about repaying her loan. She is self-employed and sells fruits and vegetable in a Market in Phnom Penh. She gets up early morning with her son and together they go to buy their fruits and vegetables at 4 am. She usually finishes at 5pm. She can make 20,000 Riel ($5) profit every day, while her son is making 10,000 Riel from taxi fares.<\/font><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":770,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"Improving the house","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Dangkao District","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":9,"posted_date":"2006-07-07T18:46:49Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Somoul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2006-07-28T20:47:47Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":300,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2006-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2006-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2006-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2006-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2006-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2007-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2007-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2007-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2007-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2007-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2007-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2007-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2006-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2006-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2006-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2007-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2007-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2007-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2007-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2007-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2007-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2006-09-01T01:43:25Z","settlement_date":"2007-05-28T01:45:29Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":1038,"comment":"July payment"},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2006-09-01T01:44:43Z","settlement_date":"2007-05-28T01:45:29Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":1039,"comment":"August Payment"},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2006-10-03T03:59:13Z","settlement_date":"2007-05-28T01:45:29Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":1476,"comment":"on time"},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2006-11-10T07:25:55Z","settlement_date":"2007-05-28T01:45:29Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":2213,"comment":"on time"},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2006-12-12T09:08:00Z","settlement_date":"2007-05-28T01:45:29Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":2974,"comment":"on time"},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2007-02-12T09:36:55Z","settlement_date":"2007-05-28T01:45:29Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":7221,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2007-02-23T08:50:49Z","settlement_date":"2007-05-28T01:45:29Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":7946,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2007-03-13T09:35:36Z","settlement_date":"2007-05-28T01:45:29Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10085,"comment":"on time"},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2007-05-28T01:45:29Z","settlement_date":"2007-05-28T01:45:29Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":17772,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2006-07-14T20:47:47Z","paid_date":"2007-05-28T01:45:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":558,"name":"Kaemorak","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\">W.

In an effort to model a high standard of \r\nthe transparency we operating in Africa should uphold online, this \r\nrather long message contains details that are relevant to helping you \r\nunderstand what's already happened, and what's happening now in the Life in Africa community with regard to this \r\nissue. Rest assured, Kiva staff are aware of these issues and some have \r\npersonally met, face to face, a number of the personalities involved. We at LiA feel it's now high time to let you - our valued lenders - in on the sensitive nature of the challenges we've been dealing with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn September 2006, <b>some LiA community members<\/b> tasked to manage the loan program \r\nand the Invisible Children bracelet campaign <b>resigned amidst accusations of \r\nmismanagement<\/b> from other members in the Life in Africa community. In the process, which was painful but arguably very healthy for the community in important ways,  \r\na laptop was stolen that included the records for both programs, the WE Center \r\nwas closed for 2 weeks, and management of the invisible children project shifted \r\nto another site, taking 35 (of 80) Life in Africa members involved in the \r\nproject with them to be full time employees. Among the staff lost during all the disruption at that time included 4 of 7 people trained to process and manage LiA member loans. Those who were left with loans training were heaped with mountains of new community management responsibilities on their plates. Everything related to the loans program seemed upside down and got out of synch for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Most LiA borrowers experienced<\/b> a 1-3 month period after the September events \r\nwhen payments due to them from the Invisible Children bracelet project were \r\ndelayed. Many fell into <b>arrears on their loans<\/b> at that time. In most (but not \r\nall) of those cases, those arrears have now been paid up to date. However, in \r\nthe wake of September's disruption, the paper files for the loan program were \r\nalso left in disarray and the computerized records were gone. It took over 3 months \r\nfor David Ewaku, a Life in Africa Board Member, to reconstruct the records and \r\nget the partnerships with Kiva (esp. online) and Invisible Children somewhat \r\nback on track, so that <b>by January 2007 loan payments were coming in smoothly again<\/b>. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, part of why it took so long was that David fell very ill and has \r\nbeen in and out of <b>hospital<\/b> since November. By then, however, we had hired a recent MBA grad with experience in microfinance \r\nas full time accounts manager for the Life in Africa community. Yet another \r\ndisaster - the <b>new accounts manager<\/b> took over David's updated loan program records, and proceeded \r\nthrough <b>professional incompetence<\/b> to make a complete mess of them over the next 4 months. She \r\nresigned in mid-March 2007 after receiving a warning letter from the community operations team about her performance. \r\nWe now find ourselves consulting 3 different sources of information that are \r\nriddled with holes and mistakes in order to get an accurate picture of what our \r\nborrowers have actually paid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a recent telephone discussion with Kiva staff about the apparent arrears in our loan portfolio, and with me hosting meetings in my home and participating in an advisory team for organizing Kiva's forthcoming ground-truthing efforts in East Africa this past week, we at LiA have been feeling a very keen sense of urgency about updating our payments on the Kiva website. Luckily, the community has Grace - our star community leader\/borrower who is  \r\nfeatured in the PBS Frontline segment about Kiva. Over the past 2 years, she \r\nhas dedicated her heart and soul to uplifting Life in Africa's communities in \r\nboth Kampala and Gulu. Though she is no accountant, <b>Grace Ayaa has now committed herself to taking the LiA loan program's administrative challenges by the horns<\/b>. <br><br>Over the past 2 weeks Grace has been working with a small group of community \r\nmembers to figure out how to reconstruct the community's loan program records, so that more than \r\none person understands the process that's been used and everyone can agree on \r\nthe final updated report. I can see she is very determined to do this transparently and am grateful on \r\nbehalf of the LiA community to Grace for the leadership she's investing in \r\ngetting our payment and loan tracking system straight and systemized once and \r\nfor all.  In fact, she  had hoped to finish everything before leaving for a short trip to Gulu this \r\nmorning. Instead, <b>Grace and her group of committee members have asked me to appeal \r\ndirectly for lenders' patience<\/b>.

In an effort to model a high standard of \r\nthe transparency we operating in Africa should uphold online, this \r\nrather long message contains details that are relevant to helping you \r\nunderstand what's already happened, and what's happening now in the Life in Africa community with regard to this \r\nissue. Rest assured, Kiva staff are aware of these issues and some have \r\npersonally met, face to face, a number of the personalities involved. We at LiA feel it's now high time to let you - our valued lenders - in on the sensitive nature of the challenges we've been dealing with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn September 2006, <b>some LiA community members<\/b> tasked to manage the loan program \r\nand the Invisible Children bracelet campaign <b>resigned amidst accusations of \r\nmismanagement<\/b> from other members in the Life in Africa community. In the process, which was painful but arguably very healthy for the community in important ways,  \r\na laptop was stolen that included the records for both programs, the WE Center \r\nwas closed for 2 weeks, and management of the invisible children project shifted \r\nto another site, taking 35 (of 80) Life in Africa members involved in the \r\nproject with them to be full time employees. Among the staff lost during all the disruption at that time included 4 of 7 people trained to process and manage LiA member loans. Those who were left with loans training were heaped with mountains of new community management responsibilities on their plates. Everything related to the loans program seemed upside down and got out of synch for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Most LiA borrowers experienced<\/b> a 1-3 month period after the September events \r\nwhen payments due to them from the Invisible Children bracelet project were \r\ndelayed. Many fell into <b>arrears on their loans<\/b> at that time. In most (but not \r\nall) of those cases, those arrears have now been paid up to date. However, in \r\nthe wake of September's disruption, the paper files for the loan program were \r\nalso left in disarray and the computerized records were gone. It took over 3 months \r\nfor David Ewaku, a Life in Africa Board Member, to reconstruct the records and \r\nget the partnerships with Kiva (esp. online) and Invisible Children somewhat \r\nback on track, so that <b>by January 2007 loan payments were coming in smoothly again<\/b>. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, part of why it took so long was that David fell very ill and has \r\nbeen in and out of <b>hospital<\/b> since November. By then, however, we had hired a recent MBA grad with experience in microfinance \r\nas full time accounts manager for the Life in Africa community. Yet another \r\ndisaster - the <b>new accounts manager<\/b> took over David's updated loan program records, and proceeded \r\nthrough <b>professional incompetence<\/b> to make a complete mess of them over the next 4 months. She \r\nresigned in mid-March 2007 after receiving a warning letter from the community operations team about her performance. \r\nWe now find ourselves consulting 3 different sources of information that are \r\nriddled with holes and mistakes in order to get an accurate picture of what our \r\nborrowers have actually paid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a recent telephone discussion with Kiva staff about the apparent arrears in our loan portfolio, and with me hosting meetings in my home and participating in an advisory team for organizing Kiva's forthcoming ground-truthing efforts in East Africa this past week, we at LiA have been feeling a very keen sense of urgency about updating our payments on the Kiva website, but the current state of the payment records is discouraging. Luckily, the community has Grace - our star community leader\/borrower who is  \r\nfeatured in the PBS Frontline segment about Kiva. Over the past 2 years, she \r\nhas dedicated her heart and soul to uplifting Life in Africa's communities in \r\nboth Kampala and Gulu. Though she is no accountant, <b>Grace Ayaa has now committed herself to taking the LiA loan program's administrative challenges by the horns<\/b>. <br><br>Over the past 2 weeks Grace has been working with a small group of community \r\nmembers to figure out how to reconstruct the community's loan program records, so that more than \r\none person understands the process that's been used and everyone can agree on \r\nthe final updated report. I can see she is very determined to do this transparently and am grateful on \r\nbehalf of the LiA community to Grace for the leadership she's investing in \r\ngetting our payment and loan tracking system straight and systemized once and \r\nfor all.  In fact, she  had hoped to finish everything before leaving for a short trip to Gulu this \r\nmorning. Instead, <b>Grace and her group of committee members have asked me to appeal \r\ndirectly for lenders' patience<\/b>. They feel that getting this sorted out \r\nright means it should not be approached in haste - they need more time to talk to the borrowers one by one to compare their records & recollections with the office records to get an accurate final picture of where each member stands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\r\n<b><u>PLEASE NOTE:<\/u> To avoid that ALL of our members' online \r\nrecords are negatively affected any further by this internal administrative \r\ncrisis, we are today marking all scheduled member loan payments as paid up to \r\nthis month on the Kiva website. <\/b> The amount paid on each account has been determined by the Kiva bulk-payments  feature as the scheduled amount outstanding due to Kiva. Our community has, after all, guaranteed that \r\neach of these loans will be fully repaid to the lenders, regardless of each borrower's actual performance. Nonetheless, once we have all of this sorted out, we will update all of you (hopefully with next month's payments) on the accurate situation for your borrower with a link to the full \r\nand actual member repayment records for all loans guaranteed by the LiA \r\ncommunity in 2006. <b>In the cases where payments posted on Kiva were already up to date, I have posted a $1 payment to be able to alert all of our lenders to this message.<\/b> <br>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\nI humbly hope you can <b>forgive us at LiA for not communicating with lenders earlier about the challenges<\/b> we've faced in keeping the payments on Kiva accurately recorded, and thank you for your continued patience as the community works in good faith to get the mess sorted out.  It is likely Kiva will be sending a Kiva Fellow to work with us during the summer months, which - combined with the lessons we've already learned - will undoubtedly help us stay on a better track as we now begin raising loan funds for more members in both Kampala and Gulu. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, any <b>lenders with constructive support to offer, or with an interest in volunteering<\/b> with our microfinance program in Uganda, are most welcome to join us in dialogue at the Omidyar.net communuty and contact Grace Ayaa online at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.omidyar.net\/group\/lia\/\">http:\/\/www.omidyar.net\/group\/lia\/<\/a>.
