is Vilma, 32, a resident of Baseco, Manila, Philippines. She is married to Felicito, a porter, and she is a mother to their three children. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their every day expenses.\r\n\r\nVilma operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns an income by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 300 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nVilma hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she dreams of giving her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work in her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and draws strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":871179,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Manila City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-09-16T22:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vilma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":4000.02,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:35:04Z","rounded_local_amount":4279.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232764628,"comment":null},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":3332.98,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:37:17Z","rounded_local_amount":3566.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238571749,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2667,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:31:57Z","rounded_local_amount":2853.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244529299,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-09-16T23:32:25Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T09:31:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":336111,"name":"Gerberta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gerberta is 50 years old and the mother of nine children.

is Leonila, 41, a resident of Baseco, Manila, Philippines. She is a single parent with two children. Together with her children, she manages their household while operating the business. She works hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nLeonila operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which sells groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns profit by buying supplies in bulk at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 300 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nLeonila hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she dreams to be able to give her children a good, high-quality education through her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.

With her eldest child already reaching adulthood and making a home of her own, Elinor had the extra space and converted an area into a studio. This allows her to save transportation and rental costs and precious time she had to allocate to reach the other locations. While a small number of clients will continue to have lessons at an outside studio, the majority of her business is relocating to her home-based studio.\r\n\r\nElinor needed this loan to purchase weights, exercise mats, pilates balls, and lighting fixtures and to create PR flyers.\r\n\r\nWhile a good number of Elinor's clients have moved to her home-based studio, she does still hold classes at outside studios.

is a 25-year-old married man from Lebanon who lives with his wife and two children. Two years ago, he opened a small shop where he started selling mobile phones, cosmetics, and perfumes. The young man's newly-started business needs so much support to move forward. So today, he is requesting to borrow $3000 from Kiva partner Al Majmoua to increase his store\u2019s inventory of recharge cards and to add necessary decoration to keep his shop attractive to new customers. This is Abbass' fourth cycle as Al Majmoua borrower. His previous loans reflected positively on his business growth and on his family's social and financial situations. He notes that the loan will help him fulfill his objectives and will positively impact his business growth and development the same way as the previous ones did.\r\nHis shop is located next to a hospital, which provides him with an increase in the number of customers, and is not dependent on the villagers and neighbors. He hopes to keep on expanding his business to provide his family with the good standard of living they deserve to

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nBelen operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Aside from this, she also earns additional income from a room that she offers to be rented in her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP  41,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nBelen hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she dreams to be able to give her children a good and high-quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and she can also draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":871333,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To pay for grocery items and products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Manila City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-09-17T14:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":950,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Belen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":41000,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":2733.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2733.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2733.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2733.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2733.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2733.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2733.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":2733.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":2733.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":2733.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":2733.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2733.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":2733.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2733.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":2733.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.34},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.34},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.34},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.34},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.34},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":190,"local_amount":8199.99,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:35:01Z","rounded_local_amount":8217.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232764634,"comment":null},{"amount":253.33,"local_amount":10933.01,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:37:16Z","rounded_local_amount":10955.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238571755,"comment":null},{"amount":253.34,"local_amount":10934,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:31:55Z","rounded_local_amount":10956.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244529305,"comment":null},{"amount":253.33,"local_amount":10933,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:39:04Z","rounded_local_amount":10955.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250738523,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-09-17T22:08:00Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T09:39:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":336219,"name":"Hailyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hailyn is married with 5 children.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a 5 PHP-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 600 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 35,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nNovie hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she dreams to be able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business.

is Daisy, 43, a resident of Manila, Philippines. She is married to Jacinto, a warehouse man, and mother to their five children.  Two are now studying in college. She, together with her husband and children, manage their own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nDaisy operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Aside from this, she also sells cooked viands and she earns additional income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a Php 20,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nDaisy hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she dreams of being able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business.

He is an open-minded person who says, \"I plan to sell my truck very soon and contribute to my business.\" He is requesting a 1,000,000 MNT loan to purchase new motorbikes for himself.

Jeanne Oueke Fran\u00e7oise is married to Yves, a teacher, and has four children, all of whom are studying and two of whom are in her care. She and her husband cover the various family expenses together. Jeanne Oueke Fran\u00e7oise left school at secondary level and then learnt dressmaking. She has been exercising this activity in her neighborhood for almost nine years. She also sells haberdashery products as a secondary activity, which allows her to provide her family's needs without any problem. Customer demand is becoming more and more significant, and in view of her limited means, Jeanne Oueke Fran\u00e7oise is no longer able to meet this demand. In view of this and their limited means, she and the other members of the Nougbognon 1 group are together requesting a loan from Alid\u00e9."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":871553,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"to buy haberdashery products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"9.5 2.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jeanne Oueke Fran\u00e7oise","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julienne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"H.

Juan has been farming for 55 years.  He learned this activity from his father when he was just 12 years old which kept him from going to school.\n\nJuan states that his prime objective is securing his family\u2019s food needs.  He has shown himself to be a very responsible person.  It\u2019s been 8 years now since he became a widower and was left in charge of providing education and nourishment for his two children.  Today, it\u2019s his two children that help him farm the land.\n\nDespite never having gone to school, Juan is a visionary man who struggles from sunup to sunup to be able to buy a piece of land to farm with his children in the future.  He has much faith that he\u2019ll accomplish this since his children share the same wish.\n\nJuan is asking Fundaci\u00f3n Campo for a loan to buy fertilizer and pesticides to be able to control infestations and crop diseases in his corn and bean plants that he planted during the last week in August.  With the loan, he\u2019ll be able to buy supplies at a better price and pay transportation costs just once to take them to his community.

She lives in her own home with her partner and their much loved daughter, 11 year old Keyli, who is Yobana's motivation for everything she does. Yobana had a deprived childhood which she managed to overcome with perseverance. By the age of 18 she was caring for herself independently. She left her job and started her own business - a grocery store - by selling her products while walking the streets. As time passed, and using what little savings she had, she managed to buy her own plot of land where her store is now located. She is not a woman to be reckoned with; that is to say, she is the kind of person who achieves her objectives through great effort and tenacity. These days she is happy with her business activities, her great charisma and her kindness in all her dealings. She has become a favourite with her neighbours, who have been her loyal clients since the early days of her business.

She is married to Eddie, 56, a \"jeepney\" (small public bus) driver, and a mother to seven children, three of whom are already settled and starting their own families, one studying in college, two in high school, and the youngest in elementary level. By the grace of God and with the help of her supportive husband, she can provide for the needs of her seven children. She is able to do so by means of the small business enterprises that she has ventured into.\r\n\r\nOne of her business ventures is a small computer arcade or video games rental. In the Philippines especially in urban poor communities, not all families can afford to buy personal computers, portable play stations, or equipment for video games. Children only enjoy this kind of amusement by renting at computer arcades and they pay per hour of usage. Alma has several play station units and she earns Php400 per day. \r\n\r\nAlma also operates a variety store adjacent to her house. It is a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. Alma earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her usual net profit per day is Php800 because her variety store includes mineral water and frozen products like hotdogs, ham, and sausages. \r\n\r\nAnother profitable business that she runs is a piggery. She buys several piglets, raises and fattens them, and sells them at their mature age and size. Her usual buyers are owners of meat stalls and slaughterhouses who sell the cut meat per kilo. From this third business, Alma usually earns Php180 a day.      \r\n\r\nTo help her continue running her businesses, she is requesting a Php 22,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy additional grocery items and beverages for her variety store, and some electronic devices for her computer arcade. As her businesses get bigger, she expects a boost in her business income and will be able to cover the family\u2019s needs, especially now that she is preparing for the college education of her two high school children.\r\n \r\nAlma hopes that her small variety store will expand into a mini-grocery, and that she can procure additional play station units to accommodate the children\u2019s demand, especially during summer and Christmas vacation. She also plans to expand her piggery, operate a slaughterhouse and own a meat stall in the market, so she can supply more pork in the community and compete with the commercialized pork dealers. In this way, she can make her meat price more affordable for her neighbors and friends. She works this hard to give her children a good future and to be a good testimony to the community. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":871941,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"     To

is Teresita, 58, a resident of Payatas, Quezon City, Philippines. She is married to Dioscoro, a construction worker. They are working hard to support their children who are now in college, because they know that education is quite important for their children\u2019s future and security.\r\n\r\nTeresita operates a variety store adjacent to their house. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Teresita earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Aside from this she also earn extra income from a direct sales business like AVON.  Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 300 in sales every day\r\n\r\nTo help her expand her business, she is requesting a Php 21,000 loan to buy additional grocery items, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. The loan will also ensure extra capital for her direct selling business, and she can offer more AVON products to her old and new customers. This will bring forth added income for the family and will improve their living conditions.\r\n\r\nTeresita dreams of expanding her business, possibly to a mini-grocery store. In this way she can give her children a good future and help them attain their dreams. She does not only hope for material things for her children, but most importantly she wants them to serve God and get involved in church ministry. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members every week to share her hopes and aspirations regarding her family.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":871944,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"     To

","en":"Alima is 46 years old.  She has one daughter and is also a guardian for her older sister's daughter.  Being the sole provider for the children and having to find sources for survival, Alima decided to start her own business of selling products of everyday demand in 1995 with a starting capital of 2,000 som (KGS).  Today, Alima's store yields a profit of about 15,000 som (KGS) per month and is famous for its affordable prices and also for samosas - baked stuffed pastries that she makes herself.  In order to further develop her business, Alima requested a loan in the sum of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to expand her assortment of products.  In the future, Alima plans to increase the number of store customers and increase the sales income."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1112.5,"image":{"id":871960,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"to broaden an assortment of goods","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Aydarken town","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2011-09-15T15:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"loan_amount":2225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2011-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2012-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2012-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":556.25},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":556.25},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":556.25},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":556.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":556.25,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:23:54Z","rounded_local_amount":25051.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244514686,"comment":null},{"amount":556.25,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:42:39Z","rounded_local_amount":25051.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263250571,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-09-26T15:56:48Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":336523,"name":"Toleujan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Toleujan is 34 years old and lives with his children and wife in a house in the Bayan-Ulgii province of Mongolia.

This is what occupies his daily schedule from 8am to 5pm. He usually earns about 300 PHP each day. \r\n\r\nHe wants to improve his services, which is why he is requesting a loan of 18,000 PHP. He will use the money to pay for franchise renewal and to purchase paint and side mirrors for his motorcycle. With the help of this loan, he will continue to operate the motorcycle in good condition. He would also ensure the safety of his passengers and himself.\r\n\r\nAriel would like to continue to provide an education for his children. He wants them to have successful lives and to pursue their chosen careers someday.

five children.  He is an economist by profession and spent his working career from 1976 through 1992 at the local collective farm.  Their father's vision and his active and fruitful work inspired Narynbek's children to obtain a higher education.  Two of his children - daughter Janyl and son Kutman became economists, and two other sons, Azamat and Jamanak, and daughter Aida became certified linguists.  Due to the fall of the collective farm system. Narynbek decided to start his own business of animal husbandry.  Persistent and tenacious Narynbek was able to develop his business to include 10 cows, 7 horses and 5 goats today.

With 45,000KGS in initial capital, he managed to turn his farm into a successful establishment with two horses, fifteen sheep, five goats, and a cow. Thanks to profits from managing the business, Karagul was able to help his children get their own houses. Nowadays, Karagul has income from selling milk and meat products on the order of 15,000KGS per month. \r\n\r\nKaragul has come to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 40,000KGS to buy two calves so he can increase his earnings, which he plans to use to do repairs on his house.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":419.45,"image":{"id":872091,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase cattle.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Chet - Nura village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2011-09-15T17:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Karagul","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":40000,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2978},{"due_date":"2011-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2985},{"due_date":"2011-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":3057},{"due_date":"2011-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":3131},{"due_date":"2012-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":3207},{"due_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":3284},{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3364},{"due_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3445},{"due_date":"2012-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3528},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3614},{"due_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3701},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3706}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.01},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.16},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.78},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.45},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.16},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.89},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.69},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.51},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.38},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.31},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.28},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.38}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":67.01,"local_amount":2978,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:28:51Z","rounded_local_amount":3019.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232751299,"comment":null},{"amount":67.16,"local_amount":2985,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:31:19Z","rounded_local_amount":3026.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238555523,"comment":null},{"amount":68.78,"local_amount":3057,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:24:10Z","rounded_local_amount":3099.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244514689,"comment":null},{"amount":70.45,"local_amount":3131,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:29:57Z","rounded_local_amount":3174.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250722492,"comment":null},{"amount":72.16,"local_amount":3207,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:41:26Z","rounded_local_amount":3251.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257125423,"comment":null},{"amount":73.89,"local_amount":3284,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:43:00Z","rounded_local_amount":3329.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263250574,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-09-15T22:27:33Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":336582,"name":"Adjoa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Adjoa is married and has 8 children.

Ama hopes to reinvest the new profit for further growth of the business.\r\n\r\nShe washes the palm fruit and boils them until they become soft and tender. She scoops the cooked fruit into a big mortar and gently pounds with a pestle to avoid damaging the nut. Water is then added to the pounded fruit. The mixture of water and the pounded fruit is squeezed and filtered to get the juice out and the chaff removed. The chaff is sometimes used by the local people to light charcoal fires. The juice is boiled again, and as it boils, the fresh oil will float to the surface of the pot. The oil is scooped into yet another pot and left to cool. \r\n\r\nFresh oil from palm fruit is traditionally used in eating roasted yam or plantains in Africa \u2013 especially on the farms after a hard day's work.
