is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Sus ventas las realiza de contado, pero su creciente y exigente clientela cada d\u00eda solicita mayor volumen y su peque\u00f1o capital de trabajo no es suficiente para satisfacerla, esta es la raz\u00f3n por la cual acude a su credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, con el cual comprar\u00e1 en mayor volumen pollo, huevos, y agregar\u00e1 contramuslo y pechuga principalmente, pues en la actualidad tienen mucha rotaci\u00f3n. Su sue\u00f1o es tener su propio local y ella est\u00e1 dirigiendo todos sus esfuerzos a ese prop\u00f3sito, mientras esto ocurre, es incansable en su trabajo y planea que sus ventas se incrementen en un 30%  y para ella y su familia, estos son nuevos ingresos","en":"\r\nMiladis, 47, owns a business called \u201cDistribuidora Miller\u201d where she sells chicken, chicken breasts, eggs, thighs, ham, mortadela and sausage.  \r\n\r\nMiladis lives in Soledad with her spouse and three children whose ages range from 13 to 25.  She started the business in 2009 because as an employee finding work was difficult and she felt the need to help meet household expenses which up to that point were totally her spouse\u2019s responsibility.\r\n\r\nBefore starting her business, Miladis asked around among her neighbors and discovered that selling whole chicken and chicken pieces would be a good option so she invested her small capital and started it at home.  It was so well received that she went on to rent a locale.  From this, she later on added egg and cured meats sales and this is how she is still to this day.\r\n\r\nHer sales are cash based but her growing and demanding clientele request more and more each day and her small working capital is insufficient to satisfy them.  This is why she\u2019s calling on a Kiva loan, the first financing she\u2019s gotten from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, to buy larger amounts of chicken and eggs adding thighs and breasts primarily because they are currently having much turnover.  \r\n\r\nHer dream is to own a locale and she\u2019s aiming all her efforts toward that end.  While this occurs, she is tireless in her work and plans to increase sales by 30% which represents new income for her and her family.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":258.58,"image":{"id":841103,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"to buy larger amounts of chicken and eggs adding breasts and thighs in particular.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad Atl\u00e0ntico","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-08-13T19:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Miladis Judith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":950000,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69951},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72505},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73895},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75311},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76755},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78226},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79725},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81253},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82811},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84398},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86016},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89154}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.5},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.97},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.79},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.6},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.43},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.29},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.16},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.04},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.94},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.87},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.79},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40.5,"local_amount":69951,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:02:15Z","rounded_local_amount":71681.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227320554,"comment":null},{"amount":41.98,"local_amount":72505,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:05:43Z","rounded_local_amount":74298.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232803719,"comment":null},{"amount":86.38,"local_amount":149206,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:59:24Z","rounded_local_amount":152896.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244568749,"comment":null},{"amount":44.43,"local_amount":76755,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:20:06Z","rounded_local_amount":78653.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257188470,"comment":null},{"amount":45.29,"local_amount":78226,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:36:18Z","rounded_local_amount":80161.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263324688,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-08-26T16:22:38Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":324689,"name":"Banco Comunal La Esperanza Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Se\u00f1ora Kenia Lizett es la presidenta del banco comunal la Esperanza.

Alina says that women\u2019s clothes are in bigger demand, so the major part of her merchandise is ladies' clothes and shoes. \r\n\r\n\r\nAlina says that her business allows her to keep her family, support her son in the army and also to pay for her daughter's education. This is Alina\u2019s 4th loan from Nor Horizon and now she is asking for a 600,000 AMD loan to buy a large lot of men\u2019s and women\u2019s jeans to resell. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":786.83,"image":{"id":841494,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To buy a large lot of men\u2019s and women\u2019s jeans to resell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AM","country":"Armenia","town":"Ijevan","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"40 45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":146,"posted_date":"2011-08-10T20:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"AMD","disbursal_amount":600000,"loan_amount":1650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":45870},{"due_date":"2011-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":46840},{"due_date":"2011-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":46780},{"due_date":"2011-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":48680},{"due_date":"2012-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":47930},{"due_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":50020},{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":50710},{"due_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":51020},{"due_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":51690},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":52750},{"due_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":53390},{"due_date":"2012-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":54320}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":126.14},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.81},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.65},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":133.87},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.81},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.55},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":139.45},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140.31},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.14},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.07},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.82},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":149.38}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":126.14,"local_amount":45870,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:58:21Z","rounded_local_amount":46232.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232866026,"comment":null},{"amount":128.81,"local_amount":46840,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T11:09:17Z","rounded_local_amount":47210.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238682060,"comment":null},{"amount":128.65,"local_amount":46790,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:53:22Z","rounded_local_amount":47159.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244637511,"comment":null},{"amount":133.87,"local_amount":48670,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T11:04:05Z","rounded_local_amount":49054.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250853907,"comment":null},{"amount":131.81,"local_amount":47930,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:31:32Z","rounded_local_amount":48308.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257263607,"comment":null},{"amount":137.55,"local_amount":50020,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:44:06Z","rounded_local_amount":50415.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263404784,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-08-26T05:38:10Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":324767,"name":"Gagik","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gagik was born in 1957 in Lorut village, Lori region.

region, where she graduated from high school and then from the Wine and Chemical Engineering College, where she received her degree in chemical engineering. \r\n\r\nNow, Goharik lives in Dovrus village and works in a rural community. Goharik is married and has a son and a daughter who are both married and live separately from their parents. Her husband works in the Zangezur Copper-Molybdenum Factory as a builder. \r\n\r\nFor many years Goharik has bred cattle and sheep and grown vegetables and fruit. Her son helps Goharik on the farm. Also, they rent a small plot of land where they graze their cows and sheep. \r\n\r\nGoharik and her family sell the vegetables and fruit they produce in the Kapan city market, and their beef, mutton, and milk they sell from their farm, often to buyers who take the products to the big city markets. \r\n\r\nDue to the work on the farm, Goharik and her family were able to purchase a truck with which they transport their produce from the farm to the city market. \r\n\r\nGoharik needs a loan of 1,000,000 drams to buy a few pigs, fodder for them, diesel fuel, and everything necessary to harvest hay.  \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":439.08,"image":{"id":841517,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":" to buy a few pigs, fodder for them, diesel fuel, and everything necessary to harvest hay.

He sets off at 4:30am to seek out customers along the city streets that need to be transported from place to place.  He\u2019s been in this line of work for 20 years, time in which he\u2019s learned quite a bit about the business.\r\n\r\nWhat he likes about his work is that he can manage his own time since he knows at what times passengers are plentiful and when he can go home to do chores there.  What he dislikes is that the sun is very strong and the state of the roads is such that his vehicle becomes damaged as do his kidneys.  He hopes later on to be able to buy another vehicle to lease it out and earn extra income.\r\n\r\nHe has been with the institution six years.  He says he likes to work with MFP because interest rates are low but, above all, because you can access a secure loan not just for yourself but for your family as well.  He will use the requested 1000 soles to buy some replacement parts for his mototaxi to improve the appearance of his work tool.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":842229,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","use":"to buy replacement parts for his mototaxi.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-08-14T17:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Guirmen Augusto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":153.51},{"due_date":"2011-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":155.79},{"due_date":"2011-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":163.18},{"due_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":167.55},{"due_date":"2011-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":177.37},{"due_date":"2012-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":182.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.57},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.42},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.19},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.83},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.52},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.47}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:12Z","rounded_local_amount":1027.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350855,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-08-19T08:41:17Z","paid_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":324871,"name":"Maria Simona","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda de 45 a\u00f1os de edad, vive con su esposa e hijos en su casa propia, no cuenta con servicios b\u00e1sicos, ubicado en la zona rural del distrito de M\u00f3rrope que pertenece al departamento de Lambayeque.

Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n \r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n \r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is 42 years old, married, and the father of seven children. He lives with his family in the district of Medina Coura, prefecture of Koutiala (in the Sikasso region).\r\n\r\nSocial issues having prevented him from pursuing his primary studies, he quickly became interested in income-generating activities as a child alongside his father. After attempting several activities without success, he started selling smoked fish 14 years ago. Smoked fish are in high demand in Koutiala.\r\n\r\nIn order to bolster his working capital and strengthen his selling power, he decided to join the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso nearly a year ago. This is his second individual loan with the MFI; the first one was repaid without incident. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Mr. Adama plans to buy five baskets of smoked fish in Korientz\u00e9 (in the Mopti region) from fishermen of Bozo and Somon\u00f4 ethnic backgrounds.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n \r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n \r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

\n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She has a large customer base composed of households in and around her area. She makes her purchases at Tokpa, the largest market in Benin. \r\n\r\nShe is now on her second loan which she requested and obtained at the micro-finance institution FINADEV to increase her business capital in order to diversify her businesses further.

includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
