Due to the fact that the harvest had to be shared with the landowner, Susana could only generate a small income and so decided to initiate a kiosk business at her house. With IDR 2,000,000 that she had, she bought some products to sell at her kiosk. As a widow, Susana has to work hard in her business to meet her family needs; moreover, she also needs to support her grandchild. <p>\r\n\r\nCurrently Susana plans to sell ice cube and mixed ice at her kiosk but needs a refrigerator to produce them.

She is a member of the Mujeres Forjadoras community bank, a group that is comprised of 10 members who own small businesses. Irma has been making and selling bed sheets, bedspreads, and slipcovers for a living for 24 years. She launched this business because she did not want to depend on her partner since he did not let her work and treated her badly. Consequently, Irma got a divorce and had to support her three children, so she set up the sewing shop in which she currently works. Irma states that it was not easy.

Arsenia has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 2000 PHP a month for these activities.\n\nIn 2009, Arsenia joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.

Arsenia is requesting a new loan of 14,900 PHP which will be used to purchase raw ingredients for her snack vending in the local community. This will be the 5th loan taken out by Arsenia from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \n\nAbout PMPC:\n\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

M., age 58, owns and operates a confectionery business. He lives in Sevan with his wife and son, and Albert\u2019s whole family contributes to the business, which consists of preparing and selling confectionery. Three years ago, Albert equipped a spot in the yard of his own house as a place for his new business endeavor. Before that, he worked as a builder in Russia, but then he decided to come back to his native land and start his family business. \r\n\r\nAt this point, his product is very popular in the entire Gegharkunik marz, whose centre is Sevan city. Albert provides many shops and school buffets with his confectionery, and while he was pleased that his business had expanded, he experienced difficulty delivering his product to such a large region. Therefore, with his first Kiva loan, Albert was able to buy a minibus for providing customers with his fresh products on time.  \r\n\r\nAlbert intends to diversify his product, so he is currently asking for a 600.000 AMD loan in order to buy the necessary equipment for the production of salty stick confectionery. \r\n

T., 50, aims for completeness in life.  Hermosa completed college and is single.  Together with her brother Robert, she manages her ornamental plants business and oversees an operation of renting out all party needs. They live in Pooc 2, Silang, Cavite, Philippines.\r\n\r\nHermosa has been raising and selling all kinds of flowers and ornamental plants for 10 years now.  She raises ornamental plants and flowers which are normally present at Filipino home gardens. She serves hobbyists, offices, schools and her local community.  Along with this business, she also manages a party rentals business.  She rents out tables, chairs, and balloons for parties. Every month, Hermosa earns an estimated net income of around 11,000 Philippine pesos (PHP).\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her businesses, she is requesting a 30,000 PHP loan.  She plans to use this to pay for additional sacks of fertilizers for her flower and ornamental plants farm.  She also intends to use part of this loan to buy new materials for her party rentals business.\r\n\r\nHermosa desires a successful business, a healthy body, and a peaceful and happy life. As a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group\u2019s weekly fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she received.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners and clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance

H. owns & operates a furniture making business where she makes & sells general household furniture to local businesses and community members. She has been engaged in this business for over 5 years and earns approximately 4.000.000 VND a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, H. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities.  She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6.496.000 VND from SEDA. This previous loan was used to purchase additional raw materials to expand her product offering. She is now requesting a new loan of 7.840.000 VND which will be used to purchase tools & other equipment to expand the business. This will be her 3rd loan from SEDA. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve\/expand her business.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout SEDA:\r\n\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to the low income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the Northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

H. has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6,496,000 VND from SEDA.  This previous loan was used to purchase machinery to expand the business.  H. is now requesting a new loan of 7,840,000 VND to purchase additional raw materials to expand product offerings.  The loan will be the third loan taken out by the borrower from SEDA.

R. is from the village of New Bethlehem, Liloy, Zamboanga del Norte.

The main source of income for the business comes from selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap & toothpaste in the local community. Marcela has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 2000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Marcela joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Marcela is requesting a new loan of 3000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products for her retail store. This will be the 1st loan taken out by Marcela from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

He learned this activity from his father, who was a well-respected mechanic.  He is very good at his work, having done this for the past 15 years. Prior to joining the microlending organization Soro Yiriwaso, Mr Sidib\u00e9 was struggling to maintain his business due to a lack of consistent funds. He decided to join the organization in order satisfy the demands of his customers to be able to grow his business. He is asking for a second loan from Soro Yiriwaso, after having reimbursed the first loan on time. \r\n\r\nThis loan would allow him to purchase a large quantity of spare parts from wholesalers and then re-sell either to retailers for cash.

children. He works selling and installing satellite dishes. He has ten years of experience in his field. He likes his work and believes that his business is rather unique for his community seeing as there aren't many satellite dish businesses there. He stands out in his field due to the large demand for his services. Still, Hassan always likes to develop and improve his business. With a loan from al-Majmoua, he would like to improve his store by buying new goods and equipment for it. In addition, he would like to install a water tank for his land since he farms on the side. With his farm, he is better able to provide for his children as he can grow natural foods for them to eat. He is very interested in the health of his family, and he would like to secure a respectable life for them. Moreover, he is also interested in providing them a good education and in raising them well."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":753087,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Electrical Goods","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy goods and equipment for his satellite dish store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"LB","country":"Lebanon","town":"Ain","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"33.833333 35.833333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":77,"posted_date":"2011-04-19T18:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hassan ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2011-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2011-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2012-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2012-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":130.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":130.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":124.5,"local_amount":124.5,"processed_date":"2011-05-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:23:46Z","rounded_local_amount":124.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211153856,"comment":null},{"amount":124.5,"local_amount":124.5,"processed_date":"2011-06-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:27:19Z","rounded_local_amount":124.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216438771,"comment":null},{"amount":124.5,"local_amount":124.5,"processed_date":"2011-07-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:06:47Z","rounded_local_amount":124.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221603462,"comment":null},{"amount":124.5,"local_amount":124.5,"processed_date":"2011-08-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:12:29Z","rounded_local_amount":124.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":226972889,"comment":null},{"amount":124.5,"local_amount":124.5,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:11:10Z","rounded_local_amount":124.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232731003,"comment":null},{"amount":124.5,"local_amount":124.5,"processed_date":"2011-10-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:13:16Z","rounded_local_amount":124.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238534544,"comment":null},{"amount":124.5,"local_amount":124.5,"processed_date":"2011-11-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:06:21Z","rounded_local_amount":124.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244494065,"comment":null},{"amount":124.5,"local_amount":124.5,"processed_date":"2011-12-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:09:03Z","rounded_local_amount":124.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250702164,"comment":null},{"amount":124.5,"local_amount":124.5,"processed_date":"2012-01-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:19:05Z","rounded_local_amount":124.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257299011,"comment":null},{"amount":379.5,"local_amount":379.5,"processed_date":"2012-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:19:10Z","rounded_local_amount":379.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263316956,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-05-16T19:17:49Z","paid_date":"2012-03-15T08:19:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":291277,"name":"Jane Wangui","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jane has been practising farming in Njabini town for the last three years.

Su cabello es corto y su color es casta\u00f1o. Se dedica a la producci\u00f3n y venta de empanadas, adem\u00e1s realiza productos de amasander\u00eda y reposter\u00eda. En febrero estuvo participando de una feria costumbrista, donde vendi\u00f3 sus productos. Ella se dedica a \u00e9ste rubro desde hace 4 a\u00f1os. Durante la semana y fin de semana se dedica a la producci\u00f3n de empanadas. Sin embargo son los fines de semana que le dan mayores ganancias.

Sobre Talca existe una curiosa referencia en Chile, la frase \"Talca, Par\u00eds, y Londres\". Entre los mitos al respecto, algunos dicen que es una derivaci\u00f3n de la originalmente dicha por un ingl\u00e9s \"Talca parece Londres\", por la abundante neblina que cubre frecuentemente la ciudad en la temporada invernal, a semejanza de la capital del Reino Unido.\n","en":"\r\nThis communal bank is called \u201cCrecer Unidos\u201d (To Grow Together). It has 15 entrepreneurs who are in a variety of businesses like: kiosks, clothing store, pastry making, bakery, textile workshop, auto repair shop, vegetable stand and an inn.  All of them are from the city of Talca.\r\n\r\nPatricia, who in the photo is seated in the front row second from the left, is wearing a violet jacket and brown sandals.  Her hair is short and dark brown.  She makes and sells turnovers and also makes baked goods and pastry.  In February she participated in a cultural fair where she sold her products.\r\n\r\nShe\u2019s been in this line of work for four years.  During the week and on weekends she makes the turnovers but weekends is when her profits are greatest.  Patricia sells her products based on prior orders from her customers and sometimes her sales are in excess of 200 turnovers.\r\n\r\nShe buys her ingredients at a minimarket and she buys the onions at wholesale.  She will use this loan to buy a stove because the one she\u2019s using now is in bad shape.  Her goal is to have an established locale to sell her bakery products and pastry.\r\n\r\nPatricia lives with her husband and children.  However, according her her husband\u2019s job requirements he sometimes has to be away from home for two week periods due to his work schedule.  One of her children helps her with her business since business and sales are enjoyable.\r\n\r\nPatricia\u2019s motivation to continue in business is to cover her daughter\u2019s university costs.  Besides, this business has served as therapy for her and has raised her spirits because she\u2019s been in treatment for cancer for the last five years.  She currently is going in for medical supervision and her state of mind is positive.\r\n\r\nShe is very grateful to Fondo Esperanza because of the easy loan terms that make it possible for her to invest in her business and generate more profits.  She very much enjoys taking part in the meetings because she learns with the training; besides she\u2019s learned how to apply the bookkeeping skills she\u2019s learned to her business.\r\n\r\nTalca is part of Maule Region in the central part of the country.  It is the administrative, economic and cultural center of the region since it\u2019s the most important city in the Chilean Central Valley.  There is an interesting phrase in Chile about Talca: \u201cTalca, Par\u00eds y Londres.\u201d Among the myths alluding to it some say that it comes from something an Englishman once said:  \u201cTalca seems like London\u201d (Talca parece Londres) because of the thick fog that frequently covers the city in winter like in the capital of the United Kingdom.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2700,"image":{"id":751182,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Today, she is requesting to borrow $1,000 from Kiva partner Ameen s.a.l. to purchase textiles and pearls in order to expand her business operation and earn more profit. This will be her second Kiva loan.

She makes leather and woven handicrafts and has been in this business for 10 years.  She makes clothes, accessories and soft furnishings.  Her models are exclusives as she also designs them.\r\n\r\nIsabel's workshop is located in her home and all her products are made to order.  She has a web page where she promotes and publicizes her handicrafts.  Her customers are mainly professionals who don't have a lot of time available to go to the stores and buy products.  For this reason, her system for promoting her products is aimed at them.  Isabel uses a Notebook to exhibit her merchandise and send catalogs on line.  She works alone in her business.\r\n\r\nIsabel buys some of her merchandise in a leather store and other supplies from a wholesaler.  She will use this loan to buy materials for making her handicrafts.  She will also send her two sewing machines to be repaired.  Her goal is to buy industrial sewing machines and an iPad so that she can better sell her products.\r\n\r\nIsabel lives together with her husband who helps her to move the machinery in her workshop.  Her motivation for continuing in her business is that she enjoys it and finds it therapeutic since she used to suffer from depression some years ago.  She is continuing to look after herself but her mood is favorable.\r\n\r\nIsabel is very happy and grateful for the loan that she has obtained from Fondo Esperanza since it means she will be able to invest in her business.  The meetings that she attends are very pleasant and she is also participating in some sales workshops which is making her very happy.\r\n\r\nTemuco is the capital of Araucania region.  The city is located 670 kilometers to the south of Santiago (the capital of Chile).  In the outlying areas there are a series of lakeside spas (Puc\u00f3n, Villarica) and very colorful native flora and fauna in nearby nature reserves.  This region is home to 50% of the Mapuches (the indigenous people of our country)."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":751131,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":"to buy materials to make her handicrafts and to send her two sewing machines to be repaired","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CL","country":"Chile","town":"Temuco","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-30 -71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":157,"posted_date":"2011-04-19T14:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-04-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CLP","disbursal_amount":154949,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":18174},{"due_date":"2011-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":18819},{"due_date":"2011-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":19055},{"due_date":"2011-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":19294},{"due_date":"2011-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19465},{"due_date":"2011-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":19835},{"due_date":"2011-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":20030},{"due_date":"2011-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":20277}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.05},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.51},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.04},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.58},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.97},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.8},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.25},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.8}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":126.6,"local_amount":56048,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:11:12Z","rounded_local_amount":59610.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211223395,"comment":null},{"amount":87.55,"local_amount":38759,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:03:03Z","rounded_local_amount":41222.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216502369,"comment":null},{"amount":90.05,"local_amount":39865,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:45:15Z","rounded_local_amount":42398.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221666366,"comment":null},{"amount":45.8,"local_amount":20277,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T09:05:48Z","rounded_local_amount":21565.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227035223,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-04-19T16:12:13Z","paid_date":"2011-09-15T09:05:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":291373,"name":"Progression Plus Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"\u201cProgression Plus\u201d is a community bank made up of 14 micro-entrepreneurs whose chairwoman is Micheline M..

As she can\u2019t afford to pay in advance for workers to help get rid of the weeds in the fields, she is seeking a loan from Kiva partner MFP to do this.

The most difficult part is dealing with the insects which infect the new shoots.\r\n\r\nWith the loan money Miryan plans to buy cocoa and coffee seeds, but her first priority is to buy more land so she can grow more crops. This is her first loan with Kiva partner MFP, and she knows that she must be punctual with the repayments if she wishes to get another loan in the future.

With a great deal of effort Nadya and her partner, Richard, have worked their land and they have made them very productive. She cultivates cocoa, coffee, and coca leaves. Once the harvest is done she takes the products to the collection centers in the cities of Santa Rosa and San Francisco for wholesale.  Her cultivations have provided her with enough funds to support themselves, which is why she wants to put her best into this business. The thing she most enjoys about her work is caring for her cultivations. She has 6 years in the business. The most difficult part of her work is having to transport her products, especially because the sacks are very heavy and she needs to hire help. She uses donkeys to carry the loads of products to the centers. With the funds that she requests she will purchase wheelbarrows to help transport her products. In the future she wants to buy ore land to increase production. This is her first loan with MFP (Kiva Field Partner). The loan that she requests will be of great help and she is happy with the introduction of the communal bank in her village.

She lives in her own home with her partner Ra\u00fal, 38, and their two beloved children, Frank who is 12 and Fiorella who is 9, who are the reason for all their efforts. The products that Virginia and her partner Ra\u00fal have been able to cultivate, with so much effort and dedication, have helped them greatly in their progress in life. Every morning she begins working the fields, since she knows the quality of the harvest will depend on the care she gives to her cocoa, coffee, annatto and coca leaf plantings. During harvest season she needs the support of day laborers who help her extract and transport the harvested products. What she most enjoys about her work is caring for the crops and she feels quite happy to see them grow large and abundant. She has worked in this line of business for five years and believes the most difficult aspect is carrying the harvested crops to collection centers located in the city of San Francisco [Peru] which is where she sells them. The sacks used to carry the crops are quite heavy and therefore she will be hiring transport. \r\n\r\nIn the future she would like to buy new land. This is her first loan with MFP. She knows she must make all her payments punctually and she is willing to do it. She is very happy to be a member of her communal bank. With the requested loan she will purchase cocoa and annatto seeds to increase her plantings by which she hopes to increase her future harvests.

Initially, they bought and sold foreclosed houses, but subsequently they moved into apartment management because of its efficiency (more tenants in one location) and financial stability.  They currently own one apartment building, and their goal for 2011 is to acquire two additional apartment buildings, each with a capacity of twenty-four or more units.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are each responsible for paying back the loan of their fellow group member if she is delinquent or defaults. \n\nEsa, 52 years old, married, and blessed with five grown children, earns a living by snack vending in the local community. Engaged in this business for 10 years, she earns an average of not less than P2,000.00 a month. \n\nIn 2006, Esa joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Having  repaid her previous loan, she is now requesting a third loan of Php6,000.00 to purchase raw ingredients for her snacks vending.\n\nAbout PMPC:\n\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model. \n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":747698,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Gina O. is from the village of Triunfo, Ozamiz City, Misamis Occidental. She is 33 years old. Gina is married to Elmer O. who\u2019s working as a security guard and they are blessed with one school-aged child. To make a living, she is presently engaged in a sari-sari (variety) store business. She is also receiving regular support from her husband as a guard. She has been engaged in this kind of business for over five years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nJust this year, Gina joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She is now requesting her 1rst loan of 40,000 PHP which will be used for the registration of their new motorcycle. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from that business to improve the general living conditions of her family especially for her basic needs, saving, insurance and possible business expansion.\r\n\r\n About PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model. \r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

lenders.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":886.45,"image":{"id":750360,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle

Together, they live in Biluso, Silang, Cavite, Philippines. \r\n\r\nGertrudes runs her own sari-sari (variety) store located in an extension of their house. Every day she observes the buying patterns of her customers and notes down their preferences in terms of the type of item they buy, the price, and the brand. She sees to it that her customers get what they prefer. Monthly, Gertrudes earns an estimated net income of around 11,000 Philippine pesos (PHP). \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting an 8,000 PHP loan. She intends to meet the demands of her customers. As needed, she will buy more stocks of rice, soft drinks, and other grocery items. \r\n\r\nGertrudes acknowledges that no challenges are too hard to deal with. She knows that the Lord will enable her to overcome and uphold the future of both her children and her business. She dreams of making her sari-sari store grow. As a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she received. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners and clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay micro-finance loans. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":753599,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy additional grocery items for her store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Silang, Cavite","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-04-20T14:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gertrudes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":533.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":53.33,"local_amount":2133.32,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:33:53Z","rounded_local_amount":2307.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206123599,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2666.65,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:49:35Z","rounded_local_amount":2884.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211194973,"comment":null},{"amount":53.33,"local_amount":2133.32,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:43:16Z","rounded_local_amount":2307.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216474057,"comment":null},{"amount":26.67,"local_amount":1066.71,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:31:41Z","rounded_local_amount":1154.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221636838,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-04-20T17:49:28Z","paid_date":"2011-08-15T08:31:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":291564,"name":"Candelaria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Candelaria is 31 years old and married with three children. \r\n\r\nCandelaria works hard to provide for her family.
