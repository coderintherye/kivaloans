is Flordelina N., a 42-year-old resident of Caloocan City, Philippines. She is married to Rodrigo N., an employee, and is the mother of three children, two of whom are already in college while the youngest is still in elementary school. By the grace of God, Flordelina has managed to support her older children's schooling up to the college level. At this time, she is working hard to send her youngest to college - a dream for most Filipino parents like Flordelina as she herself has been a college undergraduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents could leave to their children.\r\n\r\nFlordelina operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 pesos worth of cooking oil or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling at a piece rate. Her store is located adjacent to her house. She also manages a direct-selling business in which she sells branded apparel, shoes, cosmetics and other beauty products. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 350 to 500 Philippine pesos (Php) in sales every day for her variety store and direct-selling business.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php26,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n \r\nFlordelina dreams to be able to give all her children a good and high-quality education through all her hard work in her business. She faithfully meets up with her fellowship* co-members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and pay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":607785,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

They have five children who are 3 to 15 years old. Gina joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Gina has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 3,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her fifth loan, she is borrowing PHP 11,000, which she intends to use to purchase more stock to sell so she can continue to save for her business and her children's education. Gina A. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

In the evening, she sells balut (fertilized duck egg), which is a local delicacy. In the Philippines, workers and most families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings where all family members are at home. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one or two persons when buying cooked rice and food costs less. \r\n\r\nRosalinda's regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php200 in sales every day. To help continue operating her business, she is requesting a Php 8,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more meat, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings. She will also invest a portion of the loan to buy more quantities of balut, which must be replenished each day.

She earns a minimum of Php 200 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, Arlyn is requesting a Php 10,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy quantities of products like groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n\r\nArlyn dreams of being able to renovate her house soon, with all of her work in her business.

Roath T. lives in Roluos village in Takeo province. She was born in 1959. She and her husband, Mr. Man Chhouk, are farmers who own a 4 hectare plot of land to cultivate rice to sell to support their family. She is also a Khmer cake maker. She is the mother of three children:  one is a laborer in Thailand, one owns a threshing machine and the other one is a student.

She has been a widow for almost seven years. Since her husband\u2019s death, she shoulders all the responsibility for taking care of her children and sending them to school. In 2004 she became a member of Ahon sa Hirap, Inc. (ASHI) \u2013 a partner microfinance institution of Kiva in the Philippines. From then on ASHI became her partner in providing for her family's daily needs and improving their lives. Today all of her children have college degrees and their own jobs. The family's primary source of income is selling fish, a business that Victoria started from her loan with ASHI.  \r\n\r\nShe is applying for another loan of PHP 20,000 for additional capital to buy fish from small fishermen in the community. She sells these fish in nearby municipal markets and cities. She wants to improve her business to make it more stable. By doing this, she knows that she can create jobs and help the fishermen she buys from to improve their own standards of living. She is thankful that ASHI and Kiva give her the opportunity to have access to capital and to improve her family's quality of life. She hopes that the two institutions will support her in her dream of providing employment within her community, especially to out-of-school youth.\r\n\r\nPlease ignore the date on the picture.

D. is from the village of Bolinao.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Elma has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Elma joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI which was used to purchase additional products to sell. Elma is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand the products offered. This will be the fifth loan that Elma has taken out from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the central and north-eastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

(ASHI), a Kiva microfinance institution partner in the Philippines since 1999. She is 46 years old and is the mother of five children. She got married at the early age of 18 and only finished her junior year in high school. With this experience she was encouraged to engage in business so that she can provide her family with a better living and send her children to school.\r\n\r\nRodori joined ASHI to have access to capital that she and her husband utilized in fish trading, their primary source of income. As part of the success of their fish-trading business she was able to put up a store that she manages. The profit in this secondary business helps with their daily financial needs and school allowances for her children.\r\n\r\nAgain, Rodori is applying for a loan of Php 20,000 to buy an additional stock of fish for trading and fingerlings (small fish) for their fishpond. She is optimistic that their income will increase so that she can earn and save more for the expense of her children\u2019s schooling. She is dreaming that all her children will finish a degree in college and find a stable job in the future.\r\n\r\nRodori is thankful for what ASHI and Kiva provide to her family. All the blessings that they benefit from are fruits of the assistance and support that the two institutions offer. She is praying that these institutions will reach more poor but deserving families in the future and change their lives.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":356.25,"image":{"id":607915,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish

To make a living, Ligaya operates a family member's business venture in the food sector preparing and selling pork and chicken barbecue. Ligaya has been engaged in her business for over a year and earns approximately 3,000 PHP per month from these activities.\nIn 2010, Ligaya joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She is requesting a new loan of 4,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. This loan will be her 1st from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to save as a reserve for future emergencies. \n\nAbout ASKI\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She lives in Mauswagon, Brgy. Sibucao, San Enrique, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2005 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her general store business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable.  She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 5,000. Rosie is requesting a loan of PHP 11,000 so that she can buy additional items for her general (sari-sari) store.  This will be her 13th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 14,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom.  Rosie aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way.  About NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Tom is 28 years old and married with one child who is six months old.\r\n\r\nHe has requested this loan through Juhudi of 35,000 KES to purchase and insure a dairy cow. The extra income from this loan will help him improve the livelihood of his family. In the future, he aspires to acquire a piece of land and expand his dairy farming and also expand his kiosk business. His biggest challenges are lack of enough financing to buy farm inputs (e.g., fertilizers) and changes in weather that affect his production.\r\n\r\nHe is grateful to Juhudi for implementing these

Pajac, Lapu-Lapu City, Cebu. She earns her living by operating three business ventures:   a sari-sari (general) store, multicab (a small passenger van) transport and t-shirt printing. Her husband Jaime A., who is 53 years old, works as a multicab driver to earn his living. Their children are between 11 and 19 years old. \r\n\r\nArlene joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2003 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 10 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Arlene has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loans have helped her build her working capital so that she could stock up her general store with a wide variety of merchandise, which now enables her to earn an average monthly income of 70,000 Philippine pesos (PHP), uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 11th loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000, which she intends to use to buy rice and chicken feeds to sell in her general store so that she can continue to sustainably expand her general store and achieve her dream of opening another sari-sari store in a new location, while continuing to improve the living conditions of her family and to save up for the education of her children. Arlene A. is a Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\") woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b> \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon.

She lives in Brgy. Tuyom, Cauayan, Negros Occidental. \r\n\r\nShe has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2007 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her three businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of 8,400 Philippine pesos (PHP). \r\n\r\nDaisy is now borrowing 10,000 PHP so that she can purchase more stock to sell. This will be her fifth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 8,000 PHP, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Daisy aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\") way.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying photo of Daisy was taken after she attended the weekly NWTF-Project Dungganon Center Meeting that all group-based clients must attend. The meetings give each borrower the chance to share ideas with their group, learn new business skills and pay back their weekly installments.\r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b> \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon. Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She lives in Proper Mahawak, Brgy. Mahawak, Medellin, Cebu. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2006 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her general store business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 10,000. Danninova is now borrowing PHP 10,000 to purchase more stock to sell. This will be her 12th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Danninova aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

D. is a married woman who lives in Bara Bat-os, Brgy. Mambulac, Silay City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating three business ventures: a general store and frozen foods and rice retailing businesses. Her husband, Romeo D., aged 30, works as a truck driver to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have two children who are four and six years old. \r\n\r\nAnalyn joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2006 because she aspired to something better for her family. With the help of her past five loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, she has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 5,500, uplifting her family's standard of living. This time, for her sixth cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 18,000, which she intends to use to purchase more merchandise to resell in her general store so that she can continue to save up for future house repairs and her children's education. Analyn D. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means 'Honorable'). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work. \r\n\r\nHelp NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by clicking the link to the NWTF Kiva lending team on Kiva.org to join our

Tagasa, Brgy. Bitoon, Daanbantayan, Cebu. She earns her living by operating a fishing  business.  Her husband, Cesario T., aged 40, is a fisherman, and works with Nenita to earn a living for their family. They have five children who are aged between five and 20 years. The two older ones have started working and the two youngest ones are currently going to school. \r\n\r\nNenita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired to something better for her family. With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, she has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 2,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her fifth cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 11,000 which she intends to use to pay for repair work on her fishing boat and minor house repairs. \r\n\r\nShe hopes to earn enough so that she can continue to save up for her children's future education and have enough to invest in other business activities such as poultry and livestock-raising.  Nenita T. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means 'Honorable'). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work. \r\n\r\nHelp NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by clicking the link to the NWTF Kiva lending team on Kiva.org to join our

D. is a 40-year-old married woman who supports her family by operating a car wash and a car repair shop. She lives in Bali-bali, Cogon, Compostela, Cebu. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2005 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 14,400. \r\n\r\nArlina is now borrowing PHP 26,000 so that she can have additional working capital to expand the operations of her automotive repair shop and car wash businesses. This will be her 12th cycle loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 22,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Arlina aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means 'Honorable'). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\r\nHelp NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by clicking the link to the NWTF Kiva lending team on Kiva.org to join our

O. is a married woman who lives in Basak Mercado, Brgy Basak, Lapu-Lapu City, Cebu. She earns her living by operating two business ventures: a sari-sari (general) store and a vegetable vending business. Her husband, Fernando O., aged 42, works as a Brgy. Tanod (a community security guard) to earn his living. They have seven children who are aged between six and 24. The two oldest ones already have their own families, another works to help the family and two of the younger children currently go to school. \r\n\r\nAmalia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2006 because she aspired to something better for her family. With the help of her past eight loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, she has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 14,000 helped her increase her monthly income to PHP 42,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her ninth cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 14,000, which she intends to use to purchase more products to sell so that she can continue to save up for her children's education, family security and expansion of her businesses. Amalia O. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means 'Honorable'). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

M. G. is 42 years old, married to a tailor and they have two children aged 22 and 13 whom they hope to give a good education to university level. His business is located with many businesses in a residential area called Eastleigh in Nairobi. He has been selling TVs, DVDs, music systems and other electronic products to repeat customers and walk-in customers. Besides this business, he also owns a clothing business in an open air market known as Muthurwa in Nairobi. He has been doing this business for the past two years and he says that it is profitable. \r\n\r\nThe major challenge that James has is that there are too many people in the area with the same kind of business as his so customers are not very loyal as they are spoilt for choice. However, he works very hard from early morning to late evening to keep his business going well. He is using his loan of Kes 50,000 to buy more electronic products and clothes to grow his businesses. He plans to expand his clothing business and he hopes to own several boutiques in different towns in future. He describes himself as very hard-working, generous and dedicated to his

Paho, Brgy. Pacol, Valladolid, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating three business ventures: vegetable farming, rice farming and RTW (ready-to-wear) businesses. Teresita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2003 because she aspired to something better for her family. \r\n\r\nWith the help of her past 12 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Teresita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 17,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 12,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 13th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 25,000, which she intends to use to buy fertilizers, pesticides and insecticides for her farming activities so that she can continue to save up for her children's future education. Teresita C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means 'Honorable'). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

G. is a widow who lives in Brgy. Tabagak, Madredijos, Cebu City. She earns her living by operating three business ventures: hog raising, water supply and fishing businesses. She has four children who are aged between 33 and 39. Beviana joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1999 because she aspired to something better for her family. \r\n\r\nWith the help of her past 19 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Beviana has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 29,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 3,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 20th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 29,500 which she intends to use to purchase more pigs to raise and rice for her business so that she can continue to save up for her future plans of buying a small piece of land where she intends to put up a sari-sari (general) store. Beviana G. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means 'Honorable'). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

R. is a married woman who lives in Sitio Canbuhin, Brgy. Mambugsay, Cauayan, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures: vegetable vending and pig fattening businesses. Her husband, Fernando, aged 44, works as a farmer to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have five children aged from six to 17. Jocelyn joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2003 because she aspired to something better for her family. \r\n\r\nWith the help of her past eight loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Jocelyn has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 14,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4,100, uplifting her family's standard of living. This time, for her ninth cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 16,000, which she intends to use to purchase fertilizers for her vegetable farm and food for her pigs so she can continue to save up for her children's future education. Jocelyn R. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means 'Honorable'). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She makes items of clothing according to the styles the customers request.\r\n\r\nThis activity is very important for her because she earns good family income.

To help sustain her household, Maria sells the yogurt she makes every day and distributes it throughout the Recreo district, through shops that know her products well. She leaves very early in the mornings to buy the milk at the dairies near her home, and makes it into 10 or 20 litres of yogurt each day for later distribution. Because she works from home, she makes the most of this to look after the needs of her family. Her dream is to be able to buy machines to make her yogurt in large quantities. Already she is also packaging the yogurt in little bags for sale as frozen yogurt \/ icecream. They now need the finance to build a separate room for making the yogurt, as they need more space.

She has three children, a boy and two girls.  Santiago is 21 and works in Cuautla in a shoe store.  Arisbeth, 16, is in school and works in a natural products store.  Lorenza, 12, is in school.\r\n\r\nMargarita has a grocery store and also sells Jafra brand catalogue products.  She asked for the loan to buy soap, soft drinks, candies, soups, cooking oil, sugar and eggs to stock her store.  The store is called \u201cAbarrotes Pe\u00f1a\u201d and it was passed down to her by her in-laws.  She started the business two years ago when she still had her mother-in-law.  She has since passed away and left the store to her and she tends to it now.  She offers her customers, who are her neighbors, beverages, candies, Sabritas (brand of snacks), Gamesa (cracker and cookie brand), Marinela (packaged pastry brand) and Jafra catalogue products. The store is in her home.  Her son Santiago helps out on Sundays.\r\n\r\nShe considers her store to be important because it provides benefits for her family; it has helped her provide her children\u2019s education.  She enjoys taking care of her customers and feels proud to produce family income for any emergency and not having to seek out someone to get a loan from. She uses profits for household expenses and to buy more merchandise.\r\n\r\nShe faces competition from two other stores near hers.  Her plans and hopes are to continue in business and to sell more.  Her hopes for her children are that they continue to study and be in good health.  She hopes to reach these goals by working hard at sales so that the business grows.\r\n\r\nMargarita likes the town of Huitzililla because that\u2019s where she was born and where she lives.  They plant onions in irrigated fields and corn and sorghum seasonally.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1450,"image":{"id":605601,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":" To buy soap, soft drinks, soups, cooking oil, sugar.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Huitzililla, Morelos","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2010-09-27T18:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cruz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maribel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luisa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felipa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":18000,"loan_amount":1450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2010-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2010-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2010-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2010-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2010-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2011-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181.25},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":181.25},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":181.25},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":181.25},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":181.25},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":181.25},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":181.25},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":181.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":181.25,"local_amount":2250,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-20T08:27:03Z","rounded_local_amount":2272.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172121215,"comment":null},{"amount":181.25,"local_amount":2250,"processed_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:25:51Z","rounded_local_amount":2272.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177415391,"comment":null},{"amount":181.25,"local_amount":2250,"processed_date":"2010-10-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:26:18Z","rounded_local_amount":2272.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177415392,"comment":null},{"amount":362.5,"local_amount":4500,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:16:18Z","rounded_local_amount":4544.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182554975,"comment":null},{"amount":362.5,"local_amount":4500,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:17:43Z","rounded_local_amount":4544.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188691465,"comment":null},{"amount":181.25,"local_amount":2250,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:44:55Z","rounded_local_amount":2272.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191430649,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-09-28T01:21:21Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T03:44:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":234886,"name":"Jiguiya Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Les quatre  femmes du groupe JIGUIYA sont toutes mari\u00e9es  avec une moyenne d\u2019\u00e2ge de 42  ans et 5 enfants.

She thanks you for your support.   \r\n\r\nIn Nepal, large supermarkets are rare. Instead, most items can be found in the small, densely packed pasals that line the streets of every city and village. Piled high with utensils, paper goods and anything else one would need, these stores are your one-stop shop in Nepal. Although usually packed into a space no larger than 100 square feet, these stores carry a sizable and diverse inventory. With the help of Kiva loans, pasal owners are able to keep inventory up and customers happy. Competition is fierce, but with extra capital and a bit of creativity, the opportunity for profit is there.\r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007. Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women. In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community. \r\nFor more information about Patan BPW, visit our partner page

In the future, she wants to finish constructing her house. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Harold Sims, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":608297,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"BUYING MILK PRODUCTS, RICE AND DRINKS TO SELL ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Duran (Primavera)","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":147,"posted_date":"2010-09-27T20:10:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ramona Cecilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":89.14},{"due_date":"2010-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":89.41},{"due_date":"2010-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":92.25},{"due_date":"2011-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":93.62},{"due_date":"2011-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":95.79},{"due_date":"2011-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":99.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":100.32},{"due_date":"2011-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":103.05},{"due_date":"2011-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":105.04},{"due_date":"2011-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":107.72},{"due_date":"2011-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":109.97},{"due_date":"2011-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":114.02}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.14},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.41},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.25},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.62},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.79},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.32},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.05},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.04},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.72},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.97},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.02}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":89.14,"local_amount":89.14,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:55:14Z","rounded_local_amount":89.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177405954,"comment":null},{"amount":89.41,"local_amount":89.41,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:06:00Z","rounded_local_amount":89.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182544417,"comment":null},{"amount":92.25,"local_amount":92.25,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:09:26Z","rounded_local_amount":92.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188681175,"comment":null},{"amount":93.62,"local_amount":93.62,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T01:46:34Z","rounded_local_amount":93.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191379497,"comment":null},{"amount":95.79,"local_amount":95.79,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-23T08:19:45Z","rounded_local_amount":95.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195797486,"comment":null},{"amount":99.67,"local_amount":99.67,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-17T08:04:25Z","rounded_local_amount":99.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201239646,"comment":null},{"amount":100.32,"local_amount":100.32,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:21:40Z","rounded_local_amount":100.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206106092,"comment":null},{"amount":103.05,"local_amount":103.05,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-20T07:52:37Z","rounded_local_amount":103.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211862848,"comment":null},{"amount":105.04,"local_amount":105.04,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:40:57Z","rounded_local_amount":105.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216459332,"comment":null},{"amount":331.71,"local_amount":331.71,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-29T07:44:23Z","rounded_local_amount":331.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221623184,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-09-30T10:36:14Z","paid_date":"2011-08-29T07:44:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":234897,"name":"Sabina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is 25-year-old Sabina R..

She has already received and successfully repaid 2 loans from Patan BPW. She used her most recent loan to increase store inventory. In the future, Sabina plans to expand her business. She thanks you for your support.  \r\n\r\nIn the Kathmandu Valley, the small grocery stores, called pasals, are an important part of the local economy. Fresh produce, milk and staples such as rice, lentils and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home. Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margins. By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability. While a typical pasal might be no more than 100 sq. feet, they are always full of bargaining customers, in-coming produce and shrewd businesswomen. \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007. Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women. In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community. \r\n\r\nFor more information about Patan BPW, visit our partner

With her line of handcrafted leather collars and leashes, Ana is looking to change that, one pet at a time.\r\n\r\nPaco Collars is located in Berkeley, California, and is part artists\u2019 workshop, part retail store, and part classroom. Ana and her employees craft high-quality collars and leashes right in the shop, as well as hosting classes in leatherwork.\r\n\r\nAna started her business in 2002 after she began getting requests from friends for collars similar to the one she had made for her own dog, Paco. \u201cA business adviser suggested that I make the designs and send them to be manufactured in China,\u201d she says, \u201cbut that was the opposite of what I wanted to do. I was excited to create jobs for artists, and to keep the manufacturing process local.\u201d\r\n\r\nAna now employs five part-time workers, and calls in extra help for big orders. However, as demand for her products has increased, She has had trouble finding financing to buy new machines because she doesn\u2019t have an established credit history. A $1,000 loan from Opportunity Fund will allow her to purchase new supplies to boost her inventory and, at the same time, build a credit history for future loans. \u201cYou can\u2019t make money unless you can process money,\u201d she says, \u201cbut you can\u2019t process money unless you have a line of credit. A company needs it\u2019s own line of credit \u2013 this loan is pivotal.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn the future, Ana would like to see a branch of Paco Collars open in New York City. \u201cOur goal is to create a brand within the pet industry. We want to build the most responsible, ethical company we can, sticking to the things we believe in, but bigger.\u201d\r\n\r\nFind out more about Ana and Paco Collars at <a

As mentioned, her main obstacle has been a lack of access to working capital.\r\n\r\nIsabel wakes up early every day in order to complete domestic tasks and prepare her children for school. The rest of her day is dedicated to her business, making sales, or collecting payments from clients in her community.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the group, Isabel mentions that all the women are from the same community. She says that the group lending model is advantageous because it allows the women to act as guarantors for each other\u2019s loans.  Additionally, Isabel is thankful for the support offered by Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer to the group as a whole. She is aware of the potential disadvantage which may present itself if any members are unable to pay back their loans, as the whole group is responsible for all repayments.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2975,"image":{"id":608428,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To purchase inventory such as pajamas and other catalog merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Siquirritos, Lim\u00f3n","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":151,"posted_date":"2010-09-28T15:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2975,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Manuela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lyanneth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ania","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Marta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isabel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatriz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":1500000,"loan_amount":2975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":239787.17},{"due_date":"2010-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":243783.62},{"due_date":"2010-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":247846.68},{"due_date":"2011-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":251977.46},{"due_date":"2011-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":256177.09},{"due_date":"2011-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":260427.98}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":475.58},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":483.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":491.56},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":499.76},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":508.08},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":516.52}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":475.6,"local_amount":239800,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:02:00Z","rounded_local_amount":240037.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177411574,"comment":null},{"amount":483.53,"local_amount":243796.67,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:09:39Z","rounded_local_amount":244037.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182551362,"comment":null},{"amount":491.59,"local_amount":247859.94,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-19T09:52:30Z","rounded_local_amount":248104.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189148784,"comment":null},{"amount":499.78,"local_amount":251990.94,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:42:45Z","rounded_local_amount":252240,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191428397,"comment":null},{"amount":508.09,"local_amount":256178,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-27T09:21:48Z","rounded_local_amount":256431.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196970534,"comment":null},{"amount":516.41,"local_amount":260374.45,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-04T08:06:05Z","rounded_local_amount":260631.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201289977,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-09-29T00:26:33Z","paid_date":"2011-05-04T08:06:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":234941,"name":"Lydia Junieth","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Se\u00f1ora Lydia Junieth se dedica a la venta de mercader\u00eda en general, tiene 3 hijos que asisten a escuela primaria y para poder sustentar su hogar es que ella tiene este negocio.

The name was chosen for the enterprising women members and for the location of the group. The municipality is known for the businesses that are run mostly by young women, each with a tremendous will to improve the quality of life for their children and their family. The members' plan is to have the women on that municipality to have steady work, and to bring renewed development to the region. The members of the group all are originally from the State of Hidalgo. There are 11 members in the group. \r\n\r\nThe photo was taken in the house Maria Natividad G. V.. She is the treasurer of the group. A great harmony and collegiality exists among them. Natividad is 40 years old and she graduated high school. She is married and she has 3 children, 2 boys and a girl. She sells shoes through a catalogue and she has had the business for the past year. She requests a loan to invest in the purchase of shoes and new catalogues. Her wish is to not only sell shoes but also clothing to make more sales in less time. Her clients comment that Natividad is a very kind person and she provides great customer service. She sells her products at an accessible price and offers flexibility in payment methods, in cash or in credit with weekly payments, depending on the clients' situation. \r\n\r\nWhen she applied for the loan she was very happy to have the opportunity to improve her sales and to strive towards her dream of supporting her son as he readies for a career in Baseball.

She has been selling clothing for youth and adults, stuffed animals and cosmetics for the past nine years. Sandra started her retail businesses by selling underwear and, with time, changed her merchandise. She sells her products from home and also door-to-door. She also holds a second job working at a resort, \u201cTermas de Chill\u00e1n\u201d. Her tasks include cleaning and assisting in decoration for events. \r\n\r\nSandra plans to use this loan to purchase clothing. She travels to Santiago, the capital of Chile, where she is able to find her merchandise at wholesale prices thus reducing her costs. Her goal is to have an established business, located in front of her house, where she would sell the same products but could easily add new ones.\r\n \r\nSandra received economic assistance from the Chilean Government through a family subsidy. She was also able to twice win FOSIS (Fondo de Solidaridad e Inversi\u00f3n Social government agency, aimed at supporting the country's poorest families). Sandra obtained these FOSIS funds for her business a while ago. She used them to purchase a car to transport her merchandise and two mirrors as customers like to view and try on the clothing.\r\n \r\nSandra\u00b4s motivation stems from taking care of her children and providing them the opportunity to pursue their studies. Three of her children, aged 12, 13 and 18, still depend on her. In total Sandra has four children. The oldest is 20 and no longer lives with her. \r\n\r\nSandra enjoys working with Kiva partner, Fondo Esperanza, as they did not ask her to provide her credit history and they only charge a small interest rate.

She has 4 children between the ages of 12 and 27-years-old. Since a very young age she's known the fishing business well because she comes from a family of fishermen. From that background came the idea to have a small commercial fishing company, and this initiative helped develop her skills as a businesswoman. From this knowledge comes also the transportation service that she provides in her town, where it's typical to get from one place to another on motorcycles. \r\n\r\nFor more than 23 years she has sold fish. Her husband is a well-known fisherman in Palermo, a port in Barranquilla, and people come to their home to buy the fish because they know that Luz Marina offers the freshest and healthiest fish every day. Thanks to her work she managed to buy a house and and save enough income to start her motorcycle transport service. She and her siblings have been connected for serveral years with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and they know the organization very well. Currently she's applying to obtain this Kiva loan with which she will buy a canoe, which will help her ensure the stability of her product. The canoe they currently work with is small and in poor condition. With the loans from this organization she's managed to buy a smoke chiller, increase her income and, above all, build her credit. Her biggest challenge is when the fish supply is low and it becomes difficult to meet the demand of her customers. The solution to this is the purchase of a bigger canoe in perfect condition. Her dreams are focused on the expansion of her business because she knows well that increasing her services will help her buy a new motorcycle for her transport business, which is another generator of income that will help improve her family's quality of life. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kate Richardson, Kiva

She lives in the Barlovento de Barranquilla district together with her common-law husband and their three children, aged between 17 and 30 years of age. About 20 years ago she started as a small business owner to have a source of income for her family, previously a responsibility taken on by her husband alone. In 2004 an uncle of hers living in the US gave her the idea to start selling soft drinks. To get her started he gave her a refrigerator with the capacity to hold 700 bottles, one that she still uses. She started out her business in this fashion and the refrigerator continues to be her work tool. \r\n\r\nAna sells a variety of other items as well, including specialized catalogues and ladies' and gentlemen's clothing. Her goal is to add a greater variety to her business and to excel in customer service. Her house is conveniently located and she has space enough to have a store. The neighbors in her district and the surrounding areas will be able to get the items they need, especially office supplies, household products, and beauty products. Her greatest challenge is not having enough working capital. For this reason she has accessed a loan through Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo. With the loan she has been able to gradually achieve her goal but she hopes to continue the development of her business, opening new opportunities to invest her loan. The loans have increased her clients dramatically, translating into increased sales. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Erika Lindig, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":607024,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase soft drinks, clothing and shoes to get ready for holiday shopping.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2010-09-28T15:20:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1300000,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":95869},{"due_date":"2010-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":100356},{"due_date":"2011-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":102029},{"due_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":103729},{"due_date":"2011-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":105458},{"due_date":"2011-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":107216},{"due_date":"2011-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":109003},{"due_date":"2011-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":110819},{"due_date":"2011-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":112666},{"due_date":"2011-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":114544},{"due_date":"2011-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":116453},{"due_date":"2011-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":121858}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.47},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.96},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.9},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.85},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.82},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.79},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.79},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.8},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.84},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.88},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.94},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.96}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":53.47,"local_amount":95869,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:08:30Z","rounded_local_amount":96745.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182550744,"comment":null},{"amount":55.96,"local_amount":100356,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:14:25Z","rounded_local_amount":101273.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188688352,"comment":null},{"amount":56.9,"local_amount":102029,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:39:14Z","rounded_local_amount":102961.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191427573,"comment":null},{"amount":57.85,"local_amount":103729,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-16T08:40:27Z","rounded_local_amount":104677.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196000993,"comment":null},{"amount":58.82,"local_amount":105458,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:08:13Z","rounded_local_amount":106422.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201288999,"comment":null},{"amount":59.79,"local_amount":107216,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:04:55Z","rounded_local_amount":108196.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206157153,"comment":null},{"amount":60.79,"local_amount":109003,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:18:16Z","rounded_local_amount":109999.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211230160,"comment":null},{"amount":61.8,"local_amount":110819,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:09:00Z","rounded_local_amount":111832.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216509035,"comment":null},{"amount":62.84,"local_amount":112666,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:49:03Z","rounded_local_amount":113696.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221673265,"comment":null},{"amount":196.78,"local_amount":352855,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:01:07Z","rounded_local_amount":356081.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227319827,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-09-30T00:20:32Z","paid_date":"2011-09-17T08:01:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":234961,"name":"Amira Maria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Amira Mar\u00eda A. de 33 a\u00f1os es una mujer emprendedora, que vive en el barrio la Paz de la ciudad de Barranquilla con su esposo y su peque\u00f1o hijo de 3 a\u00f1os de edad.

She lives in the district of La Paz in the city of Barranquilla. She lives together with her husband and their 3-year old little boy. She once worked as a health administrator but she found herself unemployed. She then decided to pursue her dream and to become independent. She managed to have a source of income for herself. She is well known by many people, a benefit from her previous job. She decided to purchase a variety of merchandise and as a trial run she purchased the items the clientele requested. These were her first clients and the first merchandise sold was Murano crystals and silver. Gradually Amira started to expand her client base. Her husband is a teacher and he refers his colleague and acquaintances to the business. They complete their sales on credit. This is the third loan she accesses through Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo. With her previous loans she has managed to add variety to her products and she now sells anything from TV remote controls to gold and silver jewelry and clothing for ladies, men and children, etc. \r\n\r\nShe will use her loan to purchase clothing for ladies, men, and kids to have a well stocked store in preparation for the holiday season at year's end. Her dream is to have a jewelry store to set her business apart from the others. But she needs substantial working capital. In the mean time she is driven to sell all kinds of products to her clientele. She is supported by the love of her husband and their son.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Erika Lindig, Kiva

She works sells toys and she  also sells other various types of merchandise in the city of Monteria. She travels there with frequency. She is a widow and she has 5 children between the ages of 36 and 42. \r\n\r\nShe requests a loan to invest in the purchase of materials to make her dolls, such as fabrics, faces and threads, as well as to purchase merchandise such as clothing to ready her clients for the end of year holidays. She will make her sales in the city of Monteria but there she will also purchase milk products such as cream, butter, whey, cheese, and white corn cakes to resell in the city of Cartagena.  She started out selling her merchandise through a catalogue but gradually she started selling clothing imported from the city of Medellin where the quality of clothing is excellent. She started adding more items to sell based on customers' requests, including gold jewelry. But it was though her shoe sales that she became known in all the villages in the Cordoba region and throughout all of Columbia. She purchased merchandise in each place she visited. This is her second loan through Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo. With the previous loan she supplemented her working capital and she is appreciative of the support, indicating that it was better than going to a bank. Her dream is to improve the quality of her dolls and to one day have a restaurant because she loves to cook. \r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Erika Lindig, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1053.33,"image":{"id":608504,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":"To purchase materials to make dools and to purchase clothing.

This community distinguishes itself because the predominant economic activities are farming and raising livestock, as well as making plastic rope.  The group is comprised of 10 members.\r\n\r\nBIBIANA VICTORIA V. D. is one member of the group.  She is originally from the San Pedro el Alto area, and has lived in this community for 44 years.  She dedicates herself to making plastic cords (they are used for sports at the schools); she also works in the farmlands, and for her neighbors when they need domestic services.  Her customers are the bookstores of the neighboring communities, since she makes and sells her product by the dozens.  She comments that one of the reasons for her business\u2019 success is the fact that she always has tried to have her orders ready on time.\r\n\r\nShe is 44 years old, and finished primary school.  She is married and has 6 children, of whom only 3 still depend on her.  One of them is in preparatory school, one in secondary and the other in primary.  \r\n\r\nShe wants this loan to continue investing in her business, and to buy raw materials for several orders that she has pending.  She hopes that the loan will continue to strengthen her business.\r\n\r\nBibiana, as she is known in her town, hopes that her work will allow her children to continue their studies so they can become career professionals.  The loans, until now, have helped her keep her business supplied with merchandise.  In turn, her profits have allowed her to increase her income and proviD. a better quality of life for her family.\r\n\r\nShe plans to continue making rope but in a grander scale, which is why she requests this loan to increase her production.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are: NERI F.

Little by little in 2008 Donellis worked during carnival season, making hand-painted canvas satchels, accessories for little girls and decorations, and this experience went very well. Then in 2009, a friend recommended that she take part in a flea market at a big commercial center, where she showed off her products and perfected her craft by observing and comparing the competition. Her first loan was for $350 COP, which she used to purchase material, and now she has four people who work for her who are all women who are the head of their households. She pays them for their production during carnival season and at the end of the year, when her sales increase and she needs to hire more staff. Her small workshop is located in her home, where she has a stock of materials and her customers come to choose what they want made. She makes things like headbands and other headwear, purses, cell-phone covers, and lately she has been making surprise birthday presents. Donellis dreams of providing a better financial future for her family, which consists of her parents. She also wants to expand her business with local and national sales points, but that requires expanding her coverage area and she doesn't have the necessary capital to do so. For this reason she is requesting the loan from Kiva, which she plans to use to purchase fabric, buttons, silicone, packaging, advertising and displays, since the end of the year is approaching and she needs to prepare herself to meet her customers' demands."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":608398,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":"Purchase fabrics, buttons, packaging, advertising, etc. to prepare for the end of the year.\r\n\r\ncompra de telas, botones, silicona, empaques, publicidad y tambi\u00e9n  exhibidores, pues se acerca la temporada de fin de a\u00f1o y necesita prepararse para responder a sus clientes.

She sells merchandise such as shoes, clothing, lotions, cosmetics, and other personal products.  Martha started this business because her husband\u2019s income is low, so she designated a section of her house for establishing a small store where she can earn extra income to support her family.  One of the disadvantages that she faces is that her business is located along a dirt road.  When the weather gets hot she must keep the door open, which causes her merchandise to be covered in dust.  \r\n<p>\r\nMartha is requesting a loan to buy more merchandise of various kinds.

Martha has been a client of FAMA OPDF for three loan cycles and possesses a very good payment history.

At first she opened a store, utilizing the experience she gained while working at a retail business.  However, all of her customers requested credit, so she was not able to collect payments in a timely fashion as required by her business.  She then decided to sell merchandise to customers who were employed and did very well.  From there she also chose to pursue the activity she enjoys the most and comes to her naturally \u2013 making woven purses and hammocks.  At the same time, Ruby started another business preparing lunches to go because she is a food expert.  She continued to sell clothing and shoes as a necessity because she had established customers and later on added household goods to the inventory of products she offered.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis Kiva loan is the third time she has requested financing from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  With her previous loans, Ruby was able to increase her earnings and pay for her children\u2019s schooling because her greatest dream is to see them work tirelessly until they can finish university.  Her children are very studious and also dream of becoming professionals.  In addition, her loans helped her to acquire tools and equipment to retrofit her food business so that she could expand and diversify her product offering which she has already achieved.  With this loan she plans to buy thread and natural fibers for making purses for which she has received orders.  In addition, she will buy ingredients such as rice, oil, salt, and meat in large volume, as well as a variety of other merchandise.  \r\n<p>\r\nRuby\u2019s biggest challenge is selecting customers who are responsible when purchasing on credit.

In 2007 she returned to Colombia with no money after living in Venezuela.  The only asset that she had was the house she acquired as a result of working for such a long time.  At that point, Betty decided to start from scratch.  Her husband worked as a mason, but he had lost touch with all of his contacts in the construction business.  For this reason, she started a business selling frozen treats, soft drinks, frozen fruits, and cheese snacks at the entrance of a school near her home.  This allowed her to earn some money to support her family.  As her husband started to find work, she began accepting orders and traveling to buy the items that her customers needed.  In return, her customers would pay for all of their merchandise by a specified deadline.  Gradually and judiciously, Betty was able to buy a display case for organizing her business and exhibiting her merchandise.  With great effort and discipline in her work, she was able to move her children forward with their education.  Betty hopes to fulfill her dream of seeing her children become professionals.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is her first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  Betty will use the proceeds to buy clothing, shoes, and cosmetics since she sells more these products at the end of year and has already received orders for these items.  Her dream is to convert her business to a large variety store where she can offer a little bit of everything that her customers need until her establishment becomes well-known.  Her greatest challenge is to build up her operating capital every day, so the loans will help her in this regard."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":969.69,"image":{"id":608517,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchase

B. is from the village of Brgy.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from preparing and selling cooked food for daily meals. Lucrecia has been engaged in her business for more than 15 years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Lucrecia joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Lucrecia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 13,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. Lucrecia is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Lucrecia from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.
