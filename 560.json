Fabiola's wish is that her children study while living eating a healthy diet and in a safe home.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":729211,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","use":" to purchase stock to enter the dairy cooperative","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Cochabamba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.383333 -66.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":140,"posted_date":"2011-03-15T21:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fabiola","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-02-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":41.59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.59}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":41.67,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:42:05Z","rounded_local_amount":41.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201262282,"comment":null},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":41.67,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:53:56Z","rounded_local_amount":41.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211201181,"comment":null},{"amount":41.66,"local_amount":41.66,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:46:05Z","rounded_local_amount":41.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216479419,"comment":null},{"amount":875,"local_amount":875,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T07:53:27Z","rounded_local_amount":875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221642343,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-03-16T03:47:24Z","paid_date":"2011-09-17T07:53:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":280634,"name":"Victoria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Victoria is 59 years old, married, and has ten children.

He has been a widower for 15 years.  He has two children who live with him in his own house located in the Arroyo Negro community in the district of San Francisco.  For Emiliano, age is not an impediment to continuing to move ahead and benefit.  Since he was very small, his parents taught him to work on the farm, and he knows the hard work of the countryside.  Emiliano is a farmer; he has five hectares of barbasco plants, coffee plants, and coca leaves.  He has been working for 27 years on his own land, and during harvest time he depends on the help of his two children and day laborers with whom he contracts in order to bring in the harvest more quickly. What he likes most about his work is harvesting, since then he feels compensated for his months of hard work.  He thinks the most difficult thing is transporting his products from the farm to the city of San Francisco, where he is offered better prices for his products.  He mentions that he doesn't like winter, because during those months the insects are plentiful and the rains impede his work and damage his crops.  The loan asked for is so he can buy more coffee seeds, plant them, and benefit from his crops in less time.  But now his first priority is to buy new land to expand his cultivation and increase his production.  This is his first credit with MFP.  He feels it will help him a lot to progress with his work.  He thanks the institution for granting him the loan.  With the 1500 nuevos soles asked for, he will buy coffee seeds, plant them, and benefit from his crops in less

She lives with Nerio, 33, and their 5 children in a house that they own in Nueva Esperanza, a town in Quimbiri.  Hilda and Nerio support the family.  Hilda has been a farmer--work that she learned from her parents--since she was a girl.  She owns 4 hectares of land where she grows coffee, achiote and coca, all plants native to the Rio Apurimac valley in the Peruvian Amazon.  She started working the land for herself 17 years ago.  At harvest time, she can count on the help of both her children and temporary day laborers who she needs to get her crop in quickly.  Hilda likes harvesting her crops because the harvest is her reward for many months of working hard to grow the very best crop she can.  The most difficult thing about the business, she says, is getting the crop from her fields to the market in the town of San Francisco where she can get the best price for her crop.  Her immediate problem is that she doesn't have the equipment she needs to process her coffee beans.  She is applying to MFP for a loan to buy the equipment she needs.  She has 2 hectares of uncultivated land and, in the future, she wants to plant more coffee there.  This is Hilda's first MFP loan.  She knows that she has to repay this loan on time to secure future loans.  She will use the loan to buy equipment for her coffee planting business."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":497.99,"image":{"id":729224,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy equipment for processing coffee beans","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-03-13T01:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hilda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":101.66},{"due_date":"2011-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":105.34},{"due_date":"2011-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":110.69},{"due_date":"2011-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":114.56},{"due_date":"2011-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":117.31},{"due_date":"2011-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":121.54},{"due_date":"2011-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":126.92},{"due_date":"2011-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":130.53},{"due_date":"2011-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":135.94},{"due_date":"2012-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":139.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":145.59},{"due_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":150.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.28},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.62},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.59},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.02},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.56},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.54},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.86},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.84},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.22},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.38},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":55.47,"local_amount":151.28,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:31:46Z","rounded_local_amount":153.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206196351,"comment":null},{"amount":23.88,"local_amount":65.12,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:41:08Z","rounded_local_amount":66.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211270029,"comment":null},{"amount":39.05,"local_amount":106.51,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:33:10Z","rounded_local_amount":108.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216550045,"comment":null},{"amount":42.97,"local_amount":117.2,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:13:40Z","rounded_local_amount":118.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221718725,"comment":null},{"amount":42.22,"local_amount":115.14,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:12:58Z","rounded_local_amount":116.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350163,"comment":null},{"amount":45.08,"local_amount":122.94,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:48:32Z","rounded_local_amount":124.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232850671,"comment":null},{"amount":46.65,"local_amount":127.23,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:55:43Z","rounded_local_amount":129.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238665893,"comment":null},{"amount":47.99,"local_amount":130.87,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:42:29Z","rounded_local_amount":132.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621059,"comment":null},{"amount":49.47,"local_amount":134.93,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:50:50Z","rounded_local_amount":136.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250835262,"comment":null},{"amount":52.07,"local_amount":142.01,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:17:48Z","rounded_local_amount":144.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245034,"comment":null},{"amount":53.14,"local_amount":144.94,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:32:13Z","rounded_local_amount":147.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263385244,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-03-15T23:15:26Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":280638,"name":"Las Entusiastas De La 3Era Etapa De La Era Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Sra.

is a 61-year-old married woman who supports her family by operating three business ventures: a sari-sari store, food vending and raising livestock. \n\nVioleta lives in Negros Occidental with her family. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 1996 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 40,000. \n\nVioleta is borrowing PHP 22,500 to purchase more stock to sell in her general store. This will be her 19th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 19,500, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom.

Mr. Makara is also a palm juice collector and a firewood salesman. In order to improve their family's income, they want to start a new business but do not have the money to do so. Thus, Mrs. Sarann is requesting a loan to buy a cow for breeding. The couple supports a child who is 1 year old. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":729367,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase a cow for breeding","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":109,"posted_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sarann","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-02-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":1000000,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":100900},{"due_date":"2011-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":100900},{"due_date":"2011-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":100900},{"due_date":"2011-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":100900},{"due_date":"2011-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":100900},{"due_date":"2011-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":100900},{"due_date":"2011-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":100900},{"due_date":"2011-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":100900},{"due_date":"2011-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":100900},{"due_date":"2012-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":91900}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.23},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.22},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.23},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.22},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.23},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.22},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.23},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.22},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.23},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.97}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":110,"local_amount":440000,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:07:44Z","rounded_local_amount":440550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206092996,"comment":null},{"amount":140,"local_amount":560000,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-01T07:56:47Z","rounded_local_amount":560700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221611199,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-04-01T19:37:01Z","paid_date":"2011-09-01T07:56:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":280710,"name":"Edgard","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Edgard G. is from the village of Olango.

Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral.  This is Fiapito's 2nd loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"\"overall social metric score.\"\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"\"level of education\"\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

ocean-caught fish. She has one year of experience in this business. She needs a loan of 1,000 WST to purchase a fishing boat.  She plans to use the profit (estimated to be 300 WST or around $125 per week) to improve her business.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Kalala joined SPBD to gain access to financial services. Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral.  This is Kalala's 1st loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"\"overall social metric score.\"\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"\"level of education\"\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD:\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

operates a business of selling herbs and spices in the local community.  She has one year of experience in this business.  She needs a loan of 1,000 WST to purchase raw ingredients needed to make the products she sells.  She plans to use the profits (estimated to be 250 WST or around $104 per week) to expand her business.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Amelia joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral.  This is Amelia 's 1st loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"\"overall social metric score.\"\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"\"level of education\"\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

He is 44 years old. Freddie is the group leader of a six-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Freddie S.'s Group.\r\n\r\nFreddie is married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, he owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector selling home products. The main source of income for the business comes from selling personal home products to tourists and local community members. Freddie has been engaged in his business for over three years and earns approximately $93 a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Freddie joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. He has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase raw materials needed to make products for sale. \r\n\r\nFreddie is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be his 2nd loan from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated to expand his business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful micro-finance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":727475,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products

She is a leader of this group and is a young mother of three children. Besides that she has been involved in business of breeding and selling cattle for more then a decade.\r\n\r\nAt this time there are one cow and four chickens in her household. Relatively recently Komilahon decided to start breeding poultry. It brings her a small income, but still helps to cover some expenses. Her husband as well as her oldest son works in private construction business. It brings 2000 soms of income a month. Not very much, but Komilahon was able to save a small amount to build a new cow house. When she found out that she needs to bring together a group of like minded people Komilahon has not for a minute doubted who will be the members of her group.\r\n\r\nShe very much wants to buy more of small horned cattle for feeding and growing, as well as other members of the group who plan to spend the loan on developing their businesses.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1375,"image":{"id":729459,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

Flora has successfully repaid a previous loan of 23,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in future. Flora is requesting a new loan of 24000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional groceries to sell. This loan will be the 8th loan taken out by Flora from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the borrower's business. \n\nAbout ASKI:\n\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

Daniel is 5 years old and is not at school yet. Frangky and family live in the village of Pariti, which is about 35 km from the Kupang City. \r\n\r\nIn order to meet his family's needs, Frengky runs a shrimp business. Usually he goes to sea in the afternoon around 2 pm when the weather is good and returns home at 2 am in the following day. Frengky usually uses a trawl for catching the shrimp. In a day, Frengky can drag about 2 to 3 kg of shrimp, and he sells the shrimp at about IDR 35,000 to 55,000 per kg. However, his trawl is currently broken and Frengky does not have enough money to mend it. As a result, he cannot go to catch shrimp.\r\n\r\nFrengky tried to farm in addition to catch shrimp. He planted cabbage in a small quantity due to the limited fund that he had. Of 100 seedlings of cabbage planted, 60 of them grow and can be harvested after 3 weeks. One cabbage is sold at IDR 4,000 at the traditional market in Camplong. Frengky sees that the result of farming cabbage is quite promising for the future and so he intends to seek for a loan to support him improving the businesses.\r\n\r\nFrengky is requesting a loan amounting to IDR 10,000,000 from TLM. He plans to spend the loan on cabbage seeds, to fix the trawl and to buy a chainsaw to be leased. If the capital is still sufficient then he also plans to buy piglets for breeding.

In a day, she can earn roughly IDR 90,000 - 150,000.

She is full of energy and motivation to improve her business, which had been founded 12 years ago. After tying the marriage knot, Sapargul and her husband, like most families in Uzgen, took their first small steps in starting a livestock business. Back then, Sapargul could never have guessed that 5000 soms of starting capital would turn out to be possibly the best investment in all her career. Raising livestock always has been socially important for the local population, along with farming and trade. Already as a young girl, Sapargul would go together with her friends to guard farm animals at grazing fields with plenty of fresh grass and spring water. And now our client still takes the issue of nutrition and other living conditions of her livestock very responsibly. She has her animals regularly examined by  a veterinarian, since the products she sells have a direct impact on consumers\u2019 health. In recent years, however, storm clouds have gathered over this business. An increase in expenditures led to a reduced business revenue, and the attempt to raise prices in a perceptible way has been met with anger by the consumers. It had come to the point that their monthly income fell all the way down to 2,000 soms, which was insufficient even to provide for the day-to-day needs of their two children: their daughter Akhbermet, who is in 7th grade, and their 3-year old son Emir. This was the last drop for Sapargul, and she decided to also go into agriculture as a parallel activity. Uzgen offers auspicious conditions for agriculture. This idea led Sparagul to forming a group in order to take out a loan from Kiva. The concrete purpose of this loan is purchasing fertilizer to prepare soil in the spring."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":729541,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

Uruila is a well-experienced farmer who works the entire spring, summer and fall, knowing from her life experience that earning money is not easy. Although farming offers a steady source of income because food is always in demand, it also carries risks due to weather conditions or factors such as the economic or political situation of the country. <p>\r\n\r\nUruila has been farming for 10 years in a town in Uzgen in southern Kyrgyzstan. Her major crops are sunflower seeds and a special type of Uzgen rice   unique to this  region and requiring special care. Uruila is thankful to live in such a productive area and earns a monthly income of about 16 000 soms. But Uruila is sure that her energy will help her do more if she is able to achieve additional financial support, and so is requesting this loan in order to purchase 100 kg of seeds and 300 kg of fertilizers. She hopes to achieve a rich harvest in the fall because she will use the best fertilizers.<p>\r\n\r\n       --- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---<p>\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan.

Madina lived all her life in this sunny city and agriculture has been dominant in attracting the residents and profits. For fourteen years Madina and her husband were involved in growing agriculture products from small greens and to tall Uzgen rice which is famous for it's unique taste. After the hard work in the spring and summer comes the bountiful for the farmers autumn. The fertile land of Uzgen and its warm climate bring a rich harvest. During one of these autumns the income of Madina's family had allowed them to buy a small plot of land and to build a house.\r\n\r\nSoon the sowing season will begin and the cycle will begin again. To collect a good harvest taking good care of the land is a must. The fertilizer for such a big area of land can be very costly. Madina has asked for financial assistance from Kiva with this purpose. In the future she wants to raise her children and improve the well being of her family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1600,"image":{"id":729550,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Uzgen","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":135,"posted_date":"2011-03-14T07:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Madina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"\u0420\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043c\u0436\u0430\u043d","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"\u041c\u0430\u0445\u0444\u0443\u0437\u0430","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"\u0424\u0435\u0440\u0443\u0437\u0430\u0445\u043e\u043d","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-02-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":75000,"loan_amount":1600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":6167},{"due_date":"2011-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":6431},{"due_date":"2011-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":6617},{"due_date":"2011-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":7068},{"due_date":"2011-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":7291},{"due_date":"2011-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":7603},{"due_date":"2011-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":7928},{"due_date":"2011-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":8304},{"due_date":"2011-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":8597},{"due_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":8994}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.56},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.2},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.16},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150.78},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":155.55},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.19},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":169.13},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":177.16},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":183.4},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":191.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":131.56,"local_amount":6167,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:35:32Z","rounded_local_amount":6241.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201324296,"comment":null},{"amount":137.2,"local_amount":6431,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:30:29Z","rounded_local_amount":6508.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206192744,"comment":null},{"amount":141.16,"local_amount":6617,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-17T08:03:41Z","rounded_local_amount":6696.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211571548,"comment":null},{"amount":150.78,"local_amount":7068,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:30:12Z","rounded_local_amount":7153.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216546208,"comment":null},{"amount":155.55,"local_amount":7291,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:11:18Z","rounded_local_amount":7378.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221714804,"comment":null},{"amount":162.19,"local_amount":7603,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T09:55:03Z","rounded_local_amount":7694.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227085131,"comment":null},{"amount":169.13,"local_amount":7928,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:45:31Z","rounded_local_amount":8023.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232846794,"comment":null},{"amount":177.16,"local_amount":8304,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:53:36Z","rounded_local_amount":8404.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238661824,"comment":null},{"amount":183.4,"local_amount":8597,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:41:14Z","rounded_local_amount":8700.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244615971,"comment":null},{"amount":191.87,"local_amount":8994,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-18T09:07:20Z","rounded_local_amount":9102.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250831147,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-03-17T01:08:39Z","paid_date":"2012-01-18T09:07:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":280818,"name":"Hou\u00e9noussou Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The Hou\u00e9noussou group consists of thirteen women who all live in the same village and who met each other through one of the group.

Being used to working for the collective good, for Nazarkulovs it was new to start their own business. Anarhan N. is 53 years old, she is a leader of this group. At her husband's initiative was the first to buy 2000 soms worth of cattle for breeding. Because agriculture is a seasonal source of income, animal husbandry turned out to be a good addition to the family's savings account. The winter time is a time off from agriculture, but Anarhan now has to take care of the animals. During winter the animals need special care more than in the summer time when the cattle can take care of itself.\r\n\r\nAnarhan's husband is a hydraulics technician, they have a fifteen year old daughter who is financially dependent on them. Their older son is 25 and works in the Tashkumyrskiy GAO and also provides his share in the development of their family business.\r\n\r\nThe fifteen year term has justified Anarhan's anticipation. At this time the agriculture business together with animal husbandry bring Anarhan around 9500 soms of monthly income. As all the other farmers Anarhan is anxiously waiting for the beginning of the sowing season. The purchase of the fertilizer will be her main expense and this is why she wants to take out the loan.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1750,"image":{"id":729554,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy fertilizer for sowing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Tashkomur","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":135,"posted_date":"2011-03-14T08:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anarhan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"\u041d\u0430\u0437\u0433\u0443\u043b\u044c","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"\u0422\u0443\u0440\u0433\u0443\u043d\u0430\u043b\u0438","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"\u0421\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0431\u0443","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"\u0411\u0443\u0440\u0443\u043b\u043a\u0430\u043d","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"\u0411\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0439","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-02-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":83000,"loan_amount":1750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":8931},{"due_date":"2011-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":9310},{"due_date":"2011-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":9613},{"due_date":"2011-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":10190},{"due_date":"2011-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":10544},{"due_date":"2011-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":10991},{"due_date":"2011-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":11457},{"due_date":"2011-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":11964}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":188.3},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":196.3},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":202.68},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":214.85},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":222.32},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":231.73},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":241.57},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":252.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":188.3,"local_amount":8931,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:35:45Z","rounded_local_amount":8933.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201324297,"comment":null},{"amount":196.3,"local_amount":9310,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:30:43Z","rounded_local_amount":9312.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206192745,"comment":null},{"amount":202.68,"local_amount":9613,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-17T08:03:52Z","rounded_local_amount":9615.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211571549,"comment":null},{"amount":214.85,"local_amount":10190,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:30:26Z","rounded_local_amount":10192.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216546209,"comment":null},{"amount":222.32,"local_amount":10544,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:11:37Z","rounded_local_amount":10546.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221714805,"comment":null},{"amount":231.73,"local_amount":10991,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T09:55:23Z","rounded_local_amount":10993.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227085132,"comment":null},{"amount":241.57,"local_amount":11457,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:45:47Z","rounded_local_amount":11459.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232846795,"comment":null},{"amount":252.25,"local_amount":11964,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:53:55Z","rounded_local_amount":11966.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238661825,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-03-15T22:49:50Z","paid_date":"2011-11-15T10:53:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":280821,"name":"Liberthe","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Liberthe is 41 years old and married with five children who are between 18 and 21 years old.

It is not suprising that she managed to bring together such a good group of entrepreneurs, since she is well known in all of Taskhomer for her success in raising and selling livestock. She warmly remembers buying her very first calf 26 years ago.\r\n\r\nBack then, she was unsure of herself and doubtful of the outcome, but now she is one of the most successful animal farmers in the region. She has a big farm: three cows, 11 calves and 30 goats and sheep. Uulzhan\u2019s husband also has a lot of experience in raising livestock. He is an educator by profession and works as a schoolteacher in Tashkomer. Evenings and weekends he has enough time to prepare animals for sale at the local animal market. Uulzhan\u2019s 16-year old child is the only dependent, as her older children already work. The family invests a large part of their 9,500-som monthly income into buying animal feed. At present they would like to take their business to the next level and to increase their livestock. Uulzhan puts her trust in this loan, which will allow her buy more animals and expand her farm.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1600,"image":{"id":729558,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Tashkomur","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":135,"posted_date":"2011-03-18T09:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Uulzhan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"\u0410\u043b\u0438\u043c\u0431\u0443","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"\u041a\u0430\u043b\u0438\u044f","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0442","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-02-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":75000,"loan_amount":1600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":8070},{"due_date":"2011-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":8413},{"due_date":"2011-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":8686},{"due_date":"2011-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":9208},{"due_date":"2011-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":9528},{"due_date":"2011-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":9932},{"due_date":"2011-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":10353},{"due_date":"2011-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":10810}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":172.16},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.48},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":185.3},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":196.44},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":203.26},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":211.88},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":220.87},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":230.61}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":172.16,"local_amount":8070,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:35:58Z","rounded_local_amount":8167.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201324298,"comment":null},{"amount":179.48,"local_amount":8413,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:30:57Z","rounded_local_amount":8514.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206192746,"comment":null},{"amount":185.3,"local_amount":8686,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-17T08:04:16Z","rounded_local_amount":8790.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211571550,"comment":null},{"amount":196.44,"local_amount":9208,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:30:41Z","rounded_local_amount":9318.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216546210,"comment":null},{"amount":203.26,"local_amount":9528,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:11:49Z","rounded_local_amount":9642.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221714806,"comment":null},{"amount":211.88,"local_amount":9932,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T09:56:23Z","rounded_local_amount":10051.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227085133,"comment":null},{"amount":220.87,"local_amount":10353,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:44:23Z","rounded_local_amount":10477.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232846796,"comment":null},{"amount":230.61,"local_amount":10810,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:52:15Z","rounded_local_amount":10940.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238661826,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-03-20T11:16:25Z","paid_date":"2011-11-15T10:52:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":280823,"name":"Angela","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Sra.

She plans to invest this loan in rearing pigs, selling local beer called \"sha\" produced from corn, and selling firewood. In the production of Piglets and firewood, she will be able to raise a lot of profit from the business because they are highly demanded in her community. She believes the business will succeed because she has been in the business for a long time and has experience as far as the business is concerned. \n\nShe also thinks her approach to her customers will be captivating and hence lead to the success of her business. The loan will help her community because they will be able to afford at least good pigs (pock meat) for their meals, and the North West region of Cameroon respects pigs (pock meat) a lot to carry out their traditional rites. So her business will be sustainable. And also, she will provide her community with good firewood which they will use as fuel for cooking.\n\nH. will plough back her profit into her business and use part to care for her family. She also will use the proceeds to pay her children's school fees and save some for rainy days. She prefers GHAPE because of the training she frequently receives and the low cost in obtaining and paying back the loan.\n\nAbout GHAPE \n\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.

Ahamada has been operating a business farming and selling coffee for the past decade in Buyiri-Katete in Mukono. The happily married father of four says he was inspired by one of his closest friends to try a hand at this business, which can be lucrative if one works at it with determination.

She tells us that it has was very hard to study since she had to travel to another city to do so. \r\n\r\nWith a lot of sacrifice and the help of her parents, she was able to finish her studies in 4 years.   After finishing her degree she began to look for a place to work, to be able to cover expenses for herself and her daughter.  After not being able to find anything, she began looking for clients on her own, and has managed to attract quite a few.  She now works comfortably from her home. \r\n\r\nShe came to our institution because she needed to buy a computer to be able to complete some of her accounting jobs.

T. is 29 years old and makes his own traditional handicrafts.  He weaves hammocks and bags in different styles based on what customers see in magazines which he also uses for marketing purposes.  Based on family tradition, Edgar began his business in 2004 when he studied agricultural business administration.  He was unable to find a job and decided to use his entrepreneurial and artistic skills and aptitude.\r\n\r\nHe has received two loans through the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, including his crediKiva, which he will use to purchase materials to make hammocks and bags.  The investment is bound to be successful because already has taken orders from customers.  Because of his lack of capital, Edgar usually does not keep an inventory of products so he must supply orders by paying a higher price for materials which means less profit.\r\n\r\nSince receiving his first loan through the Foundation he has been able to increase his earnings and buy a machine to make the bags.

They live in their own home which is located in Sangani in the Peruvian central forest.  He works in public transportation in the different streets of the town of Pichanaki.  He has been doing this for three years.  He used to work with his mother's motorcycle but over time, with hard work, he was able to buy his own vehicle and now has a higher income.\r\n\r\nWhat he likes about his job is that it is independent.  One of the drawbacks, however, is that when the motorcyle is out of order he spends time getting it repaired and loses money.\r\n\r\nHis wife, Cleofe, has a grocery store and sells basic needs items, so she also helps cover houshold expenses.  The main difficulties they have are paying for education and food for the children his wife has from a previous relationship.\r\n\r\n\"When you work hard you can make a good profit.\", he says.

All have a great desire for a better future. They live in a densely populated neighbourhood in the north part of the city.\r\n\r\nEver since she was young, Josefa has earned her living by selling the traditional food and drink of northern Peru. She learned by watching how her mother mixed the different ingredients resulting in delicious soups. Then the years passed and eventually Josefa started her own business in a wholesale market in the area where she lives. She rents a stall there.

Como es una mujer emprendedora para el futuro tiene planeado comprar una carretilla para empezar a vender jugos de naranja ya que se ha enterado que este negocio es muy productivo. \n\nOlga tiene planeado invertir el dinero solicitado en la compra de ingredientes al por mayor que le hacen falta para seguir adelante en su negocio. \n\nEs el segundo cr\u00e9dito que tiene con MFP y promete pagar sus cuotas puntualmente, pues no quiere quedar mal con las personas que hicieron posible el dinero que le permitir\u00e1 continuar trabajando en busca del progreso. ","en":"Olga, 38, lives in a house she owns with her four children, the two youngest of whom are still her responsibility.  Her two oldest children work and can support themselves, but all of them work together for the good of the family.\r\n\r\nOlga has operated a business making and selling prepared meals (\"platillos diarios\") for a group of 15 local workers for more than a year.  She gets up early every day to prepare the meals and, when they're ready, delivers them to the market where her customers work.  She works from Monday to Saturday, only taking off on Sunday to rest.  She is happy with the business because it's stable and her earnings from it cover her family's expenses.  Before setting up this business, Olga worked as a dispatcher for a taxi business, a job that she found very wearing.  She's an enterprising woman, though, and now she wants to buy a cart so that she can start selling orange juice, a business that she thinks will be very profitable.  \r\n\r\nOlga will use this loan to buy the supplies she needs to run her business.\r\n\r\nThis is Olga's second MFP loan and she is committed to repaying it on time.  She doesn't want to disappoint the people who make these loans possible and allow her to continue working and getting ahead in the world."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":720079,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"Buy supplies for food business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-03-11T19:48:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Olga","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-02-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":150.62},{"due_date":"2011-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":160.27},{"due_date":"2011-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":163.87},{"due_date":"2011-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":169.6},{"due_date":"2011-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":175.13},{"due_date":"2011-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":180.51}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.48},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.1},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.46},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.6},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.69}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":116.58,"local_amount":310.89,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:31:30Z","rounded_local_amount":322.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206196363,"comment":null},{"amount":61.46,"local_amount":163.87,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:41:45Z","rounded_local_amount":170.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211270044,"comment":null},{"amount":63.69,"local_amount":169.84,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:32:45Z","rounded_local_amount":176.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216550063,"comment":null},{"amount":133.27,"local_amount":355.4,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:13:25Z","rounded_local_amount":369.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221718737,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-03-16T06:05:00Z","paid_date":"2011-08-15T09:13:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":280986,"name":"Ana","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ana tiene 41 a\u00f1os, vive en compa\u00f1\u00eda de uno de sus 3 hijos y su esposo en casa de su madre.
