His shop is open from 7am until 5pm every day. \r\n\r\nFresixan is the leader of a group called \"Jyambere\" in the local language. The group includes five members (four men and one woman) and five businesses, including a spare parts business and a business selling cakes.  The group has requested a loan from Kiva lenders, via Vision Finance Company, in order to purchase more products for their shops so that they can provide better service to their customers. The loan will impact the group members by helping them to purchase larger quantities of stock, which will allow them to earn more profits. With the extra income they all earn, Fresixan and his group hope to save some money and to reinvest in their businesses.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":708878,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from providing general services to local community members. Ernesta has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 1000 PHP per month.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Ernesta joined Kiva partner Paglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) to gain access to financial services that would help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Ernesta has successfully repaid a previous PMPC loan of 5000 PHP. The previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory and working capital. Ernesta is requesting a new loan of 7000 PHP that will be used to invest in expanding her business. This loan will be the third loan Ernesta has taken out from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

He is 47 years old and the group leader of a 9-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Rodolfo T. group.\r\n\r\nRodolfo is married and has 4 school-aged children. He owns and operates a business raising livestock, primarily pigs, for fattening and sale. Rodolfo has been engaged in his business for over 5 years and earns approximately 4,500 PHP when he sells one of his raised animals.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Rodolfo joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Rodolfo has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from ASKI, which was used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. Rodolfo is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will again be used to purchase feed and other supplies. This will be the 5th loan taken out by Rodolfo from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand his business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva

Loraleen has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 7000 PHP a month for these activities.<p>\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Loraleen joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Loraleen has successfully repaid a previous loan of 15,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Loraleen is requesting a new loan of 20000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand her store's product offering. This loan will be Loraleen's 4th loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business, to improve the general living conditions of her family. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

She earns her living by operating a general store. Her husband Bernadito, who is 65 years old, works as a laborer to earn his living.  They have nine children who are 25 to 43 years old. \r\n\r\nMaria joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of 9 previous loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Maria has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her last loan of 19,500 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 6,500 PHP, improving her family's standard of living.  This time, for her 10th loan, she is borrowing 25,000 PHP, which she intends to use to purchase additional stock for her general store.  She hopes the additional income will help her continue to save up for house repair. Maria is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"Honorable\"). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

M. is a widow who lives in Brgy. Mantija, Danao City, Cebu. She earns her living by operating a used clothing business.  Remedios joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2009 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 3 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Remedios has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 9,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 14,000.00, uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 4th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 11,000.00 which she intends to use to buy more supplies of used clothes to sell so that she could continue to save up for future savings and expansion of her business. Remedios is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She is 50 years old. Elizabeth is the group leader of a 2-member group loan offered by GDMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nElizabeth is separated from spouse and has 1 school-aged child. To make a living, Elizabeth owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector operating a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of food products in the local community. Elizabeth has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 2500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Elizabeth joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Elizabeth is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Elizabeth from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":706561,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to invest in expanding the business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Lopez Jaena Misamis Occidental","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":136,"posted_date":"2011-02-10T12:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Madeline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-01-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":250,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:54:03Z","rounded_local_amount":10876.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221679324,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-02-16T14:03:00Z","paid_date":"2011-08-15T08:54:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":271803,"name":"Mary  Ngina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"For  four  years,  Mary Ngina  N.  has  been selling clothes and also practices crop farming  in Emali town, earning an income of KES  10,200.

M. is a married woman who lives in Puerto Princesa City, Palawan. She earns her living by a operating general store.\r\n\r\nHer husband, Rey, who is 38 years old, works as a businessman to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.  \r\n\r\nThey have three children who are between 3 and 14 years old. \r\n\r\nNora joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired to something better for her family. With the help of her past 16 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Nora has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. \r\n\r\nHer previous loan of PHP 14,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 17th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 20,000, with which she intends to buy more grocery items to sell so that she can continue to save up for future improvements to the business and the education of her children. \r\n\r\nNora is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\"). NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon, a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is 'Marigold'.\r\n\r\nHoneylyn is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Honeylyn owns & operates a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling seafood products  including fish and shrimp in the local community. Honeylyn has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 3000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Honeylyn joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Honeylyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. Honeylyn is requesting a new loan of 9000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the second loan taken out by Honeylyn from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

They all live together in their own home in the community of Santa Rosa in the department of Ayacucho.  Aurelio is a hardworking man who strives to provide his family with prosperity.  He is a farmer who has 4 hectares of land where he cultivates coca leaves, cocoa and coffee.  He has worked for 13 years, and states that he still enjoys this work, since he can work independently.  During the harvest season he hires workers to help him harvest the cocoa and coca leaves, products that are purchased by the wholesale companies that give him good profits.  What he considers to be most difficult is to move the products from the harvest to the drying area.  In the future, he hopes to gather together more money to buy new lands and to cultivate new crops such as bananas and pineapples.  This is his first loan with MFP, and he feels that this support will help him a lot to make progress with his business.

Saving and getting small loans she began to raise an investment capital, and she was able to get her own small store in the market, which she used to sell baby clothing. \r\n\r\nShe then had her son and she decided to open a small restaurant close to her house, so she can look after her baby. \r\n\r\nToday, her small restaurant has pretty good clientele and she could also open a new store in the market where she sells woman clothing and underwear.  She says that the credit given to support her two businesses help to generate income to her house, which could provide better opportunities to her son in his life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":709854,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food
