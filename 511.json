She lives in a simple structure with her long-term partner. She says that her most difficult challenge is building her house.  She plans to continue enjoying her profession of teaching, especially teaching children.\r\n\r\nYuri is excited to be taking out her second loan with Esperanza after having successfully repaid her previous loan and grown her business. She has had her business for 12 years, starting out with her own savings. She operates a small school where she teaches kids early in their childhood.  Yuri plans to use this loan to invest in her business, buying books, chairs, notebooks, and other school supplies. She will use the profits to invest in the school by building a new classroom.  Her dream is to have her own school with more courses. \r\n\r\nThis Esperanza associate started the program for the benefits to her business.  Her story is representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican clients generally.  Many of the group's Dominican clients recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti.\r\n\r\nYuri's group is located in the rural area surrounding La Romana, where the sugarcane harvest and tourist industry dominates the economy. This area, like nearly all impoverished areas of the Dominican Republic, suffers from unreliable electricity and unreliable running water that is not safe to

He is a farmer and his wife educates the children who are still quite young to work in the fields.\r\n\r\nHe tells us that his crops aren\u2019t very large so he also went into being a mototaxi driver because his children\u2019s school expenses are quite high.  His family is quite humble but very unified and that\u2019s why they want to continue working to gradually improve their quality of life.  He is in the 2 de Agosto transportation syndicate in Ivirgarzama; he\u2019s been an active member for 3 years now.  The service he provides is profitable because of the high number of people who request it due to its ease, speed and efficiency.

L. is 35 years old.  She lives in Ahuachap\u00e1n department with her husband who sells watches.  She also lives with her two children aged 9 and 11.\r\n\r\nOlga sells women's and men's clothes.  She also sells shoes, sandals and maternity clothes.  Her business is located in the center of Ahuachap\u00e1n.  She starts work at 8.00am and finishes at 6.30pm.  She has a lot of competition since there are a number of different types of sales businesses here.  Most are businesses which sell clothes and their prices are very competitive.  For this reason, Olga is requesting a loan so that she can increase her inventory and thereby have the necessary money to buy wholesale, obtaining her clothes and shoes at lower prices so that she can sell them more cheaply.

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Prescilla E. is from the village of San Pedro. She is 50 years old. Prescilla is the group leader of a 4-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Prescilla E..\r\n\r\nPrescilla is married and has 3 adult children. To make a living, Prescilla owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector running a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Prescilla has been engaged in her business for over 4 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Prescilla joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Prescilla has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Prescilla is requesting a new loan of 11000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand product offering. This loan will be the 4th loan taken out by Prescilla from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

The official name of this borrowing group is Nancy G.\u2019s Group.\r\n<p>\r\nNancy runs a general store from which she sells a variety of different products to the local community.

B. is a 49-year-old married woman who supports her family by operating two business ventures: food vending and hair cutting businesses. She lives in Purok Linasgasan, Brgy Bato, Sagay City, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2001 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. \r\n\r\nBy working hard in her food vending and hair cutting businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable.  She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 3,000. Jean is now borrowing PHP 10,000 so that she can purchase raw materials for food vending. This will be her 12th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP10,000 which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom.  \r\n\r\nJean aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the  Dungganon way.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

With the help of her past 15 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Lucy  has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow.

She lives in Purok Dungcaan, Barangay Bulanon, Sagay City, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 1994 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts.  By working hard in her fish vending\/fishing businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of about $229. \r\n\r\nMercedita is borrowing 24,000 PHP to use as additional capital and to purchase fishing supplies. This will be her 17th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon.  Her previous loan of 21,000 PHP, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom.  Mercedita aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nThis photo was taken after the center meeting, because fish were delivered early in the morning.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She lives in Purok Mahogany, Barangay Vito, Sagay City, Negros Occidental.  She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2006 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts.  By working hard in her food vending and dried fish businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable.  She now earns an average monthly income of about $184. \r\n\r\nNenita is now borrowing 25,000 PHP to use as additional capital for her business. This will be her 11th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon.  Her previous loan of 23,000 PHP, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom.  Nenita aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well being by following the Dungganon way.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

F. is a 41-year-old married woman who supports her family by operating a fish vending \/ fishing business. She lives in Talusan, Brgy Bulanon, Sagay City, Negros Occidental.  She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 1992 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts.  \r\n\r\nBy working hard in her fish vending\/fishing business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable.  She now earns an average monthly income of PHP8,000.  Sotera is borrowing PHP 29,500 so that she can purchase materials and do repairs on her pump boat. \r\n\r\nThis will be her 17th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon.  Her previous loan of PHP29,500, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom.  Sotera aspires to improve her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon -- a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Talaban, Himamaylan City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures: fishing and food vending businesses. Letecia joined Kiva partner, NWTF-Project Dungganon, in 1994 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 23 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Letecia has been gradually lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 24,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 12,000 PHP, thus raising the family's standard of living.  \r\n<br>This time, for her 24th loan, she is borrowing 25,000 PHP, which she intends to use to repair and maintain her fishing boat so that she could continue to save up for the future expansion of her business and education of her children. Letecia B. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n<p>\r\n<b> About NWTF<\/b><br>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means 'honorable').

She lives in Brgy. 4, Himamaylan City, Negros Occidental.  She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2006 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts.  \r\n\r\nBy working hard in her general store, rice dealer and cafeteria businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable.  She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 23,000.  Carmen is now borrowing PHP 18,000 so that she  can purchase more stock to sell.  This will be her 8th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 17,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom.  \r\n\r\nCarmen aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\n In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

J. is a married woman who lives in Sitio Batang, Brgy. Talaban, Himamaylan City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating three business ventures:   general store, fishing and food vending businesses.  Her husband Larry J., who is 47 years old, works as a driver to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have four children who are 19 to 25 years old.  \r\n\r\nJocelyn joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1994 because she aspired for something better for her family.  With the help of her past 19 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Jocelyn has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 29,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6,500, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 20th loan, she is borrowing PHP 29,500 which she intends to use to buy stock for the general store so that she can continue to save up for the future expansion of her business and the education of her children.  Jocelyn J. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\n In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

He started his own studio where he provides services such as still and motion photography, video taping for parties and weddings and producing advertisements for companies.\r\n\r\nTaghreed came to FATEN for a loan as her husband would like to purchase a new camera and lighting accessories. Taghreed's husband Anas is pictured in the studio as Taghreed is a conservative woman.\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

Her previous loan of PHP 21,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.

C. is a 55-year old widow who lives in Purok Starapple, Brgy Vito, Sagay City, Negros Occidental.  She supports her family by operating a business of buying and selling dried fish. \r\n\r\nShe has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 1994 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her dried fish business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of 8000. Virginia is requesting a loan of PHP 21000 so she can purchase more stock for sale. Her photograph was taken during the center meeting because the stock of dried fish was already sent to buyers early in the morning.<p>\r\n\r\nThis will be her new loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 19500, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom.  Virginia aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and insure their future well being, by following the Dungganon way. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.Help NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by clicking  the link to the  NWTF Kiva lending team  on Kiva.org to join our

To making a living, T. owns & operates a food stall, primarily selling rice products in the local community.  T. has been engaged in this business for over 6 years and earns approximately 4,000,000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, T. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. T. has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6,048,000 VND from SEDA. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. T. is now requesting a new loan of 8,288,000 VND which will be used to purchase additional inventory & used towards working capital. This will be the 5th loan taken out by T. from SEDA. T. plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\nAbout SEDA:\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to the low income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the Northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and to reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

\u0110\u1ed7 Th\u1ecb (20201020015) is a 57 year-old female living in the town of huy\u1ec7n Y\u00ean Phong - B\u1eafc Ninh. She is married and has 3 adult children. To making a living, T. owns & operates a general store, selling a variety of different products in the local community. T. has been engaged in this business for over 21 years and earns approximately 3,200,000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, T. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. T. has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6,048,000 VND from SEDA. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. T. is now requesting a new loan of 8,288,000 VND which will be used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. This will be the 5th loan taken out by T. from SEDA. T. plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her own family.\r\n\r\nAbout SEDA:\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to the low income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the Northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\nT. \u0110\u1ed7 Th\u1ecb (20201020015) l\u00e0 57 tu\u1ed5i n\u1eef.

She lives in Purok Dalisay, Brgy Bulanon, Sagay City, Negros Occidental.  She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2000 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. \r\n\r\n By working hard in her food vending business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable.  She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 8,000.  Juliet is now borrowing PHP 20,000 so that she can purchase raw materials.  This will be her 12th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 19,500, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom.  \r\n\r\nJuliet aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way.  Her photo was taken during the center meeting because all of her food was already sold out.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She earns her living by operating two business ventures: dried fish vending and fishing businesses.  Her husband Jose B., who is 51 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have eight children who are 7 to 29 years old. \r\n\r\n Narcisa joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 11 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Narcisa has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 24,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 12th loan, she is borrowing PHP 27,000 which she intends to use to purchase more stock to sell so that she can continue to save up for the future and sustain their daily needs. \r\n\r\nNarcisa B. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Her previous loan of PHP 13,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom.  Rosario aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the  Dungganon way.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

N. is a married woman who lives in Brgy. Daanglungsod, Oslob, Cebu. She earns her living by operating one business venture: a pig fattening business. Her husband Hipolito N., who is 49 years old, works as a tricycle (three-wheeled transport) driver to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have four children who are 3 to 16 years old.  \r\n\r\nGemma joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2006 because she aspired for something better for her family.  With the help of her past 7 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Gemma has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 5,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 8th loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000 which she intends to use to fund her business operations so that she can continue to save up for the future, support the family and do house repairs.  Gemma N. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\n In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

A decade is the period of time he has been running his charcoal, firewood and beef sales businesses in Lutengo-Mukono. Credit for the setting up of this business, he says, goes to his father who, he says, offered him not only financial support but also moral support.

Obo, Dalaguete, Cebu.  She earns her living by operating one business venture: buying and selling vegetables. Her husband Maximiano R., who is 49 years old, works as a motorcycle driver (\"habal-habal\") to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have five children who are 10 to 23 years old.  \r\n\r\nRestituta  joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired for something better for her family.  With the help of her past 10 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Restituta  has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 8,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 12,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 11th loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000 which she intends to use as additional business capital so that she can continue to save up for the future of her children.  \r\n\r\nRestituta  R. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Isroil is 54 years old and lives with his wife and six children. He has been a farmer for 17 years, ever since his marriage. His job allows him to support his family, and this is why he works so hard and with such determination. He grows onions and wheat, and he is committed to produce a high-quality crop. In general, his output is in high demand, but he spends a lot of money on the fertilizers that are necessary for good yield. This is Isroil\u2019s first loan through IMON International, and he plans to use it to buy seeds, fertilizer, fuels and lubricants.  \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

Abdukarim is 44 years old, married and has four children. He makes a living by selling cattle and providing transportation services.

Because he has been in this business for five years, he knows a lot about which animals to choose, the best ways to breed them and how to care for them. His work requires him to get up early every morning in order to feed his animals and look after them, but it also allows him to generate an ample and stable income for his large family. Abdukarim knows that the price of cattle is low now but believes it will increase in the future, which is why he has applied for this loan, for $3,000, to enlarge his herd.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History: Since December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She lives in her own home with her 3 beloved children who are her motivation to work hard.  Reveca works hard on her farm which has enabled her to improve her crops and make her land more productive.  Together with her eldest daughter, she works from very early in the morning, growing cacao, coffee and coca leaf.  These are products which she will later take to sell in the city of San Francisco.  What she most likes about her work is sowing her crops and watching them grow.  She has been in this business for 10 years and considers the most difficult part of her work to be spraying her crops since the chemicals that she uses to get rid of insects can affect her health.  Over time, she hopes to buy more land and thereby expand her production.\r\n\r\nThis is Reveca's first loan with MFP.  She knows that she has to make her loan repayments punctually and she is ready to do so since she would like to be able to access further loans in the future.

has been in the farming business for the last ten years. His mixed farm, which is located in Kitale town, western Kenya, produces milk and eggs which he sells to the local market. He mainly depends on the income from his farming activities to cater for the basic needs of his family. His biggest challenge has been diseases and difficulties in transporting his products to the local market. \r\n\r\nHe has requested this loan from Kiva partner Juhudi Kilimo of 31,200 KES in order to purchase and insure a dairy cow. He says that his milk production will improve and that his family will have enough milk for domestic consumption and sale.

For this reason, when he takes his cacao, coffee and coca leaf to the city of San Francisco to sell, he obtains very good prices because of the good quality of his products.\r\n\r\nWhat Eduardo most likes about his work is sowing his land and making it fertile.  He has been in this business for 45 years and he considers the most difficult part of his work being protecting his crops against insect infestations which can damage them.  Over time, he would like to acquire more land in other areas so that he can increase his production and vary his crops.\r\n\r\nThis is Eduardo's second loan with MFP.  He knows that he must make his loan repayments on time if he wants to be able to access another loan in the future.  He will use the 2,000 Peruvian soles he is requesting to buy more manure and fertilizers to improve his land."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":661465,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy manure and fertilizers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-12-09T19:10:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eduardo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":170.99},{"due_date":"2011-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":174.8},{"due_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":179.16},{"due_date":"2011-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":192.86},{"due_date":"2011-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":196.11},{"due_date":"2011-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":202.98},{"due_date":"2011-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":209.03},{"due_date":"2011-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":217.4},{"due_date":"2011-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":224.46},{"due_date":"2011-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":232.21}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.98},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.37},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.94},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.92},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.09},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.58},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.77},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.81},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.36},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.18}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":71.75,"local_amount":197.94,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:03:37Z","rounded_local_amount":202.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188725501,"comment":null},{"amount":66.41,"local_amount":183.2,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:41:42Z","rounded_local_amount":187.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191463618,"comment":null},{"amount":59.63,"local_amount":164.5,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:53:03Z","rounded_local_amount":168.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195887000,"comment":null},{"amount":67.07,"local_amount":185.03,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:38:01Z","rounded_local_amount":189.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201327356,"comment":null},{"amount":72.27,"local_amount":199.36,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:33:35Z","rounded_local_amount":203.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206195921,"comment":null},{"amount":67.75,"local_amount":186.87,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:41:53Z","rounded_local_amount":191.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211269590,"comment":null},{"amount":77.21,"local_amount":213,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:32:38Z","rounded_local_amount":217.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216549589,"comment":null},{"amount":79.22,"local_amount":218.55,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:13:17Z","rounded_local_amount":223.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221718327,"comment":null},{"amount":85.21,"local_amount":235.05,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:12:53Z","rounded_local_amount":240.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227349894,"comment":null},{"amount":78.48,"local_amount":216.5,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:48:46Z","rounded_local_amount":221.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232850486,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-12-21T16:56:51Z","paid_date":"2011-10-15T09:48:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":256461,"name":"Velky Dinora","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"la sra.

She lives in a modest home with one of her three children. She says that her most difficult challenges are to work hard and to educate her kids. In the meantime she plans to continue to enjoy sharing with friends and cooking for them.\n\nLucrecia is excited to be taking out her 6th loan with Esperanza after having successfully repaid her previous loan and grown her business. She has had her business for almost 5 years, starting with her first loan through Esperanza, which was close to $80 US. She plans to use this loan to invest in her business by buying bottles of oil, small bags of rice, canned food, etc. She prepares small bags or packages of basic cooking ingredients like oil, rice, flour or canned goods, and sells them to her clients on credit. She collects repayments from her clients every 15 days, at which point they can buy more products on credit. She will re-invest the profits in her business. She dreams of having her own house and better conditions.\n\nThis Esperanza associate began with us because she needed to do business and her story is representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican clients generally, many of whom recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti.
