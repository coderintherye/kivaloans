Arlyn has been engaged in her business for over six years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Arlyn joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Arlyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6,000 PHP from HSPFI. Arlyn is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Arlyn from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to support her children's education. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

M. is 51 years-old and happily married to her husband, Sebastian M., 52 years-old. May, their only child, is now 24 years-old. Luningning is a little depressed that May only obtained a low level of education because of a lack of money for tuition fees and other expenses, and the sad part of it is that she settled down at a young age. Luningning doesn't want this to happen to her grandchildren which is why she has promised herself that she will help May in the education of her children.\r\n<p>\r\nOne source of their income is from the salary received by her husband who works as a laborer.  However, although her husband tries hard to earn enough income for them it ends up not being enough. Luningning persists in helping her husband and manages many businesses. She is now focusing on buying and selling detergent soap bars and powder. As a matter of fact, she plans to use the loan that she hopes to receive from Kiva field partner Ahon sa Hirap Inc. (ASHI) to buy all the necessary things needed for this business.  Other than this business, she also sells dried fish and makes bamboo sticks for extra income.\r\n<p>\r\nLuningning never tires of thinking what possible business will contribute to their income because she really wants to improve their way of living. She wants to renovate their house into a much better one but also her main reason for not getting tired is she hopes that, unlike their mother, all her grandchildren will finish their studies up to

Rosalinda has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 8,000 PHP a month.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2008, Rosalinda joined Kiva partner GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Rosalinda has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Rosalinda is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Rosalinda from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n<p>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

L. is from the village of Tagulalo, Aurora, Zamboanga del sur. She is 29 years old. Mirasol is married and has five school-aged children. To make a living, she operates a manufacturing business. The main source of income for the business comes from manufacturing and selling bamboo products to local businesses and community members. Mirasol has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 3,000 Philippine pesos a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Mirasol joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Mirasol has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase raw materials to manufacture additional products. Mirasol is requesting a new loan of 3,000 PHP, which will also be used to purchase additional raw materials to expand her product offering. This will be the second loan taken out by Mirasol from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

T. is from the village of Baclay, Tukuran Zamboanga del sur.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of products in the local community. Perpetua has been engaged in her business for over one year and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2007, Perpetua joined Kiva partner GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Perpetua has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to invest in renovating the business. Perpetua is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Perpetua from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n<p>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

O. is from the village of Baclay, Tukuran Zamboanga Del Sur. She is 49 years old. Corazon is married and has 8 adult children. To make a living, Corazon owns and operates a specialized store. The main source of income for the business comes from selling nipa hut products to the community. \r\n\r\nIn 2007, Corazon joined GDMPC in order to gain access to financial services that could help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Corazon has already successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to invest in expanding the business. Corazon is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Corazon from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's general living conditions.\r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

M.  is from the village of Butuay.

The main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Meriam has been engaged in her business for over 19 years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Meriam joined PMPC in order to gain access to financial services that could help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Meriam has successfully repaid a previous loan from PMPC. Meriam is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory and be used as working capital. This loan will be the 7th loan taken out by Meriam from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's general living conditions.\r\n\r\nAbout PMPC: \r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

R. is from the village of Cabol-anonan, Tudela, Misamis Occidental. She is 41 years old. Merly is married and has a school-aged child. To make a living, Merly owns and runs a general store. The main source of income for the business comes from selling products such as shampoo, soap and toothpaste in the community. Merly has been engaged in her business for over 1 years and earns approximately 1,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Merly joined PMPC in order to gain access to financial services that could help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Merly has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Merly is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory and be used as working capital. This loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by Merly from PMPC.

Bernadette has successfully repaid a previous loan from PMPC. Bernadette is requesting a new loan of 30000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be her twelfth loan from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n<p>\r\nNote: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

M. is from the village of Locsoon, Tudela, Misamis Occidental. She is 46 years old and married with two school-aged children. To make a living, Antonia owns and operates a general store, selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap and toothpaste in the local community. She has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately $45 a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Antonia joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used for working capital to purchase additional inventory. Antonia is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be her eighth loan from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

C., 52 years old, is married to Danilo C. who is the same age. They have four children: Julius Bryan, 27; Dennis, 26; April Abegail, 25; and Sarah Jane, 23. Melinda and Danilo are proud parents because poverty has never been a hindrance for their children to finish their studies. All of their children are college graduates, which is the happy result of their hardship. However, it never ends, because what they want now is to make their fishing business continue to grow. This is important to them because this business has been providing for their family for 26 years.\r\n\r\nDanilo is a fisherman and he manages the fishing business. Melinda helps him by selling the fish that he catches in the sea to the market or to their neighborhood. Their dilemma is that their fishing boat that her husband uses in catching fish in the sea was damaged by Typhoon Ondoy (Ketsana) that entered into the area of the Philippines. Now, instead of buying a new boat, they want to build their own boat so that they can be sure that it is more durable. They will use the loan that Melinda will receive through the Kiva field partner, Ahon sa Hirap Inc. (ASHI), to buy materials for building a fishing boat.\r\n\r\nWhat Melinda hopes right now is that their business will continue to run, because this has been their life. They love what they do in making the business grow."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":415962,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","use":"To build a fishing

She is married to Dominador T., who works as a seaman at an international liner to provide a better future for his family. They are blessed with two young elementary school age children, ages nine and 11.\r\n\r\nBefore her husband worked as a seaman, Juvy was very worried about her family's situation.  She was afraid that she would not be able to send their children to school.  She started a general store in a high pedestrian area and as her business grew, she needed additional capital to expand.  Juvy joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2003 and with loans she was able to expansion and support her family.  She even started selling gasoline in her community, which is far from the nearest gasoline station.\r\n \r\nEven with regular income from her husband, Juvy continued to rely on NWTF-PD as her capital source so she could borrow money.   She enjoys the camaraderie with her group and center mates as well as the benefits: insurance and a savings program as well as business advice and training.\r\n\r\nBecause of their hard work and dedication, Juvy and Dominador have overcome most of their problems. The business is earning good income.  She was able to move to a more permanent structure, and they bought a truck which they hire out to other people to earn income. Her business now earns an average monthly income of PHP 20,000 which is quite enough to meet the needs of their family with some savings left over for the future educational needs of their children.\r\n\r\nPreviously she borrowed Php 19,500 for her general store and gasoline business. Her loan was fully paid without any delays and she was able to maintain her good credit record at NWTF-Project Dungganon.  Now for her 12th loan, she is borrowing the same amount to continue expanding her business and to save for future emergencies.\r\n--------------------------\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women.

She started to develop this business after inheriting some of the livestock from her parents.  Burmabubu familiarized herself well with this trade since childhood and experienced no real difficulties with continuing the family business.  Her husband\u2019s specialty is a bit different.  He works as a physical education teacher at a secondary school.  Together, they raised five children.  The oldest daughter is thirty years old.  The youngest son is twenty-one.  Both of the daughters are married and live separately.  Two of the sons work in Bishkek, and one works for the police and lives with the parents.  All of the children and the husband help Burmabubu with the household business as much as possible.  Burmabubu\u2019s and her family\u2019s joint effort enabled them to build a big house and a barn.  The business that Burmabubu developed played a significant role in marrying off the daughters and also marrying the sons.  Burmabubu earns 1700 som ($40) per month just from milk sales.  Burmabubu\u2019s current main goal is to marry her youngest son.  However, she has to get well prepared for this by increasing the livestock headcount.  She decided to request a loan and purchase two calves for this purpose.\r\n<p>\r\nBurmabubu\u2019s group also includes Damira B., Ulbosyn A. and Darya K..\r\n<p>\r\nDamira B. is almost sixty years old.  Damira is a mother of six children.  Out of all the children, only the youngest daughter lives with the parents.  Damira is involved in animal husbandry, even though many people her age stay home and get cared for by their children.  Damira also sells milk, which allows her to fully provide for her daily needs.  Her income from milk sales is no more and no less than two thousand eight hundred som.  Damira needs a loan in order to purchase two rams.\r\n<p>\r\nUlbosyn A. is forty-seven years old.  Together with her husband, Ulbosyn is already involved in animal husbandry, sales of livestock and also sale of milk.  Their monthly income is about ten thousand som.  This is approximately one seventh of their original contribution.  Ulbosyn wants to obtain a loan and purchase four sheep.  In the future, she plans to breed sheep in a shed and use the income from sale of livestock to educate her daughter abroad.\r\n<p>\r\nDarya K. is forty-seven years old.  She raised three children.  Together with her sons, Darya breeds livestock and is involved in livestock sales, and also sells milk.  Thanks to animal husbandry, Darya raised her children without real difficulties and improved her quality of life.  She educated her children how to correctly take care of livestock and is slowly transitioning the business to them.  Darya decided to obtain a loan with the goal of purchasing four sheep for breeding.          <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Anna Sorokina-Hailey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":415976,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy two calves","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Karabalta","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":135,"posted_date":"2009-10-28T18:30:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Burmabubu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Damira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ulbosyn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Darya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":47000,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":6947},{"due_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":7279},{"due_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":7680},{"due_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":7955},{"due_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":8376},{"due_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":8763}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":162.59},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":170.36},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":179.74},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":186.18},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":196.04},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":162.59,"local_amount":6947,"processed_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:49:14Z","rounded_local_amount":7080.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103838984,"comment":null},{"amount":170.36,"local_amount":7279,"processed_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:17:09Z","rounded_local_amount":7419.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110730770,"comment":null},{"amount":179.74,"local_amount":7680,"processed_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:08:48Z","rounded_local_amount":7827.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118121317,"comment":null},{"amount":186.18,"local_amount":7955,"processed_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:46:58Z","rounded_local_amount":8108.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123956971,"comment":null},{"amount":196.04,"local_amount":8376,"processed_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-21T07:41:52Z","rounded_local_amount":8537.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128989777,"comment":null},{"amount":205.09,"local_amount":8763,"processed_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:35:54Z","rounded_local_amount":8931.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136715589,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-10-29T05:02:53Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T11:35:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":148369,"name":"Elsei","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elsei P. is from the village of Esperanza, Kinoguitan Misamis Oriental.

She earns 8500 PHP monthly from her business. \r\n<p>\r\nIn 2006, Nora joined PMPC to access their programs and services. Currently she's requesting her 5th loan, for 50000 PHP, that she will use as additional capital for her hog-raising business.\r\n<em><p>\r\nAbout PMPC\r\n<\/em><p>\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model. \r\n<em><p>\r\nNote<\/em><br>\r\nTo maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":416032,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Additional

But she and her husband still continue to strive so that they will not be a burden to their children, instead they will help each other in order for them to experience a better life.<P>\r\n\r\nLeonida runs a variety store business that is one of the sources of their income but aside from that, she also sells different homemade sandwich spreads like peanut butter and coco jam (made from coconut). Now she focuses on this business, and that is where she will use the loan that she will receive from Kiva field partner Ahon sa Hirap Inc. (ASHI), buying things that are needed for this business. She will also use the loan in her trading business. This is the selling of different kinds of fish, some of the people in their place call this trading. She is hoping that after buying what is needed for her business, it will give them income for all of their expenses.<P>\r\n\r\nLeonida\u2019s dream is to have a comfortable and strong house for their family.

D. is 26 years old and lives with her husband and their two children, ages 10 and 2. For the past four months she has belonged to the \"Mujeres Latinas\" (\"Latin Women\") Group along with nine other members, all residents of the district of Carabayllo. For the past year Maria has made a living selling tubers in the market called \"Universitaria\" (\"University\"). She practically inherited the sales post from her father and since then she wakes up before dawn everyday and at 3 in the morning she starts to list what she needs to buy at the wholesale market, leaving her children in the care of her husband. With her profits she has started building a second floor on the home given to her by her mother-in-law, and also help out with family expenses like the water and electric bill. Maria tells us this is very tough work but it has its rewards, so she works a lot and in the future she would like to buy a car that she can use for a taxi service. The loan she is requesting will be used to increase her merchandise and thus increase her profits.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2250,"image":{"id":416271,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Buy more merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:49Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gladis","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Magaly Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Shenicka","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Abraham Vladimir","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Cristina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zoila Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Filomena Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gina Gelen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa Petronila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":6500,"loan_amount":2250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2166.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2166.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":2166.66}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":562.5,"local_amount":1625,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T12:46:38Z","rounded_local_amount":1631.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110669088,"comment":null},{"amount":1687.5,"local_amount":4875,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:15:31Z","rounded_local_amount":4893.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118064546,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-11-16T07:54:23Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T11:15:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":148502,"name":"Sergio Antonio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Sergio Antonio A.

She went to work for a company and became a long-time employee.  Unfortunately, she lost her job when her employer went bankrupt.  Around the same time, she acquired a piece of property in Santa Ana Los Olivos so that she could start over.  While moving into her new home, Victoria worried about how she was going to earn a living.  During a visit to a street market near her new home, she thought of starting a business selling condiments (chili peppers, spices, ground seasonings, etc.).\r\n<p>\r\nHer business started off badly.  She gradually gained a few customers, but being an informal street merchant is a risky proposition.  Having to acquire and guard her merchandise created double work for Victoria.  The municipal police would often come by and throw out her merchandise instead of asking her to remove it.  This created headaches for her because she had to deciD. between making a large purchase of inventory or make the sacrifice to save enough money to acquire her own spice stand.  Fortunately, Victory is happy to have her own business in an area that is well-kept and secure.

Por este motivo est\u00e1 solicitando por primera vez a Edpyme Alternativa un cr\u00e9dito de 1000 nuevos soles que piensa invertir en la compra de vitrinas o mostradores. Los cuales har\u00e1n que sus dise\u00f1os tengan mejor vista. Tambi\u00e9n piensa invertir en la compra de material para seguir confeccionando disfraces.\n\nElla es una mujer alegre, din\u00e1mica y trabajadora. Su sue\u00f1o es seguir adelante con su negocio. Enith es optimista y le gusta mucho su trabajo. Cada vez que dise\u00f1a sus disfraces lo hace con la mayor pas\u00edon y entrega posibles.\n","en":"Enith is a 40 year old housewife who has 5 children.  She lives with her husband and her two youngest children, ages 18 and 12, in a relative\u2019s house.  She lives in  the city of  Lambayeque, 15 minutes from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n<p>\r\nShe is engaged in the making of costumes.  She tells us that the idea was born when her children were small and began going to school:  she used to make costumes on her own for her children and the parents of their classmates.  The parents told her that they were very beautiful, and then they began to ask that she make some for their children.  Ever since then she has been working.  Now she is involved in making new costumes on the basis of orders and to rent out those that she keeps.\r\n<p>\r\nDuring the time she has been working, she has invested her profits in the purchase of more material.  As a consequence, her little workshop is crammed with costumes, and she is not able to show them all to her customers.  For this reason, she is applying for the first time to Edpyme Alternativa for a loan of 1000 new soles that she plans to invest in the purchase of counters or display cases.  This will mean that her designs will be more easily seen.   She also plans to invest in material for continuing to make costumes.\r\n<p>\r\nShe is a cheerful, dynamic, and hardworking woman.  Her dream is to get ahead in her business.  Enith is an optimist and likes her work a lot.  Every time she designs a costume she makes it with the greatest passion and delivers the best possible product.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Richard Brown, Kiva

For the past 5 years he has worked as a driver of a leased mototaxi.  (Mototaxis are motorized, 3-wheel vehicles that are licensed for the transportation of passengers).  He used to work as a fare collector on a minibus which operated on the Lambayeque-Chiclayo route.  He had to leave this employment because it did not produce enough income to support his family.  Occasionally he worked as a stevedore in the municipal market.  This income is an important contribution to his family's economic stability.  In addition, his wife works as a domestic employee in a private home.  Together they struggle daily to get ahead and progress.\r\n\r\nThe owner of the vehicle he leases is selling it.  Carlos wants to take advantage of this situation which will afford him a stable income to care for his family.  This is why he is asking Edpyme Alternativa for a 1000 new sol loan to purchase this vehicle and to pay the fees to legalize the ownership transfer and to get the necessary licenses to insure formal work.  His dream is to be able to improve his house which is currently built only in a very unfinished manner and to open a general store which will provide income which will insure his children's higher education.

His original profession is pottery. He makes clay pots and vases at his home at the request of an intermediary who comes and picks up the products eventually. Until a year ago he was also working at an agribusiness, but it had to cut staff and he was fired. With his severance pay he set up a small convenience store in his home thanks to his wife's initiative, and this business assures them of a stable family income. Eventually he also found work as a civil construction worker, but it is not a permanent job like his pottery work. Because of all this he has seen the need to request his first loan of 1,000 soles (approximately $350) through Kiva partner Edpyme Alternative, to use to purchase more merchandise and expand his store. He is an honest father and worker, and his dream is to expand his store and acquire a truck so he can make a living distributing drinks throughout his area since these products are in short supply at local stores.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":416484,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchase supplies to expand his convenience store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Caser\u00edo La Holleria - C.

L\u1ec7 is the leader of a 2-member loan group sponsonred by SEDA. Althoug each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsible for repaying the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is \u0110\u00e0i Bi 2 (1).\r\n\r\n\r\nL\u1ec7 is married and has one young child. To making a living, L\u1ec7 operates a family member's livestock business where she raises and sells pigs. L\u1ec7 has been engaged in this business for over 4 years and earns approximately 2.500.000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2005, L\u1ec7 joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. L\u1ec7 has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4.876.000 VND from SEDA. She used her previous loan to buy piglets to raise and sell in the future. \r\n\r\nShe is now requesting a new loan of 5.886.000 VND that she will use to buy more piglets. This will be L\u1ec7's 6th loan from SEDA. L\u1ec7 plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's living conditions.\r\n\r\nThe other borrower in L\u1ec7's loan group is Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb T. (10117090101), a 42-year-old woman who is requesting a 5.886.000 VND loan to support her livestock business.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout SEDA:\r\n\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to the low income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the Northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n\r\nL\u1ec7 Tr\u1ea7n Th\u1ecb (10117090059) l\u00e0 37 tu\u1ed5i n\u1eef.

Aside from this, Tessie put up a small sari-sari (variety) store in front of their house to earn additional income while waiting for harvest time.

Viviane a besoin de plus de moyens financiers qu'elle en a pour mieux d\u00e9velopper sa boutique. C'est pourquoi, Viviane sollicite un pr\u00eat de ALID\u00e9.

N\u1ee5 has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4.256.000 VND from SEDA. This previous loan was used to purchase additional scrap metal to sell. She is now requesting a new loan of 6.048.000 VND that she will use to purchase additional scrap metal to sell. This will be N\u1ee5's third loan from SEDA.

the highlands of Tangub City, specifically in Purok 7 Silangit, is the residence of Mrs. Elgina M.. She is 37 years of age and is married to Mr. Elizer M.. They have five children who are now in their elementary and high school grades. Her husband is a carpenter with an average income per day of P300 which is just enough for the food needs of their family.\r\n\r\nTo help her husband, Elgina decided to engage in a banana buy and sell business. For two years already, with an initial capital of only P500, she was able to sustain her business and is able to earn an average income of not less than P2,500 a month. This is of great help to her family for their other needs, especially their children\u2019s education.\r\n\r\nAs a new member of the PDP-LP (Paglaum Development Program for Landless People) Program of Paglaum MPC, she was given the privilege of obtaining her second loan of P8,000. She will use this to add to the capital in her existing banana buy and sell business and also for the down payment on a motorcycle to be used in the delivery of her goods.\r\n\r\nThe future income from this loan will be used for their daily needs, for repayment of the loan and for some house improvements.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":416770,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

To sustain her family, she sells cosmetics every day in the city of El Alto and needs this loan to purchase merchandise from Desaguadero because she can acquire it there at a lower price. Like Ver\u00f3nica, the other members of the group also have their own businesses such as selling clothing, potatoes, artifacts, school materials, and fruit. Others make clothing items like jackets, and knit clothing with Alpaca wool. They all need the loan to purchase commodities and raw materials, and continue working on their businesses.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Amy Schapiro, Kiva
