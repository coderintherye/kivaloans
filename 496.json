After the death of her husband, her sons left their education as they had to work to financially support the family. Her elder son sells fish while her younger son paints houses and buildings on contract. \r\n\r\nBashiraan has applied for a loan from Kiva partner Asasah to financially assist her elder son in his business. With the loan, he will buy fish of different kinds to sell. He started this business two years ago and Bashiraan is hopeful that her son will be able to increase his sales by having a good quantity of fish in stock. \r\n\r\nBashiran wants to have him get married because he is 25 years old. She is hopeful that she will be able to do it very soon with the help of increased profits due to the loan. \r\n\r\nShe is a regular loan user of Asasah and this is her 4th loan application. She is a responsible client and always paid her installments on time in previous loan

M. is 28 years old and married. His wife stays at home to take care of household chores while James goes out every day to provide for his family. They have one child aged 3 years old whom they hope to educate to university level. James has been running a studio and selling picture frames to local people for three years. His business is located in Mwingi and he is served by SMEP's Thika branch.

Laxmi and her husband have four grown children, ages 25, 27, 29, and 31.\r\n\r\nIn Nepal, furniture is still made the old-fashioned way. Using little more than basic hand tools, skilled artisans form raw lumber into beautifully finished pieces of furniture. With precision and an eye for detail, furniture makers produce shelves, bed frames, and cabinet sets.  With the help of a Kiva loan, a furniture maker is able to increase the volume of their lumber purchases or hire additional labor. This additional leverage allows an entrepreneur to increase productivity and profitability.\r\n\r\nLaxmi has already received and successfully repaid one loan from Patan BPW and used it to purchase wood and timber for her work.

Today there is a park containing orchids.\r\n\r\nFrancisco started out working in a bakery, but as he wanted to make money on his own and provide a better financial future for his family, he decided to spend his savings buying supplies and open a shop. Nowadays he and his wife start work in the store at 6:30 am. He sells rice, oil, canned goods etc. He also makes bread but not in any great quantity.\r\n\r\nWith the loan he wishes to buy supplies such as canned goods, drinks, and flour to add more variety to his stock.

Hace 10 a\u00f1os que viene trabajando en ese oficio y, ahora ella est\u00e1 planeando comprar un peque\u00f1o terreno agr\u00edcola, con ello podr\u00e1 sembrar sus propios cultivos. Pero sabe que el camino es largo, dentro de muy poco dar\u00e1 el primer paso, comenzar\u00e1 con productos de f\u00e1cil cultivo, para generar capital como es el caso del \u201cpl\u00e1tano\u201d. Micaela es responsable con los pagos a MFP, en cada acuerdo con su banco comunal, estimula a sus integrantes a ser trabajadores y puntuales. Ya es el tercer cr\u00e9dito que obtiene y est\u00e1 contenta por su progreso. Con el cr\u00e9dito que obtendr\u00e1, podr\u00e1 completar el capital que necesita para comprar su propio terreno agr\u00edcola.\n\n","en":"Micaela, age 32, is a tenacious woman.  As a single mother she devotes herself to taking care of her four minor children.  With help from her sister she takes care of them and is bringing them up in a rented house.  This house is in the Kivinaki (central Peruvian jungle) community.\r\n\r\nSince she was a girl, Miacaela has worked in the fields.  Her specialty is growing citrus fruits.  From that time on she has been cultivating and harvesting other people\u2019s productions.  Working as a \u201cpeon\u201d (a hired field worker) does not scare her.  To the contrary, it motivates her to make progress.\r\n\r\nShe has been working this way for ten years.  She is now planning to buy a small piece of farming land, where she will be able to plant some of her own crops.  She knows that this path is long, and shortly she will take the first step.  She will start with crops that are easy to grow, as is the case with bananas, in order to generate capital.\r\n\r\nMicaela is responsible with her payments to MFP.  Each agreement that her communal bank makes motivates the members to be hard-working and punctual.  This is her third loan, and she is happy with her progress.  She will use the loan to have enough money to buy her own farming land.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":641654,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To

She is married to Ronald, 28, and they have a daughter Evelin, who is 7 years old and her reason for living.  They live in Flor's mother's house located in the town of Casacoto.  For the past 6 years she has been earning a living growing potatoes and peas to sell wholesale and retail.  She travels to Lima to sell her harvest because the demand there is higher and she earns a better profit.  During the off season, however, she sells her harvests in the central market in her town.  Some years ago, she decided to try planting potatoes from the coast but the lack of information on how to care for this variety in this climate led to large losses.  She had to sell her truck that served as her transportation.  Now, thanks to the help from her communal bank she has been able to get ahead, and together with Ronald, they are regaining their economic stability.  They now have a truck that her husband uses to transport their merchandise around the country.  This is her third loan with MFP.  She is happy to be working with her communal bank where she gets together with good people who are undertaking great projects from which she will learn a lot.  With the loan that she is requesting she will buy fertilizer to apply to her pea crop that she will harvest in December .  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":641672,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase sacks of fertilizer to apply to her pea crop that is already planted","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-11-17T18:30:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Flor ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-10-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1075}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1075,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:17Z","rounded_local_amount":3004.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227349844,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-11-18T02:43:49Z","paid_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":248725,"name":"Marcia Del Socorro","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Marcia Del Socorro tiene 52 a\u00f1os, su actividad es la venta de comida y transporte.

They are a united family with hope for the future; they live in rural Casacoto.\r\n\r\nShe mentions that the best inheritance she can leave her children is a good education and this is why she works so hard to pay for the college education of her two adolescent sons.  Despite their ages, Juana affirms that they are very responsible and help her care for her crops.  She has been in this business for 15 years now and, as any good farmer, she spends most of the day on her potato and vegetable crops which provide good profits at each harvest because she goes to the central market in the capital to sell at wholesale.\r\n\r\nHowever, during times of scarce production, retailers in her city buy her crops at lower prices.  But, despite the instability in the market, her husband, Erasmo, has a small grocery store that Juana plans to stock so that they will have more profits.\r\n\r\nThis is her 3rd loan with MFP and she is grateful for the support from her fellow communal bank members where she expects much success because they are good and honest.\r\n\r\nShe will use the requested 3000 new soles to buy 80 sacks of manure and if there is money left over to be able to pay salaries to laborers that will help her in the fields.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":641699,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy 80 sacks of manure and pay labor costs for workers to help with the field work.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-11-17T19:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-10-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":725,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:14:14Z","rounded_local_amount":2026.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227349847,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-11-18T09:15:16Z","paid_date":"2011-09-17T08:14:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":248740,"name":"Norma Del Carmen","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Norma Del Carmen tiene 45 a\u00f1os, se dedica a la venta de cosm\u00e9ticos.

She started doing this business 4 years ago and is hopeful that an investment will increase her household income. She is a regular loan user of Asasah and this is her 2nd loan application.

Albina has over 7 hectares (approximately 18 acres) of arable land, where she is constantly planting, particularly after each harvest.\r\n\r\nShe sells her products in her town\u2019s central market, and when seasonal demand is high, she travels to the capital of the country to obtain higher profits.\r\n\r\nBut what she loves most is to witness their children\u2019s achievements. Her eldest son Whitson is pursuing higher studies in the capital, so each month she sends him a considerable sum of money. Later she wants to invest in their other children\u2019s education, as she believes this to be \"the best gift you can offer\".\r\n\r\nAlbina is a very responsible woman, which she demonstrates at each MFP installment. This is her third loan with the community bank, and she is satisfied with the group\u2019s unity and solidarity.

It consists of seven female members who know each other and are neighbors. The members are Bibiana Hern\u00e1ndez Hern\u00e1ndez, who is planning to use her loan to purchase refreshments, tortillas, bread, mayonnaise, peppers, ham, meats, cheese, and other items to make her meals. Florentina Hern\u00e1ndez Hern\u00e1ndez plans to purchase refreshments, candies, bread, ham, corn, vegetables and tortillas to prepare her Mexican cuisine. Marcela M. P. plans to purchase sugar, oil, detergent, soups, refreshments and other items to stock her business. Mar\u00eda F\u00e9lix Mart\u00ednez F. plans to purchase some sheets and bedspreads to fulfill her orders. Gregoria Hern\u00e1ndez G. plans to purchase live pigs to butcher and sell meat by the kilo. Paula D\u00edaz M. plans to purchase fertilizer for her crops. Nora D\u00edaz Mej\u00eda plans to purchase fabrics, thread, zippers, yarn and other items for her seamstress business.<br>\r\nNora is 37 years old and is a high school graduate. She is married and her husband comes from the country. They have three children: Alejandro is 16 years old and is in his third semester of college; Fernanda is 14 years old and is a junior in high school; and Rafael is 6 years old and in primary school. She has a sewing shop and is requesting the loan to purchase sewing supplies, and she also plans to buy a uniform for her son so he can march in the Nov. 20th parade. She started her business 20 years ago when she was 17 years old. She learned the craft from taking sewing courses in her village, and 10 years ago she and her sisters went to the local vocational school to take painting lessons. Now all her sisters also know how to paint. Her husband bought her a sewing machine and little by little she bought some paints and fabrics. She runs her business out of her home in Marcelino Rodr\u00edguez, Axochiapan. Her business is important because it allows her to help a little with household expenses and doesn't put everything on her husband. What she enjoys most about her work is when she finishes a job and it comes out beautiful, and she feels stimulated to keep making her garments. She knows that although she is a woman she can stand on her own, and she feels proud when her children tell her she does beautiful work. Her daughter has always been interested in helping her, and started making handkerchiefs. Now she keeps making them bigger and prettier. Nora's customers are her friends, neighbors, acquaintances and friends of her daughter, for whom she makes dresses for the school dances. Currently she has about 10 customers. It's a small amount because she is helping her mother at her food stand making Mexican cuisine in the mornings and on the weekends during the months of October, November and December, which is the busiest time of year for her mother's business. Nora's business has competition since there are a lot of people who make a living in sewing, but there is always a way to make money. With her profits she plans to buy some paintings, thread, and save some in case there is an emergency and her family needs a doctor or cover school expenses. She is planning to expand her business, taking out some textile painting jobs with Christmas themes as well as offering Christmas-themed cushions, handkerchiefs, curtains and table cloths. Marcelino Rodr\u00edguez is a village that was formed by plantation workers, and their pottery and antiques still remain. Nora's business has helped her family financially and she is able to paint in her spare time. Her biggest desire is to make improvements to her home by building a door opening up to the street and remodeling a room for her sewing and painting shop. Her dreams are to expand her business and have an industrial sewing machine. She wishes to be able to help provide for her children's education so they can become professionals. Nora feels happy and committed to this loan because she plans to stock up on sewing and painting supplies in order to make cushions, handkerchiefs and curtains with pictures of Christmas, Baby Jesus and the Virgin Mary. <br>\r\nThe members of this group want to tell Kiva and Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad that \"we are grateful for the support we are receiving and have confidence we will grow together.\""}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2625,"image":{"id":639116,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchase fabrics, lace, thread, textile paint and other sewing supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"AXOCHIAPAN MOR.","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2010-11-20T04:50:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bibiana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florentina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marcela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Felix","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gregoria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paula ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":32000,"loan_amount":2625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":3200},{"due_date":"2010-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":3200},{"due_date":"2010-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":3200},{"due_date":"2010-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":3200},{"due_date":"2011-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":3200},{"due_date":"2011-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":3200},{"due_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":3200},{"due_date":"2011-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":3200},{"due_date":"2011-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":3200},{"due_date":"2011-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":3200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":262.5,"local_amount":3200,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:16:07Z","rounded_local_amount":3221.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182555011,"comment":null},{"amount":787.5,"local_amount":9600,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:17:39Z","rounded_local_amount":9665.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188691502,"comment":null},{"amount":525,"local_amount":6400,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:44:43Z","rounded_local_amount":6443.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191430686,"comment":null},{"amount":525,"local_amount":6400,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:44:57Z","rounded_local_amount":6443.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195849961,"comment":null},{"amount":525,"local_amount":6400,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:14Z","rounded_local_amount":6443.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201292239,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-11-20T19:48:36Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":248855,"name":"02.08.1.11 Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hoa M.

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Amormia A. is from the village of Ba\u00f1adero, city of Ozamis. She is 35 years old, single and has one school-aged child. Amormia is the group leader of a three-member group loan offered by PMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Amormia A.\u2019s Group.\r\n\r\nTo make a living, Amormia owns and operates a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community. She has been engaged in this business for two years and earns approximately 1,500 PHP a month. \r\n\r\nIn 2010, she joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from PMPC. Amormia is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products for her retail store. This will be the third loan taken out by Amormia from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living condition of her family.\r\n\r\n About PMPC: Paglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model. \r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\nAbout Group Loans\r\n\r\nIn a group loan, each member of the group receives an individual loan but is part of a group of individuals bound by a group guarantee. Under this arrangement, each member of the group supports one another and is responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or default.

In 2000, she established her furniture-making business.  She works 7 days a week and 8 hours a day to support her family.  She has already received and successfully repaid 2 loans from Patan BPW and used her most recent to purchase wood and timber for her work.  In the future, Sanu Maiya plans to improve the economic condition of her family.  She thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\nIn Nepal, furniture is still made the old-fashioned way.  Using little more than basic hand tools, skilled artisans form raw lumber into beautifully finished pieces of furniture.  With precision and an eye for detail, furniture makers produce shelves, bed frames, and cabinet sets.  With the help of a Kiva loan, a furniture maker is able to increase the volume of lumber purchases or hire additional labor.  This additional leverage allows an entrepreneur to increase productivity and profitability. \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.  Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women.  In addition to providing economic opportunity to its clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.

She lives in Punta, Brgy. Hagnaya, San Remgio, Cebu. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2006 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. \r\n\r\nBy working hard in her general store and meat vending businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 5000. Luzviminda is now borrowing PHP 29,500 so that she can purchase more stock to sell. This will be her 6th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 14,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom. \r\n\r\nLuzviminda aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way.\r\n\r\n About NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She earns her living by operating a fishing business.  Her husband Randolf G., who is 40 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have five children who are between 3 and 20 years old. \r\n\r\nMarilou joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past eight loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Marilou has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 14,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of approximately $250, raising the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 9th cycle loan, she is borrowing 12,000 PHP, which she intends to use to pay for more fishing gear so that she can continue to save up for the future and for the education of her children. Marilou G. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She lives in Tagumapay, Barangay Agujo, Daanbantayan, Cebu. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2009 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard at her businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of approximately $117. \r\n\r\nMilagros is now borrowing 15,000 PHP so that she can continue to fund operations. This will be her 3rd loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 7,000 PHP, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. She hopes to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She earns her living by operating a fishing business. Her husband Emelio R., who is 37 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have ten children who are between 8 and 30 years old. \r\n\r\nMilagros joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2009 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past two loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, she has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 5,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of approximately $100, raising the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 3rd cycle loan, she is borrowing 10,000 PHP, which she intends to use to pay for the purchase of pump boat materials so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Milagros R. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned their respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work. \r\n\r\nHelp NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by clicking  the link to the   NWTF Kiva lending team  on Kiva.org to join our team.

She lives in Sitio Mahayahay, Barangay Daan Lungsod, Medellin, Cebu. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2005 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard at her businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of approximately $300. \r\n\r\nVioleta is borrowing 16,000 PHP so that she can purchase fishing gear and equipment. This will be her 9th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 17,000 PHP, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Violeta hopes to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned their respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work. \r\n\r\nHelp NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by clicking  the link to the   NWTF Kiva lending team  on Kiva.org to join our team.

She earns her living by operating a videoke bar business. Her husband Emiliano C., who is 38 years old, works as a carpenter to earn his living. They have four children who are between 7 and 15 years old and are currently going to school. \r\n\r\nFidela joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she wanted something better for her family. With the help of her past six loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Fidela has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 11,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of approximately $100, raising the family's standard of living. \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 7th loan, she is borrowing 11,000 PHP, which she intends to use to pay for more supplies for her business so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children.

She earns her living by operating two business ventures: a sari-sari (general) store and a candy-making business. Her husband Agapito M., who is 38 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living. They have four children who are between 3 and 14 years old, and all of them are currently going to school. \r\n\r\nMercy joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she hoped for something better for her family. With the help of her past five loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Mercy has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 8,500 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of approximately $150, raising the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 6th loan, she is borrowing 10,000 PHP, which she intends to use to purchase more stock for her store so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children.

He has been doing this business for the past 8 years and is the only breadwinner in the family. \r\n\r\nRasheeda herself is a housewife, stays at home and does her household works.  She has applied for a loan from Kiva partner Asasah for her husband\u2019s business. With the loan, he will buy hair oil in large quantity for reselling.

She earns her living by operating 3 business ventures: a general store, selling frozen foods and a RTW dealer (Natasha, Avon) businesses. She has 5 children and all have families of their own. \r\n\r\nHedda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 13 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Hedda has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 14th loan, she is borrowing PHP 25000, which she intends to use to purchase more stocks to sell so that she could continue to save up for the future. Hedda L. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

Currently, his farm has three cows, twenty sheep, three bull calves and three horses.\r\n \r\nAkylbek plans to use this loan of 60000 KGS to increase the number of cattle for fattening and reselling. With the revenues, he plans to finance his son's wedding and give a good education to the younger children.\r\n  \r\nIn the future, Akylbek plans to develop a big farm that he can pass on to his children and future grandchildren.\r\n \r\nBai-Tushum and Partners is one of the leading microfinance Institutions in Kyrgyzstan.

With the help of her past eight loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Helen has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 5000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her ninth loan, she is borrowing PHP 19500, which she intends to use to purchase a pump boat, an outrigger canoe powered by a small engine. She will use the profit from the loan for the future maintenance of her pump boat for fishing. \r\n\r\nHelen L. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\"). NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon, a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

They have two children who are 8 and 10 years old. \r\n\r\nLerma joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 5 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Lerma has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 17,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 6th loan, she is borrowing PHP 19,500, which she intends to use to fund her business operations so that she can continue to save up for the future to sustain their daily needs and to educate their children. Lerma V. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

This will be her 16th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 19500, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Lorena aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

Rizalina has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Rizalina joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Rizalina has successfully repaid a previous loan of 15,000 PHP from GDMPC. Rizalina is requesting a new loan of 25,000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the 26th loan taken out by Rizalina from GDMPC.

Her 3 elder sons work in the factories while the others stay at home and help her in managing the grocery store business.\r\n\r\nJinna has applied for a loan from KIVA partner Asasah for her sweater knitting business.

She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures: a general store and vegetable vending. Her husband, Jessie T., who is 59 years old, works as a driver to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have 5 children who are between 15 to 31 years old.\r\n\r\nNorma joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1996 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 17 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Norma has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 29,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 18th loan, she is borrowing PHP 29,500, which she intends to use as additional working capital so that she can continue to save up for future family needs. Norma T. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Artem has been engaged in his business for over 5 years and earns approximately 12,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Artem joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Artem is requesting a new loan of 40,000 PHP, which will be used to repair the transport vehicle used in the business. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Artem from GDMPC. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of his family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

M. K. is thirty-five years old, married, and has five children aged between fourteen and two years old. Her business is located at Mariakani estate in Mombasa, Kenya. Mombasa is in the coastal region of Kenya and is well known for its many many tourist attraction sites, not forgetting the Indian ocean white beaches.\r\n\r\nShe provides tailoring services to the local people. She also makes clothes and displays them for sale to her customers. She has been in this business for fifteen years now and has three employees. She says that this business is profitable and the major challenge she has is tied-up capital since some customers order clothes to be made and then refuse to pick up the clothes, and so she has to put them on display for other people to buy them later.

That is not true for Kyrgyzstan. The most necessary food supplies like meat, fruits, and milk products are a luxury for a typical rural family. The government regulations fail to efficiently allocate locally-made products, while most of it goes for cheap export. Local citizens purchase goods at quite a high price.\r\n\r\nBurulcha N., 53, is a leader of this group. She is a junior nurse in a sanitary-epidemic hospital in the small town of Toktogul. She is a widow and has four grown children. She worked hard her entire career in a hospital but still could not provide a good life with the salary of a social worker. She did a tremendous job in satisfying all the needs of her children, and now it is her children\u2019s turn to bring some fresh air into their mother\u2019s life. \r\n\r\nBurulcha\u2019s youngest son spent his salary to purchase cattle. Together, they managed to gradually increase the number of cattle. The biggest challenge for this family is to find capital for conducting business, because the input prices rise every year and sometimes it gets hard to cover production costs. Burulcha has organized a group of people, each of whom has unique financial hardships. Burulcha is asking for a loan of 10,000 soms so that she can buy additional cattle and make general repairs on her house. \r\n\r\n --- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused microfinance institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

Such clothing designers as Dilbar Ashimbaeva, Assol Moldokmatova and Galina Boikova are proving that Kyrgyz ornaments and traditional accessories can arouse a great deal of interest on an international scale.<p>\r\n\r\nGulvarkhon J., the 48-year-old leader of this group, is a resident of  Uzgen and the mother of eight daughters, three of whom are under 18.  Her   husband is a cab driver.  \r\n\r\nA unique designer and sewer, Gulvarkhon's creation is a \u201ctushak\u201d, which is a mattress or a blanket that is usually spread on the floor with pillows on it. It\u2019s a great symbol of Kyrgyz handmade traditional goods, and almost every family has some at home, which explains the big demand for them. Gulvarkhon used to make tushaks just for home use or as gifts to friends, but one day her friend suggested that it could be a good business idea. And she was right. The popularity of these tushaks has spurred great interest among both local residents and foreigners. <p>\r\n\r\nSewing these tushaks requires large expenditures on inputs such as fabrics of cotton, velvet and velor. Gulvarkon believes that her group is suitable for this loan and she thanks all lenders. Gulvarkhon\u2019s dream is to purchase a two-storied house.<p>\r\n\r\n --- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

Gulya and her husband always loved children and dreamed about having a big friendly family. Fortunately, they were blessed to become parents of three wonderful boys and a girl.

The father of the family works as a driver in a local construction firm \u201cKurulush\u201d, but he realized that unfortunately, his salary is not enough to provide his children with a good college education. So Gulya decided to make her own contribution in a family budget. For her husband\u2019s monthly salary, she purchased two cattle. Soon she managed to gain profit for buying an additional one. At this moment, she runs her business successfully and would like to get a loan to purchase one more cattle. With proceeds of business, she plans to buy a bigger amount of cattle and to purchase a piece of land for constructing a house of her dream.

It\u2019s amazing how people from different parts of the planet care about the lives of people they haven\u2019t even met. The basic foundation of a project like Kiva is the hearts of those people \u2013 who are not indifferent and can help in a challenging situation in life.\r\n<br>Katcha M., 53, is the leader of this group. She lives in the small town of Uzgen, in the south of Kyrgyzstan. The majority of the town's population is engaged in farming. The most popular and unique crop here is a certain type of brown rice. \r\n<br>Katcha confesses that the greatest accomplishment in her life was bringing up seven noble children. Her oldest child is 33 years old and the youngest is 16. For this family, farming has been the only source of income for the last 27 years. Their business story started when Katcha bought a cow with a calf for 6,500 KGS. Every member did what they could to push forward dairy production. At first, the dairy assortment was very narrow, but now the diversification of products is impressive. The family supplies milk, butter and sour cream. \r\n<br>Katcha is excited to be taking her first loan with Kiva partner, Mol Bulak, after realizing how many great opportunities this loan will give her. She can\u2019t wait until she gets this loan to expand her business, enabling her to be a better provider for her family. Milk products have a great quality and are in high demand. With the proceeds from her loan, Katcha will organize a long-awaited wedding ceremony for her son.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Where did this loan come from?<\/b><br>\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan. Mol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of the 3-Ps concept: People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and society as well), Profit (to be profitable in order to grow further), and the Planet (taking care of the environment). It is also the only MFI in Kyrgyzstan that delivers its services to customers 365 days a year.

Some people treat it with respect as a sign of wisdom and greatness. Some fear it, and try to face it as late as possible. And some just accept it as inevitable human nature and deal with it easily. Our next heroine thinks that aging is not an excuse for not following dreams and being successful.\r\n \r\nMarjan D., 63, born in the small town of Toktogul, started her business breeding livestock 25 years ago. Growing up in the village, this was the only thing she spent her whole time on and was good at. The art of taking good care of livestock is carefully taught from one generation to the next. Marjan is married and is fortunate to have five children. Her husband has worked as a surgeon his entire life. The children are already grown and have their own families. Marjan used only 15,000 KGS for her business start-up and had to sacrifice her husband\u2019s salary. She and her husband understood that it was very risky to invest the last savings in business start-up, but an endless hope and belief drove them forward. Despite her age, Marjan is a very ambitious woman. She gathered a group of four businessmen who are very experienced in breeding livestock before she applied for a loan. At this time Marjan needs 20,000 KGS, which she will use to purchase one more head of cattle. Her dream is to purchase land in the capital Bishkek.\r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused microfinance institution in Kyrgyzstan.

If a foreigner goes to local bazaars, he would think that only women live in this region. The very few things they can do are retail, farming, stock-breeding and nursing. Considering past mistakes, many families try to give their children a good education. \r\n\r\nOrozbu K., 50, is the leader of this group. She is a resident of a small town, Uzgen. She\u2019s a single mother of two sons in their twenties. Just like thousands of young guys throughout the country, her second son, finding no job opportunities in Kyrgyzstan, decided to leave for Russia and make his living there. Her oldest son is a cab driver, and drives for almost twelve hours a day on a major route of the country, which connects the only two developed cities. \r\n\r\nBoth of Orozbu\u2019s sons invest a part of their savings in a family business, which was started in 1998. Her main occupation has been retailing food supplies, including rice, sugar, and pasta. In summertime she switches to the sale of watermelons, which have a huge supply in summer, especially in southern Kyrgyzstan. Orozbu is excited to get this loan of 10,000 soms, money that will be spent on circulation of commodities. Orozbu and her group are very thankful to all lenders and believe they will repay the loan successfully. \r\n\r\n --- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).
