It was a key post along the Silk Road and prominent at the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History:\r\n<br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\t\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous, and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment, forcing hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use their equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

Umar is 44 years old and is married with three children. Umar has been involved in the sale of spare parts for bicycles since 2004. Gradually the business expanded. Being hard-working and polite by nature, he has managed to obtain a clientele that is happy with the goods and the service. The income he derives allows him to provide for the family needs as he is the only bread-winner in the family.\r\n<p>\r\nToday Umar requests $800 for the term of 9 months.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after Tajikistan\u2019s independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

Gulbahor is the happy mother of three children. She is 37 years old and married. Gulbahor is a teacher. Her salary is very little, which is why she has been running her own grocery business. For two years, she has been selling foodstuffs in her grocery store. Gulbahor\u2019s wish is to increase her business by offering a variety of food items to the customers who pass through this market. She works with one aim in mind: to provide the best possible example and way of life for her beloved children who are all the apple of her eye and the reason for her daily efforts. With this opportunity, along with the immense love she feels as a mother and her desire to succeed, she is appealing to your generosity and is requesting a loan of $800 in order to increase the range of her goods. She promises to repay the loan within nine months.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Batick pieces are traditional African clothing which is mostly worn by women. They look good when they are painted with dye and many people like them. Ruth works at the business for 9-12 hours per day, 6 days per week. Ruth currently earns about US$318 from her business. She is requesting a loan in order to purchase cloth and dye for making batik.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.

She lives in a large, polygamous family with her husband, her husband\u2019s three other wives, their children and many other families in a shared home. This is a typical arrangement for traditional families in S\u00e9gou Sokalakono, the 2nd district in the city of S\u00e9gou, which is located in the 4th administrative region in the Republic of Mali. \r\nAlthough Mrs. D. trained as a secretary, she began working in commercial business after her training. She has had many occupations including the sale of teacups, grains and fabric. Mrs. D. opted for the sale of soap. For five years she has been selling liquid soap from her home and by travelling to different locations within S\u00e9gou.  Mrs. D. enjoys a good reputation due to her work for the Artisan Bureau, training others in the processing of local products. She also teaches children who are not able to attend school. To make liquid soap she requires 1kg of soap paste, 1 kg of iodized salt and 12 litres of water. These ingredients get mixed together for two days. On the second day, salt, colouring and perfume are added. \r\nIn order to increase her business capital and meet the demand of her clientele, Mrs. D. has been working with Soro Yiriwaso for 36 months. After 4 group loans and 1 individual loan, all which were repaid in full, she is requesting her second individual loan in the amount of 400,000 FCFA which she plans to use for the purchase of 1 barrel of soap paste and 1000 empty bottles to use as packaging.  She gets her supplies from the large market in Bamako, the capital of Mali. \r\nMrs. D. makes sales by cash or credit.  She hopes to earn a profit of 60,000 FCFA which she will use to pay the interest on her loan, to participate in social events such as celebrations and funerals and to pay her maid. \r\nHer goal is to develop a permanent site for her business which can also serve as a training classroom. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Allana Carlyle, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":304764,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":"The purchase of soap paste and empty bottles for packaging","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Segou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14 -6","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":825,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Molobaly  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":400000,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2010-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2010-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":102224,"name":"Pham Thi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tr\u00ed Ph\u1ea1m (630071669) is a 52 year-old female living in the town of H\u01b0ng Nguyen.

She lives in a monogamous family with her husband and children in the Bagadadji district of the city of S\u00e9gou (fourth administrative region of the Republic of Mali).  For societal reasons, she dropped out of school to get married.  Since being a student, she worked in commerce with her mother, who used to sell honey.  After several years at her mother\u2019s side, she acquired solid experience, which enabled her to fly on wings of her own.  \r\n<p>\r\nImproving by herself and working at many kinds of jobs, such as selling fish, meat kebabs, and <i>galettes<\/i>, she decided in the end to become specialized in the clothing business.  She has been in this business for 22 years and enjoys a large customer base and fame at the S\u00e9bougou marketplace and in the district where she lives, there where customers come to buy at her house.  Her clothing is of good quality and popular.  \r\n<p>\r\nTo increase her working capital, Sitan has turned to the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso, with which she has been associated for 48 months.  After four solidarity loans and two individual loans, all repaid, she is now on her third individual loan.\r\n<p>\r\nShe plans to use this loan to buy twelve outfits of rich damask fabric of different colors from dye experts in Bamako, the capital of Mali.  She makes her sales to customers composed of men and women, cash or credit accepted.  \r\n<p>\r\nShe hopes to realize a monthly profit of 35,000 francs CFA that will enable her to pay the <i>tontines<\/i> (community revolving savings and loan groups), to participate in societal events, and to cover certain family expenses.

She is married and has five kids who attend primary school. Alice lives with her husband and children in a community called Oda, in eastern Ghana. Many people here are engaged in farming. However, some of the women, including Alice, are involved in the production of palm oil. She has been in this business for two years. Her husband is a farmer.\r\n\r\nShe buys the palm nuts from local farmers in her community; processes it in her house to produce the oil, and sells at wholesale prices to her customers. Palm oil is a local vegetable oil produced from palm fruit that is cooked, pounded, sieved, and boiled for hours. The reddish oil is skimmed off and reboiled to expel water content.

Catalina plans to use the money she is requesting at this time to purchase fertilizer for her crops. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Christopher Knutson, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":304954,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchasing fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-04-19T02:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Catalina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":650,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:29Z","rounded_local_amount":2018.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118123952,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-04-19T05:20:44Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":102290,"name":"Comunidad Unida - 9 Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This group of five entrepreneurs is taking its first loan with Esperanza International, Kiva's partner.

They have 2 children together.  A few months ago, they lived in his inlaws' house, but now he is very happy to have moved to their own house.  Since he was very young, he has liked working in agriculture.  When his father prepared the oxen to plow his land, he got very excited because his job was to break in the bulls to plow each one of the plots of land.  Now he is a very responsible man, and he grows his crops with a lot of care.  In previous years, he mainly grew potatoes, but because they weren't very profitable, he lessened the quantity that he grew of them and now grows more peas because they are more profitable.  Also, when he has time, he helps his neighbors with their crops, and they pay him 18 to 20 PEN every day.  With this money, he can cover the cost of his family's food and he can put the money from his harvests towards the next season's planting.  Juli\u00e1n's dream is to improve his economic situation and to furnish his home with the basic necessary items.

Linda is a very active and hard-working woman; her parents brought her up doing farm work, but since she\u2019s been married her husband has worked on the farm while she makes a living attending to her grocery store, which she has had for about 15 years.  She also provides lunches for some of the teachers at the local primary school and high school.  Lucinda rises at 4:00 AM so that her breakfasts will be ready at 7:00 AM, after which she feeds the pigs she is raising\u2014all the while attending to her grocery store\u2014and at 11:00 AM she has everything ready for her customers.  Her business of selling pigs is very profitable, since she feeds the pigs with what\u2019s left of the potato crop, and when they reach the necessary weight she slaughters them and sells the meat at markets.  However, the store is her main focus, and it gives her much satisfaction because she gets daily profits and is able to chat pleasantly with each of her customers.  Lucinda\u2019s husband is one of the founders of their communal bank, and she joined as a member due to her husband\u2019s absence.

As such, the first thing the family did was to register as commoners with joint tenure of the land so that they could continue cultivating it, whether irrigated or temporary. The whole time, Macario has been planting potatoes and peas, and at the same time rearing animals. Two years ago he put a grocery shop into his house so that his wife could run it. All of these businesses give him great joy and satisfaction so, despite the difficulties of pests threatening his crops, he remains highly motivated and dedicated, sowing his seeds with much care. For many years his crops have provided comfort and wellbeing for his family. Macario is the president of his community bank, where he promotes diplomacy during the various dilemmas amongst the members. This is his 7th loan with MFP and he is an example of punctual repayments. The money that he is asking for now is to buy insecticides to control the pests on his potato and broad bean crops.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lara Francis, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":304967,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy insecticides","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-04-19T11:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Macario","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":650,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:28Z","rounded_local_amount":2018.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118123955,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-04-19T13:53:17Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":102305,"name":"Sabino","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Sabino tiene 38 a\u00f1os de edad, es casado y tiene dos hijos que viven en su casa.

Before starting his agricultural labours he first observes the development of his plants, where he removes any bad ones that could threaten the rest, thereby trying to prevent the spread of pests in advance. His cultivation process is first to plant potatoes with an application of fertilizer, then he harvests them, and follows this by sowing peas. In this way he is able to avoid having to use fertilizer so the planting of peas results in a small investment. And market prices are generally stable, without affecting his capital investment. In this way, he tries to reap all of the benefits from each one of his farms with these two products. His greatest difficulty is that he does not own the land himself. Sabino participates in all the payment meetings. He is the funny man and his peers enjoy his jokes.

Agricultural work is part of his life.  He is a noble and charismatic man, but above all he is very devoted to his farming.  When we visited him, we found him harvesting potatoes at seven in the morning and smiling with the joy that this chore brings him.   Afterward, he gets his produce ready and transports it to be sold in the city markets.  Growing potatoes is very profitable for Alberto.  Although it's a lot of work to produce them, he feels very satisfied with the prices at market.  This motivates him to continue planting them, in order to improve the quality of life for his young children.  Alberto plans to increase his plantings but he doesn't have his own fields.  This doesn't discourage him.  He will continue farming on rented farmland until he is able to buy his own.  His wife usually attends the meetings of his communal bank because he is working in his fields.  This is his seventh loan with Microfinanzas PRISMA and in all of that time he has shown himself to be a very punctual client.

S. is 59 years old and lives in Asentamiento Humano Aurora D\u00edaz, in the district of Salaverry, in the province of Trujillo, in the region of La Libertad, Peru.  She studied up until her second year of primary school, after which she had to begin working because her parents could no longer pay for her education. She has 5 children but only 1 of them is still dependent on her. She is also a member of the local mothers' club.\r\n\r\nSantos sells meals, soft drinks and beer. She began this business 26 years ago, operating out of a small shop, but had to leave it when she became ill. When she returned to work once more, she first tried selling fuel but she eventually returned to selling meals, soft drinks and beer. Her business went very well and with her profits she bought, and then later resold, two different stalls. The business continues to turn a healthy profit and today she works out of her own home. \r\n\r\nSantos' first loan from the Las Auroras en Acci\u00f3n II Communal Bank was of 300 soles and with it she bought the ingredients and utensils she needed to make and sell her meals. With this loan of 1,000 soles, which she will pay back in 6 months, she will buy beer and soft drinks in order to increase her working capital. Santos dreams of having a bar and restaurant in her home. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Sara Sultan, Kiva

Her primary customers are residents of the community, neighbors, and friends.  \n\nWith this loan of 2,000 PEN, which she will repay in 6 months, she will buy more products to stock her store like rice, sacks of sugar, eggs, items for personal hygiene, house cleaning products, packages of soft drinks, sweets, and other products to keep her customers happy.  She feels very happy about the work and service that she gives.  \n\nShe is grateful to Manuela Ramos for supporting people like her who want to work and get ahead.

He is married and already has 5 children.  His wife does not have a job.  She stays at home and takes care of the house, raises the children and feeds the livestock when she is able.  Yusufjon fattens and sells livestock.  The start of spring is the season for purchasing livestock for Yusufjon, because it is currently cheap.

Since last year his livestock headcount has increased.  His wife is a homemaker.  In February Mirsharif bought a dairy cow for his wife.  His wife was very happy about this, because the milk that she got from the cow was enough for the family and she was also able to sell some of it.  But one cow does not produce that much milk to earn good profits.  She asked her husband to buy her another dairy cow.

She will use the loan to purchase different merchandise like soft drinks and biscuits (cookies) that are very much in demand during harvest season.

Mavluda has very good taste and she is ready to advise her clients about which textile to choose for this or that occasion. That is why she has steady customers. Moreover, Mavluda\u2019s prices for fabric are attractive for various levels of the population as she has a wide range of goods for any taste and any wallet. The income that she derives allows her to educate her children on a high level. She hopes that she can continue to provide for them so they will be able to receive an adequate education. Now Mavluda needs $800 USD to purchase new types of fabric in order to increase the range of goods she sells.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Rahima is 42 years old. She is married and has a son. She owns a specialized fabrics store at the central market in the town of Penjikent. Rahima works in a sphere of trade where the demand is always very consistent and high, because the national dresses of Tajikistan are very popular and a very important item of the dowry of any girl. She is one of the leading fabrics vendors in the market where she works. She is very persistent and determined in all of her business endeavors, which has helped to sustain her venture for 10 years. \r\n<p>\r\nRahima is a skilled entrepreneur. When she started this trade, she implemented the basic concepts of integrity and hard work in her business in order to attain ultimate success. This laid a firm foundation for winning results and Rahima has obviously been a successful small entrepreneur. \r\n<p>\r\nHowever, she doesn\u2019t want to stop. She would like to continue to see her venture grow. Today she is requesting a loan of $800 for 12 months to increase her assorted inventory. With your help, Rahima will be able to make her business succeed and support her son's education.  \r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

Oisara is 38 years old. She is married and the loving mother of four children. She is a hard-working woman struggling to feed her children by selling traditional fabrics for national dresses.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

He is married and the father of four children.  Zafarjon has a herd of small-horned cattle, consisting of approximately 30 sheep and 10 goats.  His wife is a housewife, but in her spare time spins the wool into yarn and knits a variety of warm items of clothing.  She sells these things to neighbors and relatives.  Each morning Zafarjon drives the cattle into the hills, where they graze, and in the evening drives them back home.  Although he does not yet have any large-horned cattle, with this loan Zafarjon wants to purchase two medium-sized bulls.  After fattening them for three to four months, he can sell them for a very good price.

Urozdavlat is 21 years old. He is not married and lives with his parents. Urozdavlat is a noble worker dedicated to raising animals, primarily sheep, which he buys and sells in the commercial city markets. This work is very agreeable to him, because raising animals is what he enjoys most. \r\n<p>\r\nUrozdavlat requires a certain amount of money to increase the number of his sheep. By increasing his product he hopes to increase his household income, as well to stay solvent in terms of his ability to continue buying and selling animals.   \r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

Dilorom is 34 years old. She is married and the loving mother of four children.\r\n<p>\r\nDilorom is a market vendor. For the last four years she has been selling cottonseed oil at the local market. In the traditional Tajik cuisine the majority of the meals are fried or cooked using cottonseed oil - especially our national dish \u201cPilaw\u201d, which needs much cottonseed oil in order it to be delicious. So the goods that Dilorom is selling are in strong demand among the population.\r\n<p>\r\nToday, Dilorom is planning to increase her business. For this reason she requests $800 for the term of 9 months. Dilorom is counting on your help and thanks you for your support.\r\n<p><br>\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and for it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after Tajikistan\u2019s independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Her son keeps them supplied, while her daughter helps to sell fruit and vegetables.  Her stall is located at an optimum place at the center of the market.  Saodat has collaborated with MicroInvest since 2007.  Her fruit is in great demand as vitamin deficiencies are common and everyone buys from her.

Mamadali, 68 years old, is married with three children. Mamadali sells dried fruits in the central local market. He has been in this business for 11 years. \r\n<p>\r\nDried fruits are very popular in Tajikistan: any hostess will have dried fruits on hand for serving in case there are guests in the house. Moreover, dried fruits are served as a rule during all family occasions, such as wedding parties, birthday parties, and other events. \r\n<p>\r\nConsidering the constant demand for his goods, Mamadali's business is quite successful and brings in a stable income for the family. Now Mamadali wants to increase the stock of his goods in order to be able to supply all the demands of his buyers. For this purpose, he requests $800 for the term of 9 months. He is going to use the loan to purchase dried fruits, like raisins and apricots, as well as nuts, like almonds and pistachios, with the purpose of increasing his range of goods for sale. \r\n<p>\r\nMamadali has already demonstrated himself to be a dependable client with positive credit history. He would like to thank all for their support and promises to pay the loan in time.   \r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after Tajikistan\u2019s independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

The second cow will enable him increase milk production and will provide income security to the family whenever one of the cows is in calf.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Since salaries are usually small in Sierra Leone, especially so for people in the teaching profession, teachers could not use such salaries to buy or do anything important. But with a loan they can now buy or do something big and then repay the loan over a period of time. Some of them will use the loan to begin or to continue building a house; others to pay either for themselves to pursue further studies or to pay for their children\u2019s education. Some will use it to invest in businesses in order to complement their monthly salaries. And still others will use theirs to buy pieces of furniture.\r\n<p>\r\nMrs. Winston Ashcroff (third from right) is the head teacher of R.E.C Primary School. She was born in Hastings, twenty miles (thirty-two km) from Freetown, the capital city of Sierra Leone. She is age fifty-four, a widow with two children. One of her children is in Senior Secondary School III (SSS III) and the other in SSS II. She has been a teacher for thirty-three years now. Mrs. Winston will use this loan to pay her children\u2019s school

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They range in age from 30 to 55 years of age and are mothers averaging four children each.  The women live in traditional extended families in the Massablacoura district in Bougouni (third administrative region of the Republic of Mali).  They are united by community ties, and they do commerce in various goods having to do with grains and clothing. \r\n<p>\r\nThese women have been partners of Soro Yiriwaso for two years and are on their third solidarity loan.  The preceding loans have been correctly repaid. \r\n<p>\r\nThe group members are going to use this loan to buy five sacks of peanuts and four sacks of rice from rural producers in villages surrounding Bougouni.  The grain is then hulled and sold retail at the Bougouni marketplace.  The customers are composed particularly of housewives.  The clothing retailers are buying twenty men's suits in Burkina Faso to sell in Bougouni generally to men. \r\n<p>\r\nThis business is profitable because it enables each group member to earn an average of 30,000 francs CFA a month.  This profit margin allows for the making of loan payments and for addressing family expenses, notably those associated with the children's health, education, and clothing.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":305343,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy clothing and grain ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Bougouni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.416667 -7.483333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yesso","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maratou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aichata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":300000,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":102494,"name":"Loveth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Loveth I. sells bottled water, canned drinks and juice.

They range in age from 35 to 47 and are mothers averaging two children each on average.  They live in traditional extended families in the Massablacoura district of the city of Bougouni (third administrative region of the Republic of Mali).  They are united by community ties, and they essentially do commerce in grains (<i>fonio<\/i>, rice, millet, etc.)\r\n<p>\r\nThese women have been partners of Soro Yiriwaso for two years and are on their fifth solidarity loan.  The preceding loans were correctly repaid.  The women of Benkadi are going to use this loan to buy 100 kg of millet, 50 kg of <i>fonio<\/i>, and 150 kg of rice from rural producers of the villages surrounding Bougouni.  The grain is sold retail at the Bougouni marketplace.  The customers are composed especially of housewives. \r\n<p>\r\nThis business is profitable because it enables each group member to earn an average of 40,000 francs CFA per month.  This profit margin allows for the making of loan payments and for addressing family expenses, notably those associated with the children's health, education, and clothing.\r\n<br

","en":"Chantal, age 34 and unmarried, is the mother of one 12-year-old girl who attends school. She sells fruits, peanuts, as well as soft drinks. She was introduced to this business by her mother in 1985 and, over the years, she has acquired a strong experience in sales and management. In 1992, her starting capital amounted to $20, which enabled her to buy one sack of peanuts, which she started reselling. From 1992 to 2001, thanks to her diligent work and good management, Chantal managed to increase her capital to $300, in spite of the encountered difficulties, such as the pillages of 1993 and the political and economical instability in her city.

Her two older children go to school. She owns a five-room house where she lives with her family, and also takes care of additional family members--her mother and her late brother's two children. Samalie has access to electricity and piped water at home, and the family gets three meals a day. \r\n\r\nAnother member of Samalie's loan group, Leticia, makes a living running a retail shop in a nearby suburb.

She has been in business for such a long time thanks to the fine quality of her work. It could sometimes take her up to a whole month to finish embroidering, depending on how complicated the designs are. Rosalina makes clothing for her community\u2019s traditional festivities in which women wear skirts and shawls with bright and colorful embroidery. For Rosalina, this line of work is a form of entertainment. It has allowed her to care for her children, who are now mostly all adults and are very grateful to their mother for always protecting them and providing them with an education. In the future, Rosalina would like to stay in the embroidery business because it does not require great physical exertion. This is the second time she requests a loan from MFP, and she is committed to work for her microfinance institute\u2019s well-being. The money that she is requesting will be used to purchase fabric and thread in various colors, materials that are indispensable for producing handmade embroidery. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Elizabeth Casian, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":305429,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","use":"Purchase materials for embroidering","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-04-20T21:30:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":825,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosalina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":163},{"due_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":166.76},{"due_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":177.84},{"due_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":185.85},{"due_date":"2009-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":191.44},{"due_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":200.35},{"due_date":"2009-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":211.83},{"due_date":"2009-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":219.53},{"due_date":"2009-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":231.24},{"due_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":239.35},{"due_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":252.43},{"due_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":260.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.79},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.03},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.69},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.18},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.12},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.9},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.44},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.31},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.99},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.3},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":53.79,"local_amount":163,"processed_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:50:20Z","rounded_local_amount":167.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012456,"comment":null},{"amount":55.03,"local_amount":166.76,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:01:54Z","rounded_local_amount":170.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44596046,"comment":null},{"amount":58.69,"local_amount":177.84,"processed_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:43:54Z","rounded_local_amount":182.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990310,"comment":null},{"amount":61.33,"local_amount":185.85,"processed_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:45:23Z","rounded_local_amount":190.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211433,"comment":null},{"amount":63.18,"local_amount":191.44,"processed_date":"2009-08-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:27:43Z","rounded_local_amount":196.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640944,"comment":null},{"amount":66.12,"local_amount":200.35,"processed_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:40:11Z","rounded_local_amount":205.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080412,"comment":null},{"amount":69.9,"local_amount":211.83,"processed_date":"2009-10-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:15:41Z","rounded_local_amount":217.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996591,"comment":null},{"amount":72.44,"local_amount":219.53,"processed_date":"2009-11-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:00Z","rounded_local_amount":224.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842109,"comment":null},{"amount":324.52,"local_amount":983.4,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:06:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1007.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110733785,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

She works every day at her principal source of income, which is a vulcanizing business.  She offers the services of repairing automobile tires, and filling the tires on her clients' cars with her air compressor.  She carries out this work together with her husband, who is an important part of the business.  They both work hard to improve the quality of their services, and because of their hard work, their customers progressively increase in number.  Among their clientele, the majority are drivers of public transportation vehicles.  Sonia and her husband strategically located their business by the bus stop where the majority of bus lines complete their route, so as to provide the drivers with easy access to their services.

She lives in the El Porvenir settlement, Bellavista District, San Martin Department.  She is single, 42 years old, and the mother of 4 children, one of whom still depends on her economically.  Motivated by her enterprising spirit, with her initial loan of 300 soles, she began her own business preparing and selling meals and soft drinks daily providing food for her customers with her customary charisma and good service.  Currently, she continues with this enterprise which she undertakes from her own home.  She is happy with her work and has been working with the communal bank for two years.  With this 2000 sol loan, which she will repay in 6 months, she intends to purchase various brands of soft drinks in a variety of flavors and sizes as well as raw materials in bulk, such as rice, sugar, vegetables, live poultry, etc. for the preparation of her meals.  A portion of the funds will be used to buy tables, chairs and accessories to offer still better service.  She is very happy that she was able to raise her children alone and, thanks to Manuela Ramos who helped her quite a bit, she now has a business in which she herself manages all decisions regarding income and expenses.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":303337,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase raw materials for meal preparation.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"San Mart\u00edn - San Mart\u00edn","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2009-04-21T00:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":108.33,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2009-04-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:18:04Z","rounded_local_amount":336.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36007204,"comment":null},{"amount":108.44,"local_amount":333.67,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:45:30Z","rounded_local_amount":336.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44590886,"comment":null},{"amount":108.22,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:27:08Z","rounded_local_amount":336.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52985150,"comment":null},{"amount":108.33,"local_amount":333.32,"processed_date":"2009-07-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:14:35Z","rounded_local_amount":336.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63205492,"comment":null},{"amount":108.45,"local_amount":333.68,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T18:50:57Z","rounded_local_amount":336.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73634702,"comment":null},{"amount":108.23,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-09-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T22:44:48Z","rounded_local_amount":336.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87073949,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-04-21T09:13:00Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T22:44:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":102590,"name":"Dora","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dora A. is married with 3 children.

With her first loan of 300 soles and the desire to progress, she opened her business selling prepared food such as traditional \"juanes\" [boiled rice and meat wrapped in leaves] and anticuchos [marinated pieces of beef heart on skewers].  She later decided to change businesses and began raising and selling live chickens which she raises in the garden of her home in order to later offer them for sale in the main market of the city and to the owners of well-known restaurants.  With the loan of 2,000 soles which will be repaid in six months she will buy 100 young chicks to raise, balanced feed and vaccinations so that they will grow to be healthy and fat for later resale, as well as 20 roosters and 20 hens so that they will reproduce.  This business is very profitable.  She is the one who makes the decisions about the revenues and profits from her business; she is an enterprising woman, persevering and always looks to the future with great enthusiasm.

Luisa is 38 years old and lives with her partner and their five children, who are 13, 11, 6, 3, and 9 months old. Luisa works as a cook for the local Municipal. She cooks for Wawawasi (\u201cBaby house\u201d in Quechua), its childcare program, preparing meals for 11 babies and 55 children each day. She cooks alone, though she works with two people who help her serve the food. She cooks mostly stews.\r\n\r\nLuisa also raises small animals like pigs, guinea pigs and hens at her home. Right now, she has one pig and 30 to 40 guinea pigs (a Peruvian delicacy). She raises the animals from the time they are small, then fattens them up and sells them to buyers, who travel to Andahuaylillas from Cusco and bring the animals back to the city to cook and serve in restaurants. Luisa is requesting a loan of 1800 soles to buy hens and guinea pigs. Hens cost 12.50 soles per pair, and guinea pigs cost 22 soles per pair.
