She is a single mother and has a 6-year-old son called Jockmer.  They live together in their own home which Susana bought together with her ex-partner before they separated.  \r\n\r\nSusana's business is selling meals, soft drinks, hamburgers and pies which she makes to her own recipe.  She prepares all her food in her mother's house as it is closer to her sales location.  She also provides lunches to workers on a construction site at a school which makes her 25 orders a day.  This gives her a regular, fixed income.  She started her business with a loan from her sister who also works in this trade and who encouraged her, showing her the profits that the business makes.  She started off preparing her food in small quantities, with a certain amount of trepidation at first, but when she saw how she was managing to sell all the food she prepared, she decided to keep going.  She says that she has been in some financial tight spots in the past as she is both mother and father to her son who needs food and an education.  Given this need, she looked for a trade that would make enough to support him.  Now that she is making good profits, Susana would like her business to thrive and, in the future, she would like to open another business (a stationery store) in her home.\r\n\r\nThis will be Susana's fifth loan from MFP.  She feels grateful to know that she will have financial support as this makes her feel more certain that she will achieve her goals.  She feels happy to be a member of her community bank as she believes it to be a united and supportive group.  Susana will use the 3,000 soles that she has requested to invest in buying a vehicle.  She will buy a second-hand motorcycle taxi (which costs 2,000 soles).  This will save her having to pay for transportation when she delivers her meals to her diners.  She will use the remaining money to buy ingredients for preparing her food."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1013091,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy a motorcycle taxi and ingredients for preparing food","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-04T16:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-03T16:00:04Z","loan_amount":1125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Susana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":449.75},{"due_date":"2012-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":478.71},{"due_date":"2012-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":476.88},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":514.35},{"due_date":"2012-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":533.53},{"due_date":"2012-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":546.78}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.66},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.51},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":178.83},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.88},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200.08},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205.04}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-03-15T20:24:18Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":395937,"name":"Hellen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hellen is 33 years old and is the mother of 2 children.

Gisela lives with Horacio who is a salesman and the father of her two children, 12-year-old Chaline and 5-year-old Alison.  They live comfortably together in their own home which they worked very hard to buy.\r\n\r\nGisela's business is selling women's shoes that she buys through a catalog at affordable prices.  She also sells a range of clothing.  She sells the latest fashions for women, men and children and stocks up during her trips to the capital.  She sells all of her products from home to her friends, neighbors and family members.  She sells for cash and sometimes offers credit for up to 20 days.  She serves her customers in a kind and friendly manner which earns her their loyalty.\r\n\r\nGisela started her business five years ago with her own capital.  She got the idea from a friend who encouraged her to start selling.  Her sister helps her to attract new customers at her job, working for a public institution.\r\n\r\nGisela considers her business to be fairly profitable because of the money she makes and the demand that she has for her products.  She manages to sell all the clothing that she brings back from the capital.  Gisela did not have any problems before she started her business but she was really keen to make her own money and not depend solely on her partner's income.\r\n\r\nGiven the good results that she has experienced in her business, Gisela hopes to increase her stock of merchandise so that she can watch her business grow.  This will be her fourth loan from MFP.  She feels happy that she will have financial support in making progress in her business.

She has a great will to advance. She lives with her partner, Elvis, who is a laborer and the father of their three children, Liza, who is 18, Elvis, who is 14, and Brenda, who is 5. Together they live comfortably in their own house, which they bought with great effort.\r\n\r\nGriselda's business is selling beauty products such as nail polish, lipstick, lotions, and other items. She also sells a variety of clothing for women, men, and children, items in different styles and that are in fashion. She acquires all these products through catalogs and she sells them from her house to her friends, relatives, and neighbors, whom she serves in a kind and cordial manner, winning their business. Thus they recommend her to other people, who in time become regular customers.\r\n\r\nShe began this business more than four years ago, with a little capital of her own, and so far her sister and her daughter have helped her obtain new customers. She considers her business fairly profitable because of the earnings it provides her, along with the opportunity to be a prosperous businesswoman.\r\n\r\nBefore beginning her business, she had financial problems, since she was not practicing her profession of teaching, and she needed an income to continue paying for the education of their children, since her partner's income was only sufficient for food. Now, seeing her good results, she has plans to continue and with her earnings invest in arranging their house to refurbish rooms to rent, looking to generate more income.\r\n\r\nThis will be her fourth loan with MFP.  She is happy to know that she will have financial support to advance with her business. For this, she assures that she will be punctual in making her payments to have a good credit record and have access to more loans in the future.

She is married to Ronald, who is employed and the father of their 3 children who are 18, 12, and 2 years old.  They live comfortably together in their own home.  Amparo works in the sales of fast foods like broasted chicken, fried wings, \"salchipapas\" [fried hot dogs and french fries], and other things.  She sets up her cart every night in front of her house along with two tables with their chairs, where she attends very nicely to her customers, making their orders.  She has more than 6 years of experience in this business, counting on her eldest daughter's support in serving the customers.  She likes her business because of the economic income.  Furthermore, she likes the kitchen, and having the ability to support her husband with the household costs.  She thinks that her business is fairly profitable because of the good earnings that it gives her.  As such, she has plans to continue with her business and to begin selling grilled chicken, opening a rented location.  This will be her 11th loan with the MFP institution.  Therefore, she expects their collaboration so that she can finalize her plans.  Besides, she mentions feeling pleased with her communal bank because of the support that they receive to advance with their business.  With the amount requested of 1000 nuevos soles, she will invest in the purchase of ingredients to prepare the fast food such as oil, flour, chicken, and other items,  looking for the lowest prices for her cash purchases."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1008569,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"buy oils, flour, and chicken meat.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-04T20:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-03T20:10:02Z","loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Amparo ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":149.88},{"due_date":"2012-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":159.53},{"due_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":158.92},{"due_date":"2012-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":171.42},{"due_date":"2012-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":177.81},{"due_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":182.44}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.21},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.82},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.59},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.29},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.68},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.41}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-03-10T00:39:11Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":396370,"name":"Ruqaya","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ruqaya is a conservative person so she has asked her brother Mohammad to take her place in the photo.\r\n\r\nRuqaya is 30 years old and single.

Her customers want cold drinks and she provides them.  She's friendly and cordial because her customers want that too.  \r\nLleny started the business with an MFP loan and it was successful from the start.  She then used her profits to buy larger quantities of soft drinks.  She runs the business alone and says that it's profitable.  There's a lot of demand for cold drinks here because of the hot climate.\r\nLleny says that she didn't have any particular reason for starting the business.  She wanted something to do and a way to help her partner with household expenses.  She likes having an income of her own, though, and she wants to grow the business now.  \r\nThis will be Lleny's 11th MFP loan and she is grateful to the bank for helping her grow her business.

They live together in their own home, which they purchased after lots of effort. Floripes sells women\u2019s, men\u2019s, and children\u2019s clothing which her cousin sends from Lima for the different festivals. She also has a beauty salon where she offers services such as hair-cutting and dyeing, among others. She learned these skills by studying at an occupational education center. She is attentive in both sales and customer service, which earns her repeat customers. She has spent more than two years working in these businesses, and up until now has been working by herself.\r\nShe likes her business because of the economic return it provides her, the benefit of having a trade, and the feeling it gives her of being a productive person. She hopes to be able to spend more time at home to take care of her children and also to be a prosperous businesswoman. She considers her business to be reasonably profitable due to the demand for it and the good profits it provides her. As a result, she has plans to expand her beauty salon and convert it into a health spa, offering other services. This will be her third loan with MFP [Microfinanzas Prisma], and she is looking forward to working with MFP to be able to realize her plans. Additionally, she feels good about her communal bank due to the support which it continues to offer folks, providing them with an opportunity to benefit from a line of credit.

He is also kind and friendly, and has a great desire to do well in life.  He lives together with Mika who is a housewife and supports him in his agricultural work.  The couple have three children who are 17, 16 and 15 years old.  They work hard to provide them with a better quality of life.  The family live comfortably together in their own home.\r\n\r\nJuan's business is farming.  He has 60 hectares of farmland but only has 10 hectares sown with corn.  The corn is ready to be harvested and he already has buyers for it.  Juan started his business ten years ago with his own capital and the help of his partner.  They started sowing small quantities of crops but then expanded and increased their capacity owing to the demand they had for their produce.  Juan considers his business to be fairly profitable because his produce is in demand and he makes good profits, especially during periods when there is a shortage of corn.\r\n\r\nJuan started out in this business because he needed a trade and an income with which to support his family and provide them with a better quality of life.  Given the good results that he has had, he plans to expand his sowing capacity to 20 hectares as he has quite a lot of demand that he can't meet with his current production.  This will make him more profits and he will grow his business.\r\n\r\nThis will be Juan's third loan from MFP.  He feels happy that he will have financial support in making progress with his plans.  For this reason, he pledges to make his repayments on time as he did with his previous loans.  He says that he feels happy with his community bank as he considers the members to be good people.  Juan will invest the 2,000 soles he has requested in paying laborers to harvest his corn and get it ready to deliver to his buyer."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1013224,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to hire laborers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-04T23:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-03T23:10:02Z","loan_amount":750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-03-15T20:24:22Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":397789,"name":"Teopista","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Teopista lives in Kampala, Uganda.

Sin embargo considera dif\u00edcil las temporadas de lluvia ya que no puede elaborar el mantenimiento correspondiente; como fumigando y quitar las malezas que llegan a crecer entre sus plantaciones y a veces no cuenta con suficiente econom\u00eda para evitar los da\u00f1os que causan mala cosecha de su producci\u00f3n. Por tal motivo acude a los bancos de MFP para solicitar un pr\u00e9stamo que ayude con sus problemas. Este ser\u00e1 su cr\u00e9dito numero 02 con MFP, est\u00e1 dispuesta a realizar sus pagos puntualmente. En sus banco comunal es responsable con las actividades que realizan. Con los 1,000 nuevos soles, podr\u00e1 contratar peones para que le ayuden a desyerbar la maleza que aquejan sus plantas.\n\n","en":"29-year old Lourdes is single and lives in her own house. She is willing to go to a lot of trouble to obtain a better future for herself. She is energetically pursuing whatever needs to be done to achieve her objectives.\r\n\r\nLourdes works in the fields growing cocoa, a product that brings in a good income in the Palmapampa area. At harvest time she hires labourers to help her pick the cocoa quickly. The rainy season poses a problem as she cannot look after the fields as well as she would like; spreading insecticide and weeding between the plants are difficult to do then. Sometimes she cannot afford the supplies necessary to avoid a bad harvest. \r\n\r\nFor these reasons Lourdes has approached MFP for help with her problems. This will be her second loan with MFP. She promises to make the repayments punctually. She is a responsible member of her community bank. With the S\/.1000 loan Lourdes will contract labourers to help her weed the afflicted plants.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1013774,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to hire labourers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-05T01:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-04T01:30:07Z","loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lourdes ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":83.08},{"due_date":"2012-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":90.59},{"due_date":"2012-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":90.61},{"due_date":"2012-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":94.8},{"due_date":"2012-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":97.38},{"due_date":"2012-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":101.58},{"due_date":"2012-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":104.11},{"due_date":"2012-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":108.84},{"due_date":"2012-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":112.69},{"due_date":"2012-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":116.32}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.16},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.97},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.98},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.55},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.51},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.1},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.04},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.81},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.26},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-03-07T12:02:09Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":396597,"name":"Teodora","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Teodora, de 35 a\u00f1os, vive en su propia casa junto a su esposo Sixto de 42 a\u00f1os y sus 04 queridos hijos a quienes desea una mejor calidad de vida.

She is married to Nando, who works for himself, and they are the parents of children who are now grown-up and financially independent.  They live in their own home together with one of their sons, Ricardo, who is 24 years old.\r\n\r\nThe work that Gloria does is selling ceviche, which is a traditional dish in Peruvian cuisine.  She sells from premises that are located in her home, which saves her paying rent.  She tells that she began this business when her daughter came into some capital over three years ago.  Her daughter had the idea to begin this business, so they partnered together and began selling only on the weekends.  They sold to neighbors and also went door-to-door looking to find customers.  Later on, they set up a space in their home with tables and chairs to serve their new customers comfortably.  They have now increased the days on which they sell, and have two people helping with serving whom they pay weekly.  Her daughter is in charge of preparing the ceviche.  Gloria considers her business to be quite profitable, as it provides good earnings and they have been able to gain a regular clientele.  She comments that she began this work due to the necessity of having additional income, and to support her daughter in making the business a reality.  She saw that is was a good idea for them to venture into this, earning good results thanks to their efforts.\r\n\r\nShe now wants to expand her business with more tables and chairs for the comfort of her customers.  This will be her third loan with the MFP lending institution.  She is grateful to know that she can count on a line of credit to make her plans reality.  On the other hand, she says that she enjoys being part of her communal bank, as she considers them to be a united and responsible group.\r\n\r\nWith the requested sum of 1,000 new soles, she will invest in the purchase of cooking utensils such as plates and glasses, and also in furniture such as tables and chairs.  The balance will go towards preparing ceviche."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1013855,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase ingredients to prepare more food, and also buy cooking utensils, tables and chairs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-05T02:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-04T02:40:05Z","loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gloria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":149.88},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":159.53},{"due_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":158.92},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":171.42},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":177.81},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":182.44}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.21},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.82},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.59},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.29},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.68},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.41}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-03-09T14:57:07Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":397892,"name":"Heyam","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Heyam is a 37-year-old woman.

She began this business more than 7 years ago with some of her own capital, the fruit of her and her partner's savings, and so far she has been working alone. She considers her business fairly profitable, since in these areas she manages to sell at higher prices and has higher profit margins.\r\n\r\nBefore she began her business, she had financial problems, since her partner's income was not sufficient and her family was growing. Furthermore, the prices of food were also increasing. Then she decided to generate her own income to help with the household finances. Now she would like to invest her earnings in a grocery store in her house, so that she can spend more time near her children. This will be her fourth loan with MFP.

She is separated from the father of her son Fabricio, who is 3 years old. She lives in her father's house with her son, her mother, and her father, who help her to raise her son. Ibethsi's business is selling food such as juanes (a stuffed dish similar to a tamal, containing rice, spices, and meat, fish or yucca), noodles, and other items in the mornings. To do this she has a stall in the market near her home where she serves her customers in a friendly and cordial manner, winning their business.\r\n\r\nShe began more than 10 years ago, using her own capital and preparing in small quantities. Seeing the reception that her business had, she decided to continue, and so far she has had help from her mother in preparing the food and serving customers, and she shares her earnings with her. She feels that her business is fairly profitable because she almost always sells everything she prepares, giving her good earnings. She decided to begin this business because of the need to have a job and an income to cover her expenses and those of her son, since she is separated from her partner.\r\n\r\nSeeing the good results she is having with her business, she has plans to continue it and make it grow.

She is a widow and raised her two children alone.  Now they are 32 and 20 and economically independent, but they still live at home.  She takes care of a one-year-old grandson and works hard for a better lifestyle and quiet retirement.  Mirna runs a diner out of her home in the evenings from Monday to Saturday.  On Sundays and holidays she sells \"cebiche\" (fish dish) and grilled food.  She has been in business for four years and it has grown considerably so she keeps on working.  She enjoys her job because it allows her to help her son with her grandson, while also taking care of other household activities.  Being an enterprising woman, she has many plans for the future; and even though she has been able to get ahead, there is still room to grow.\r\n\r\nNow she wants to begin heating the area in her house where she attends to customers, and she wants to set up a new business.  This is her seventh loan through the MFP institution and she is counting on your support to continue with her goals.  She is committed to paying back the loan on time as she has done with previous loans.  She enjoys being in her communal bank because all the members are punctual and responsible.\r\n\r\nShe plans to use the 1,000 PEN loan to buy supplies and firewood to heat her diner."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1014167,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"To buy supplies and firewood for her diner.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-05T08:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-04T08:30:02Z","loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mirna ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":145.06},{"due_date":"2012-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":153.21},{"due_date":"2012-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":167.05},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":173.28},{"due_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":176.31},{"due_date":"2012-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":185.09}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.4},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.45},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.65},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.98},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.11},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.41}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-03-08T16:56:23Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":399765,"name":"Afia De Diatamine Safere Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Le groupe Afia de Diatamine Saf\u00e9r\u00e9 est cr\u00e9\u00e9 en d\u00e9cembre 2008 \u00e0 l'inauguration du BV.

This will offer her family better and more suitable home furniture and will let them live in better conditions.\n\n\nAbout this loan product:\nFATEN offers loans that are customized for Muslim borrowers. A key principle of Islam is the prohibition of charging interest on a loan. This prohibition is based on the belief that money is only a medium of exchange and has no value in itself. In order to offer loans in a manner that is consistent with borrowers' values, FATEN charges 0% interest on this loan. However, FATEN does charge a servicing fee to cover its costs. The loan amount you see listed on Kiva includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you according to this loan\u2019s repayment schedule.

Over time, with the support of his parents, he was able to acquire some farmland.  He formed his household and built a house.  Benjam\u00edn currently has three plots of fertile land where he produces annatto and coffee.  \"With each harvest I have 1,500 kilos of annatto and 300 kilos of coffee\", he says.  Benjam\u00edn sells his crops retail.  He transports his fruit to the city of Pichanaki where he has a sales stall.  There he sells his coffee and annatto by the kilo.\r\n\r\nBenjam\u00edn has been in this business for five years.  He believes that, over the years, he will be able to expand his land and grow other crops.  He will also be able to sell wholesale as the results of this are immediate and you avoid the produce spoiling.  One of Benjam\u00edn's plans is to start buying and selling fruit which he will acquire in his town and then sell in the wholesale market in his district.  \r\n\r\nThis will be Benjam\u00edn's third loan from MFP and he pledges to be punctual in making his monthly repayments.  He says that he feels supported by his community bank 'Productores de Inchatingari' because his fellow group members share the same plans as him.  He will invest his money in buying work tools such as machetes and tool sharpeners which he will use on his coffee plantations.

She is married to Jorge, who is a merchant and father of their three children: Jorge, 18; Jaky, 6; and Pablo, 5. They live together in their own home that they bought with a lot of hard work and collaboration. Luz makes a living making and selling brooms out of a small workshop in her home. She has two machines to cut the sticks and bristles, and then she assembles them to ensure a good product. All of her products are sold wholesale to nearby merchants, where she has delivery orders thanks to the good service she provides. She started more than 18 years old with her own money and the support of her husband, who helps her in making and selling the brooms. Sometimes her eldest son helps out as well. She considers the business to be quite lucrative due to the profits she generates and the regular customer base that buys up everything she produces. Before starting the business she had some financial problems because she didn't have a trade or regular income, making the household finances difficult. She didn't want to see her children to suffer, so she decided to work. Now she sees the good results from her job, and she wants to continue because it is her only source of income. This will be her sixth loan with Kiva partner MFP, and she is very content knowing she has financial support and can continue advancing with her business. She also says that she enjoys her work with her community bank because of the supportive people. She plans to use the loan to purchase materials to make brooms, like sticks and straw bristles, at lower prices by buying in bulk, and thus increase her profits."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1013927,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase sticks and straw bristles to make brooms.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-05T19:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-04T19:30:03Z","loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":154.86},{"due_date":"2012-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":151.25},{"due_date":"2012-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":164.92},{"due_date":"2012-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":171.07},{"due_date":"2012-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":174.06},{"due_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":183.84}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.07},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.72},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.85},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.15},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.27},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.94}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-03-12T11:43:30Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":396690,"name":"Adilia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Adilia, de 43 a\u00f1os de edad, es una mujer trabajadora y empe\u00f1osa, adem\u00e1s de ser amable y alegre.
