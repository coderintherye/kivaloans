LanoK. is 40 years old and married with three children, ages 10 months to 2 years.

She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be about $142 per week) to improve her business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Taiaopo joined SPBD and this is her 3rd loan with them.

A. is 38 years old and married with four children, ages 5 to 15.  She owns a business venture, planting and harvesting taro for sale.  She has three years of experience in this business.  \r\n\r\nKalala needs a loan of 1,000 WST to purchase general farm supplies and equipment.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be about $138 per week) to improve her business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Kalala joined SPBD, and this is her 3rd loan with them. SPBD's loans are Kalala's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD:\r\n\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD, and since then it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

K. is 47 years old.  She lives in Ak-Dobo village in the north of Kyrgyzstan and has four children: one son, who is married and lives on his own, two daughters who are students, and one son of school age. \r\n\r\nKalimahan has a higher teacher's education, and during the last twenty-four years she has been working as a teacher of the German language in a local school.  She is characterized by her colleagues as a responsible, precise and sociable person.  Also, Kalimahan is a member of the non-government organization named \u201cPlanet -21\u201d and takes part in implementing the project of greenhouse construction.   Kalimahan\u2019s husband works in the local school as a physical training teacher. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, salaries of teachers in rural areas are very low.  That\u2019s why in 1995 Kalimahan, using her starting capital of 17,000 KGS, began to engage in stock-breeding. She bought milk cows, whose milk she sold to her customers at the local market.  Also, Kalimahan\u2018s family began to cultivate kidney beans, potatoes and red beets on a plot of land. They worked hard to get a good harvest. Using the revenues from selling the harvest, Kalimahan paid for the education of her children. \r\n\r\nKalimahan  plans to use this loan of 60,000 KGS to buy three sheep and one milk cow. She expects to increase the sales of milk and also acquire new customers.

A. is 22 years old and single with one child.

She has three years of experience in this business.  \r\n\r\nTolotea needs a loan of 1,750 WST to purchase general farm supplies and equipment.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be about $125 per week) to improve the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Tolotea joined SPBD and this is her 3rd loan with them.

L. is 44 and married with 6 children (ages 9 - 30). She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale. Lealofi has 4 years of experience in this business. Lealofi needs a loan of WST$1500 to purchase general farm supplies & equipment. She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 300 talas or US $125 per week) to improve and expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Lealofi joined SPBD. This is her 6th loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Lealofi's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD:\r\n\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.

Rodina has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Rodina is requesting a new loan of 11000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. This loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by Rodina from HSPFI.

She makes her home here in a simple structure with her long-term partner and 3 children and 3 nephews. She says that her most difficult challenges are raise her children and her nephews because after Haiti's earthquake, she needs to take care of them, because they were homeless and had lost family there.  In the meantime she plans to continue enjoying eating and watching television.\r\n\r\nIsabel is excited to be taking her 5th loan with Esperanza after having successfully repaid her previous loan and grown her business. She has had her business for over 4 and a half years, starting with her first loan, with which she bought a stove and gas tank to fry food. She plans to use this loan to invest in her businesses, She sells fried food in her fried food stand and she wants to use this loan to buy big bags or packets of wallets and shoes. She will use the profits to buy school supplies, shoes, and give better food to her big family, She wants to buy a home and have all her family together in a better house.\r\n \r\nThis Esperanza associate began with us because she need a loan to start a business and the Esperanza program went to her community. Her  story is representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican clients generally, many of whom recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti. Her group is located in the urban slums surrounding Santo Domingo. This area, like nearly all impoverished areas of the Dominican Republic, suffers from unreliable running water (none of which is potable) and unreliable electricity.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3875,"image":{"id":578773,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"to

D. was born in Belovodskoe village (near the capital of Kyrgyzstan), where she still lives. She is 63 years old.  Tatyana was born in a low-income family and from early childhood, she had to help her parents around the house. \r\n\r\nTatyana got married at the age of 23. Soon she gave birth to two daughters and one son. Her husband served as an inspector in a juvenile colony, and Tatyana got a job as a cleaner in a local school. Their salaries didn\u2019t cover all expenses of the household. In order to support her family, Tatyana decided to start animal breeding. Using the small amount of 1,000 Kyrgyz Soms, she bought goats and rabbits. Later on, her livestock grew and she got milk cows, whose milk she sold to a dairy factory.\r\n\r\nIn 1998, Tatyana divorced her husband and became the only breadwinner for her children. During the next five years, Tatyana married her daughters off. In 2006, Tatyana\u2019s son got married; at the same time her grandson was born, which further raised the family\u2019s expenditures. Because of this, Tatyana had to sell most of her cattle. Today she has only 20 rabbits at her farm.\r\n\r\nNow Tatyana is requesting a loan of 30,000 Kyrgyz Soms to buy ten pigs and one bull. That will allow her to further develop her household and business. \r\nIn future, Tatyana plans to help her son buy a house. \r\n\r\nBai-Tushum and Partners uses Kiva funding to target the especially vulnerable population.

There are 11 members in total, and the majority of them grow corn, rice, soy, plantains, papaya, and other crops. \r\n\r\nMartana works in agriculture. She has corn, rice, cacao, coffee, and soy. She sells her products in Mata de Cacao and she goes every week to make purchases and sales.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting the loan to buy fertilizers and insecticides for pests. With the support of this loan she will improve her life and continue growing. Her dream is to continue with her business. She is afraid that if things don\u2019t go well, she won\u2019t make progress. If they do go well, she will earn, says Martana.\r\n\r\nIn her free time she likes to do things around the house. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jennifer Day, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":578863,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy fertilizers and insecticides for agriculture ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Chillanes","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":159,"posted_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Martana Ingrid ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":800,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":800}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":800,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:45:49Z","rounded_local_amount":800,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227012319,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-09-04T21:02:57Z","paid_date":"2011-09-15T08:45:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":220189,"name":"Esperar En Dios Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Grupo originario de Sumpango, Sac., Do\u00f1a Valentina se dedica a la agricultura un negocio que le ha sido rentable, ya que la tierra donde trabaja es muy fertil, Rosario hija de do\u00f1a Valentina se dedica a vender panes en su casa, ella desea ampliar su venta y ofrecer otros productos b\u00e1sicos, La hija menor Hilda se dedica a tejer fajas tip\u00edcas, ellas han sido anteriormente clientas con FAPE y hoy agradecen a Kiva por ayudarles a cumplir sus sue\u00f1os.","en":"This group is from Sumpango, Sac.

She has been making pi\u00f1atas for four years, as this was something her family has been doing for a long time and she enjoyed the work.  At the beginning it was difficult to bring in customers since she was just starting, so she decided to equip herself with a catalog of the different figures, which she could show to customers.  This way, people could get to know her work.  Through perseverance, she has succeeded in having her pi\u00f1atas sold in commercial centers and candy shops.  Her sales increase during the December holidays and drop a bit at the beginning of the year, but for her this is no reason to lose motivation and she keeps working.  Her plans are to expand her business and to have more people know her work.  She will use the requested loan to buy materials like different colors of tissue paper, glue, cardboard, etc., and to bring in a little more income to invest in her children's education.\r\n\r\nMahanaim is grateful for the the support offered by Kiva through Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad, as it will help them to reach their goals.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Katie

He and his wife and two children live in their own home.  He works at his business every day, raising and selling pork. His product is very sought out in the market because the livestock are always well nourished and large in size. Every day since very early in the morning he wakes to feed the livestock to make them grow. He attends to them with a great deal of care because he knows that it is thanks to them that he will earn the income to support his family.  During the 8 years he has been running this business he had to battle against swine flu incidents, damaging his business and depleting his sales. But today the situation has improved considerably, and to maintain it he has been careful to feed them well.  In the future he hopes to set up corrals so that he may keep larger numbers of livestock. This is the third loan he has requested from Elizabet en MFP (Kiva Field Partner) and he is committed to make his payments on time.  With this loan he hopes to purchase more feed for the livestock and also to purchase two more pigs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Erika Lindig, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":578929,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase two pigs and feed.

Her business is toy sales, adjusting the items she carries according to the time of year and special national holidays. The stand she occupies is rented space. It is located in the market, the most visited market in the district. All her sales are finalized in cash only. She pays special attention to cordiality and customer service, which is why her sales are always so good. She has been at this business for the past 6 years and she loves doing what she does.

She lives with her husband, who is a professional photographer, and with their three children, aged 14, 10 and 5. Zoila works in her own photogrpahy studio where she takes different types of photogrpahs such as for titles, diplomas, souvenirs, and more.  She and her husband do the work, which is very much in demand in the area, since there are few businesses like it and they have good references for doing such professional work. They also sell camera accessories in their studio such as photographic film, video tapes, picture frames and other products. Sustaining this business is very important to Zoila since it is the only source of work that she and her husband have. That is why it is vital to invest in order to keep going forward. Zoila is asking for a loan so that she can have enough money to buy a flash for the cameras, tripods, and also higher quality cameras.

R. is 21 years old.  She lives in San Francisco Gotera, a municipality in the Moraz\u00e1n department.  She lives with her husband and their two children, a one year old and a three year old.\r\n\r\nMarta works with her husband in their own business, which they started two years ago.  They buy cows and butcher them in order to later sell the meat.  This business is very stable.  In spite of their short time in the business, they have many customers.  This is due to the fact that they have very good references and they are very responsible in what they do.\r\n\r\nMarta is requesting a loan to be able to buy more cattle.  The price of cattle is pretty high.  That is why they need a loan from Integral in order to increase their inventory.  This way sales will improve.  The loan will allow them to sell their products to more people and make their business grow.  That is what Marta and her husband want most of all.  That way they will be able to improve their economic stability.  They will also improve themselves as business people, and they will be perfecting their work day to day.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

She lives with her 66 year old grandmother and her 74 year old grandfather.  Dora is a hard-working young woman.  She works hard to help out at home, and, above all, she works to be able to support her grandparents.  They are elderly, and it is hard for them to work.\r\n\r\nShe put a mill in her house, and she uses it to grind beans, corn, salsa ingredients, and a lot of other food.  She has the advantage of having the only mill in the vicinity of her house.  She has a lot of customers due to the fact that there are various people selling \u201cpupusas\u201d (flatbread stuffed with meat, cheese, or vegetables) and tortillas.  The vendors go to her everyday to grind the ingredients to make the food.\r\n\r\nDora is requesting a loan because she wants to be able to buy another mill.  The new mill will allow her to take care of more customers.  At some hours of the day the business is swamped, and that gets in the way of taking care of more customers.  That is a negative for her.  She also wants to be able to provide the needed maintenance on the mill that she already has.  She will buy all of the replacement parts that are needed to do a better job.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

Por lo general recibe la ayuda de su pareja, pero en temporada de cosecha necesita de sus peones, para que de esa manera lo ayuden a trasladar su producto hacia los puntos de venta y a un precio competitivo.

They live together in the town of Santa Rosa, located in Ayacucho's tropical rainforest, where they have their own house.\r\n\r\nIt all began when her parents gave her a small plot of land so she could work and grow cocoa and coffee, but she never thought that she would like it so much.  Once she reached adulthood, her parents gave Alejandra her independence, and of course her parents were keeping an eye on their daughter's progress.  Now she sells to the big wholesalers in her town, who give her a good profit margin with respect to her previous sales.  At any rate, she is grateful to her parents for the good lessons they gave her.\r\n\r\nAlejandra generally receives help from her husband, but at harvest time she needs hired workers to help her get her products to the sales points and sell at a competitive price.  Her future plans are to expand her production so that she can earn more income.\r\n\r\nThis is her fifth loan with MFP, and she promises to continue paying on schedule.  Besides, she is happy with her communal bank, as it gives her many benefits.  Alejandra is thinking of investing the requested loan in maintenance for her cocoa fields, with the goal of preventing anything that could adversely affect their production.\r\n\r\n<br

She lives in the town of San Agust\u00edn which is located in Usulut\u00e1n Department, where she lives with her husband.\r\n\r\nAna sells fish, and her business is located in the municipal market of San Agust\u00edn, which is found in a shellfish area, so there is a large amount of competition here.  For this reason Ana wants to invest in the business, buying greater amounts of fish as well as a greater variety of seafood like shrimp, crabs and others, which would guarantee that she can outdo the competition.\r\n\r\nAna has several customers who buy her products weekly, which has permitted her to count on a stable business, but what Ana wants most is to have a stronger business that will increase her sales.

She lives in her own home in the town of Santo Rosa, which is located on the edge of the Peruvian jungle.  Guillermina remembers first getting involved in farming when she was a teenager, helping with the chores that were given to her by her parents.  Today she produces and sells agricultural products such as cacao and coca leaves.  Her most frequent customers are satisfied with the quality of the products she offers.  As a result, she has gained a strong position in the local market since her sales have improved compared to her previous harvests.  Guillermina normally receives assistance from her children during the planting and harvesting seasons.  Her normal work schedule is from 7am to 6pm, Monday through Saturday.  The crops she produces are sold at the local collection centers.  Guillermina is not content at the moment, so she plans to acquire more land in hopes of producing on a larger scale and generating more income.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis is her thirteenth loan with MFP.  Guillermina is confident that she will faithfully complete her payments.  She is happy with her Communal Bank because the others are also committed with their payments.

Their children are 6, 5 and 3 years old respectively.  They live together in their own home in the Santa Rosa neighborhood of the beautiful Ayacuchan jungle.  When she was very young, Irene's parents suffered a decline in their agricultural production.  Because of that, their income was reduced to the point that they didn't even have food to eat.  With time, they ventured into the area of carpentry, and they managed to survive.  Currently, her partner helps her in all aspects, and due to their tireless efforts, they were granted their reward.  Today their workshop, where they sell a wide variety of furniture that they make themselves, is well positioned in their neighborhood. Because of that, they earn a good profit, compared with earlier years.  Irene recognizes that the key componenet of their success is their love of the work.  She normally works with her husband, and together they make a good team, but at times they need additional workers to speed up the fabrication of the furniture.  Their daily routine starts at 8:00 in the morning and lasts until 8:00 at night.  Their point of sale is in the same nieghborhood they live in.

While each member of the group receives an individual L., they all are responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is V\u1ecdng Nguy\u1ec7t nh\u00f3m 03 (Nh\u00f3m 03).\r\n\r\nT. is married and has 1 adult -aged child. She owns and operates a business raising livestock for sale. T. has been engaged in this business for over 25 years and earns approximately 3,000,000 VND a month from it.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, T. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. T. has successfully repaid a previous L. of 4,704,000 VND from SEDA. This previous L. was used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future. She is now requesting a new L. of 7,392,000 VND which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future. This will be the 4th L. taken out by T. from SEDA. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's general living conditions.\r\n\r\nAbout the other borrowers in the group:\r\n\r\n1.  Ng\u00f4 Th\u1ecb L.

Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n\r\nT.

She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's general living conditions.\r\n\r\nAbout SEDA:\r\n\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to the low income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the Northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n\r\nD.

She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures: a general store and a pig fattening business. Her husband, Manuel D., who is 50 years old, works as a family driver to earn his living and he also helps in his wife's business activities. They have 2 children who are 24 and 26 years old. \r\n\r\nConchita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 16 cycle loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Conchita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 22,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 5,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 17th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 29,500, which she intends to use as additional capital so that she can continue to save up for their future and to fight the daily battle of their lives. Conchita D. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

O. is a 59-year old married woman who supports her family by operating 3 business ventures: a TV & Refrigerator repair shop, Farming and a General Store business. She lives in T. Alonzo St., Poblacion, Madredijos, Cebu City. \r\n\r\nShe has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2000 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her TV & Refrigerator repair shop, Farming and General Store businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP5,000. \r\n\r\nLydia is now borrowing PHP 23,000 so that she could use it to purchase additional materials for her business. This will be her 18th cycle loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP20,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom. Lydia aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nShown in photo: Lydia together with her husband in her shop. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

She earns her living by operating 3 business ventures: food vending, pig fattening and sewing sack bags businesses. Her husband Renerio P. Sr, who is 49 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have 5 children who are 17 to 28 years old. \r\n\r\nTeresita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 14 cycle loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Teresita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 5,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 15th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000 which she intends to use as an additional working capital so that she could continue to save up for their future and to provide her children with good education. Teresita P. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She lives in Brgy. Kaungkod, Madredijos, Cebu. \r\n\r\nTessie has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2002, and has improved her living conditions with the help of loans from NWTF and by her own efforts. By working hard in her pig fattening and egg businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of 10,000 Philippine pesos (PHP). \r\n\r\nTessie is now borrowing 20,000 PHP to use as additional capital. This will be her twelfth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 12,000 PHP (which she paid off well within its term) was just another step on her journey towards economic freedom. Tessie hopes to improve her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the <i>Dungganon<\/i> way. \r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project <i>Dungganon<\/i> (a Hiligaynon word that means <u>honorable<\/u>). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them <i>Dungganon<\/i> - a title of esteem  that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

To making a living, T. owns and operates a manufacturing business.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from manufacturing and selling wood products to local businesses and community members.  T. has been engaged in this business for over three years and earns approximately 3.000.000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2009, T. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities.  T. has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5.152.000 VND from SEDA.  This previous loan was used to purchase raw materials to manufacture additional products.  She is now requesting a new loan of 6.496.000 VND which will also be used to purchase raw materials to manufacture additional products.  The loan will be the second loan taken out by the borrower from SEDA.  T. plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support extended members of her family.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout the other borrowers in the group:\r\n<p>\r\n1.

E. is a married woman who lives in Prk. Lerio, Brgy. Vito, Sagay City, Negros Occidental.  She earns her living by operating three business ventures: buying and selling religious articles, vegetable vending and running a general store.\r\n<p>\r\nCecilia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1998 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 14 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Cecilia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis time, for her 15th loan, she is borrowing PHP 21,000 which she intends to use as additional capital for her religious articles business. Her goal is to continue to save up for their future, provide a good education for her children and to sustain their daily needs. \r\n<p>\r\nCecilia E. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n<p>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (dungganon is a Hiligaynon word that means honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She earns her living by operating three business ventures: buying and selling livestock, grains and rice. Her husband Harley, who is 51 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities. They have three children who are 27 to 31 years old. \r\n\r\nCarmen joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1999 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 13 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Carmen has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 20,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 14th loan, she is borrowing PHP 22,000 ,which she intends to use for expansion of her rice, grains and livestock businesses so that she can continue to save up for their future and to purchase land which will be used for farming. Carmen C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

To making a living, C. owns and operates a business in the agriculture sector raising livestock.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income comes from raising cattle to sell.  C. has been engaged in this business for over five years and earns approximately 3.000.000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2008, C.  joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities.

She is now requesting a new loan of 3.808.000 VND which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies.  The loan will be the third she has taken out from SEDA.

P. owns & operates a livestock business, raising pigs for sale. She has been engaged in this business for over 20 years and earns approximately 1.700.000 VND a month.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2008, P. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities.  P. has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4.256.000 VND from SEDA. This previous loan was used to purchase breeding livestock. She is now requesting a new loan of 5.152.000 VND which will be used to purchase livestock feed & other supplies. This will be the 3rd loan taken out by P. from SEDA. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout SEDA:\r\n\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to the low income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the Northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n\r\nP.

She has operated a retail shop for one and a half years now.  She works from 6 am to 8:30 pm daily and she is able to make a monthly profit of about $186.\r\n\r\nThis will be Magreth\u2019s second motisha loan from Tujijenge Tanzania.  A motisha loan is a product offered by Tujijenge Tanzania that allows borrowers with good credit ratings to pay back their original loans faster and receive extra money before their original loan term has ended.

F. is from the village of South Cogon, Misamis Oriental.

Letecia has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 8000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Letecia joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7000 PHP from HSPFI, which was used to invest in expanding the business. Letecia is requesting a new loan of 4000 PHP which will be used to purchase materials needed to provide business services. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Letecia from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

He is polygamous and lives with his wives and children in the Darsalam II neighborhood of Koutiala (Sikasso Region). He did not attend school for social reasons.  Thus, he took up his father's line of business at a young age and has operated it for himself for 10 years. He is much sought after by his customers because the less costly and better quality second-hand clothing is much appreciated in Mali. In order to satisfy customer demand, Mr. C. turned to the Soro Yiriwaso microfinance institution, where he has his first loan. He plans to buy 5 bales of second-hand clothing at Burkina Faso with this loan. He conducts his sales principally in cash at the large market in Koutiala under his shed roof to a clientele composed of women and men. With this loan, he expects to make a monthly profit of 100,000 CFA to support himself; namely, to repay the loan, to provide for his family and to invest the rest in his business.  In the future, he plans to expand his buiness in order to attract more customers.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Connie Archea, Kiva

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She has 3 children and two are still attending school. She has run a tailoring business from her home since 1984 when she decided to start a home business to support her husband with the family expenses. She works at the request of clients, making different designs of clothes, robes, shirts, pants, etc. in addition to clothing repair. She also does embroidery work. She is requesting a $1000 loan from Kiva partner Ameen s.a.l. to purchase additional textiles and a new sewing machine. She specifically notes that she will be able to deliver her services faster because of the new machine. In the future, she would like to expand her client base and she hopes to open a small tailoring factory.\r\n \r\nNote: Based on the political and social challenges of Lebanon, personally identifiable attributes of this entrepreneur have been altered to protect him or her (i.e., blacking out portions of the entrepreneur in his\/her picture, not indicating his\/her name and location, etc.) Ameen s.a.l. appreciates Kiva lenders' understanding of these challenges and encourages lenders to continue their support for Lebanon's borrowers.\r\n\r\nAbout Ameen:\r\nAmeen s.a.l. has been a major player in the Lebanese Microfinance sector since 1999. Originally, a micro-credit program created by CHF International, Ameen evolved to become Ameen s.a.l. in 2003, a Lebanese services company. In 2007, Ameen s.a.l. registered with the Central Bank of Lebanon to become the first Lebanese financial institution specialized in Microfinance.\r\n\r\nAt Ameen s.a.l. we pledge to provide financial services to the largest number of micro and small entrepreneurs and to the working poor, to help them develop their businesses and improve their incomes.\r\n\r\nAmeen has been able to use its interest-free loans Kiva to offer lower-interest loans with faster disbursement for their micro-loan borrowers. Since its inception, Ameen has provided high-quality financial services to over 41,000 borrowers and disbursed over 81,000 loans totaling $115 million.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

From a 3-acre area, Mrs. Korotoumou B. hopes to get 8 bags of millet, 18 bags of peanuts and about 30 cups of okra. A part of the crop of grains will be used, and the rest sold.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She lives in a big traditional family in the Darsalam neighborhood of S\u00e9gou (fourth administrative region of the Republic of Mali.) \r\n\r\nNot having attended school for socio-economic reasons, she began at a young age to do petty trading together with her mother who sold condiments. After several years' apprenticeship, she was well versed in that commercial activity. She learned dyeing during her stay in S\u00e9gou from a lady for whom she was working as a maid. She has been working in this trade for 15 years and has a lot of experience and is well-known. Her strength in sales is due not only to the quality of her dyeing but also of her cloth. \r\n\r\nTo do her dyeing, she dilutes the various products used for modern and traditional cloth dyeing in hot water. Then she soaks the white fabrics in this liquid to give them the desired color. Then the dyed cloth is hung out on a line to dry. After that she brings them to the seamstress and once the clothes are sewn, they are  washed and ironed and carefully wrapped.  \r\n\r\nWishing to grow her working capital so as to make more profit, she came to Soro Yiriwaso. She is on her first loan which she intends to use to buy two \"less rich\" lengths of \"bazin\" (damask).

He lives with his family and 6 siblings. He is a relatively new business owner - he started working as a flooring worker almost three years ago.  His story illustrates the day-to-day challenges many people are facing in trying to help their families with their business income. Despite his situation, he feels positive about his business potential for the coming year because during those three years, he has been able to build a good business reputation. He is requesting to borrow $1000 from Kiva partner Ameen s.a.l. to buy tools for a project renovating a small building. And he will also purchase a small car to facilitate his transportation to the projects he works on. In the future, he looks forward to taking on bigger projects in his community. \r\n \r\nNote: Based on the political and social challenges of Lebanon, personally identifiable attributes of this entrepreneur have been altered to protect him or her (i.e., blacking out portions of the entrepreneur in his\/her picture, not indicating his\/her name and location, etc.). Ameen s.a.l. appreciates Kiva lenders' understanding of these challenges and encourages lenders to continue their support for Lebanon's borrowers.\r\n\r\nAbout Ameen:\r\nAmeen s.a.l. has been a major player in the Lebanese Microfinance sector since 1999. Originally, a micro-credit program created by CHF International, Ameen evolved to become Ameen s.a.l. in 2003, a Lebanese services company. In 2007, Ameen s.a.l. registered with the Central Bank of Lebanon to become the first Lebanese financial institution specialized in Microfinance.\r\n\r\nAt Ameen s.a.l. we pledge to provide financial services to the largest number of micro and small entrepreneurs and to the working poor, to help them develop their businesses and improve their incomes.\r\n\r\nAmeen has been able to use its interest-free loans Kiva to offer lower-interest loans with faster disbursement for their micro-loan borrowers. Since its inception, Ameen has provided high-quality financial services to over 41,000 borrowers and disbursed over 81,000 loans totaling $115 million.

He was the youngest child in a large family, where all the children helped their parents in the household and they cultivated land and pastured cattle. After graduating from secondary school and serving in the Army, Aidarbek got married. His parents gave a milk cow to the couple, thereby making a distinctive contribution to the start of Aidarbek\u2019s business.\r\n\r\nAidarbek is a hard worker and his strong efforts allowed him to broaden his business with three cows and two bulls. His wife milks the cows and sells about 20 liters of milk daily to the loyal customers. Also, Aidarbek cultivates a small plot of land with red beets and cabbage. Aidarbek plans to use this loan of 50,000 Kyrgyz Soms to buy one milk cow and sheep, because it\u2019s a good way to find the means for subsistence of the five member family. \r\n\r\nAidarbek believes strongly that his children will become educated in the future.

Farmers & Traders B, Kihihi Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As they say, determination is a key to success. T. Jovlet, a happily married mother of 5 children, ventured into tea growing in Nyamirambi, Kihihi, over 10 years ago.

It's located in Hueyapan in the Mexican state of Morelos.  The group has 5 members, all neighbors who have long known one another.  This is the group's first Fundacion Realidad loan.  \r\nSra. Aurelia P. A., a member of the group, is 56 years old.  She has 2 children: a son, Orlando, 30, and a daughter, Maria Isabel, 22.  Sra. Aurelia owns a grocery store and sells wholesale supplies of fruits, avocados and nuts.  She is applying for a loan to buy cooking oil, soap, toilet paper, salt, sugar, eggs, cold drinks, different kinds of chiles and sweets that she will resell in her store.  She started the business 15 years ago because she needed the income from it to live after her husband died.  He left her a small farm planted with avocado trees.  Her son helped her with the farm work, fertilizing the fields.  She goes to the Yecaplixtla market on Tuesdays and Fridays to sell bulk supplies of avocadoes and nuts.  She sells in Ozumba, as well.  Sra. Aurelia's daughter helps her with the housework and tends the store when she is away.  The business is in her house in the San Bartolo neighborhood of Hueyapan.  The store is called Lucero.  Sra. Aurelia has a truck in which she carries her goods to market, but it's in poor condition and needs new tires.  She has had to rent a truck recently which has been a drain on her income.  She would like to sell her goods in Ozumba because she can make more money there at a time when the store is barely getting by.  The earnings from the store go to paying the family's everyday expenses.  Earnings from the wholesale business are reinvested: buying nut trees; harvesting the nuts; packing them; buying fertilizer for the fields and the avocado trees; and using a tractor to prepare the land for new plantings.  Sra. Aurelia's hopes for the future are to reach a ripe old age, in good health and still able to work, and that her children be well and happy. She is pleased to get the loan and she will use it to buy more things for her business.  There are many kinds of trees in San Bartolo--pines, flowered trees, pear, peach, tejocotes, apple, etc.  The climate is cold.\r\nThe members of the group are Sra. Marcela R. F., who will buy fruits and vegetables to resell; Sra. Dominga Sandoval F. who will supplies to make Mexican antojitos for her prepared food business; Sra. Maria Isabel B. B. who will buy women's clothing to resell; Sra. Francisca B. Cortes who will buy chemical and organic fertilizers for her farming business; and Sra. Aurelia P. A. who will buy stock for her grocery business and supplies for her wholesale fruit and nut business.\r\nTo Kiva and Fundacion Realidad, the members say \"We are very grateful that you have trusted us and we will fulfill the terms of the loan so that you will continue to loan to us.  We thank you because you don't know us and you support us anyway\".<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1850,"image":{"id":578907,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Working capital for multiple businesses.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"HUEYAPAN MORELOS","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2010-08-06T18:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1850,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marcela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dominga ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Isabel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francisca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aurelia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":23000,"loan_amount":1850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1437.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1437.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1437.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1437.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1437.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1437.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1437.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1437.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1437.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1437.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1437.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1437.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1437.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1437.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1437.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1437.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.63},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.62},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.63},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.62},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.62},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.63},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.62},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.63},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.62},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":115.63},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":115.62},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":115.63},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":115.62},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":115.63},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":115.62},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":115.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":462.5,"local_amount":5750,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:21:27Z","rounded_local_amount":5822.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166854280,"comment":null},{"amount":580.1,"local_amount":7212.1,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-20T08:27:03Z","rounded_local_amount":7303.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172121177,"comment":null},{"amount":113.65,"local_amount":1412.9,"processed_date":"2010-10-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:25:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1430.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177415282,"comment":null},{"amount":115.62,"local_amount":1437.5,"processed_date":"2010-10-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:25:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1455.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177415283,"comment":null},{"amount":115.63,"local_amount":1437.5,"processed_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:26:12Z","rounded_local_amount":1455.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177415284,"comment":null},{"amount":115.62,"local_amount":1437.5,"processed_date":"2010-10-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:26:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1455.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177415285,"comment":null},{"amount":346.88,"local_amount":4312.5,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:16:23Z","rounded_local_amount":4367.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182554932,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-08-13T16:51:58Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T14:16:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":220462,"name":"God\u2019S Blessing #2.

She started this work when her life partner was unemployed for a few months.  She needed to continue to support her family so, as any good mother would do, Marcela worked hard to provide for her children.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning her sales were poor because she was selling her items just to acquaintances.  Gradually, however, she began to get more customers through her friends.  Currently, her items such as sweaters, vests, caps and placemats are exported to Spain by some of her regular customers; this is of great help to her in being able to meet household expenses.  She comments that on weekends she also engages in farming.\r\n\r\nShe used her first loan to buy wool she needed to make sweaters for children and adults.

In the meantime, she plans to continue enjoying being at home, relaxing.\r\n\r\nIvelisse is excited to be taking out her 8th loan with Esperanza after having successfully repaid her previous loan and grown her business. She has had her business for almost 4 years,  and she started it with her first loan in Esperanza. She plans to use this loan to invest in her business by buying clothing like pants (specially jeans), shirts, and some shoes. She will use the profit to invest in more clothes and to add more products, also she needs to buy various things for her home.\r\n \r\nThis Esperanza associate began with us because she wanted to have a business and her  story is representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican clients generally, many of whom recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti. Her group is located in the rural area surrounding Hato Mayor, an area where the economy is dominated by agriculture. This area, like nearly all impoverished areas of the Dominican Republic suffers from unreliable  electricity and running water (none of which is

Her group is located in San Pedro D. Macoris, a city famous for baseball players and sugar cane industries. The main economic activities are a free traD. zone, a cement factory, and others.

She lives with her partner and their five school-aged children. Together, they live in the town of Santa Rosa, located in the beautiful rain forest of the Ayacucho area. They have their own house made of wood. Previously, Mercedes worked as a farmer, but for reasons of fate, she decided to take on a new project together with her partner: making all types of furniture. Since her partner knows a wide range of models and modern designs, he has an advantage, and this business provides Mercedes with much more satisfaction than her previous work. Previously, they had to wait for the harvest, and even then, it did not provide good profits. Her daily routine starts at 7:00 in the morning and continues until 8:00 at night. Her sales area is on the first floor of her house. Her plans for the future are to expand the carpentry shop, due to the need to store inventory and add more machinery. This will help them minimize time and costs. This is her eighth loan with MFP, and she is committed to continue making her payments on time. She is also satisfied with her communal bank, thanks to the advantages it offers. With the loan she is requesting, she is thinking about investing in buying wood, such as tornillo, mahogany and cedar, with the aim of fulfilling her delivery commitments for her most demanding customers. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":579553,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture Making","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"Buying various types of wood","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-08-06T21:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mercedes ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1075}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1075,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:41:26Z","rounded_local_amount":3021.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191463067,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-08-07T14:16:35Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T04:41:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":220514,"name":"Michael","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Michael, de 25 a\u00f1os de edad, convive son su pareja y tienen una hija.

It is located in the beautiful Ayacuchan jungle, where he has an adobe house.\r\n\r\nLife for Michael was difficult, and it was much more difficult when he graduated from the university as a mining engineer.  He was unable to find steady work, and he made due with small seasonal jobs.  It stayed that way for several years until he had the opportunity to work as a building contractor for homes and buildings.\r\n\r\nHe now provides diverse services for public and private entities.  Therefore, it is going very well for him.  Also, he has a group of workmen for whatever work that presents itself.  Now his financial situation has improved.  He does his work locally.\r\n\r\nHis plan for the future is to have his own construction company.  The reason for this is to be able to improve his finances and his quality of life.\r\n\r\nThis is his fifth loan with MFP.  He pledges to continue making his payments on time.  Also, he is pleased with his communal bank because everyone helps each other.\r\n\r\nHe will use the requested loan to buy construction materials like surveying equipment, pickaxes, shovels, and nail pullers.  He will do that to minimize time and cost. \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":579556,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction","sector":"Construction","use":"Buy construction materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-08-06T23:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Michael ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1075}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1075,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:41:49Z","rounded_local_amount":3021.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191463068,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-08-09T18:58:14Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T04:41:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":220515,"name":"Modesto","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or es casado, vive en el barrio San Miguel de la ciudad de Pilar, su se\u00f1ora es ama de casa, es empleada del estado.\nPosee casa propia, con las comodidades dentro del bienestar familiar, posee m\u00f3vil de transporte propio, camioneta, moto.\nEl mismo es comerciante, tambi\u00e9n cuenta con una  empresa de servicios que realiza la actividad de ventas de servicios de comidas.\nSolicita el cr\u00e9dito para compras de insumos para su negocio como: harina, fideos, az\u00facar, l\u00e1cteos, panificados, aceites y otros.\nCuenta con una antig\u00fcedad en el ramo m\u00e1s de 10 a\u00f1os.\nAgradece tambi\u00e9n a la Organizaci\u00f3n por los buenos servicios que le brinda la instituci\u00f3n para su empresa comercial y de servicios.","en":"The gentleman is married, lives in the city of Pilar\u2019s San Miguel neighborhood, is a state employee and his wife\u2019s a housewife.
