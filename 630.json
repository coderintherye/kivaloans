In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals in the evening, when all of the family members are at home to partake of the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food on one or two people, when buying prepared rice and viands costs less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 1,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a 30,000-PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more products like meat, rice, vegetables, condiments, and seasonings. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nYolanda dreams of being able to give all her children a high-quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her fellowship co-members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n * All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She also sells from a stall that she rents in a very busy area.  Elva started out in business many years ago selling clothes.  She then worked running a radio taxi business and now she has started selling sneakers for adults and babies.  Her business is going very well and, with a lot of effort, she has managed to consolidate her capital. \r\n\r\nElva is requesting a loan as she needs to increase her capital by purchasing sneakers wholesale for the coming months which is when she makes most income.  Elva lives in her husband's home together with her children who are in school.  She has been a client of our institution since 2006.  She used to work as a member of a community bank but, because of the limited time that she had, she preferred to switch to taking out individual loans.  Over the years, Elva has demonstrated responsibility and punctuality in making her loan

is 35 years old and lives in the city of Otavalo, Ecuador. She is married and lives with her husband and two children who are 10 and 4 years old, respectively. Nancy is an entrepreneurial person who works day-to-day for the well-being of her family. She is a seamstress who dedicates her time to creating embroidered blouses that are popular with the indigenous community in the region. Nancy is obtaining a loan to purchase four rolls of material to make these blouses. She began her business with a single sewing machine six years ago. Now she works with two sewing machines and two machines that do embroidery. She currently works with two other seamstresses.

The contracts that he gets with the group are weekly and he can always get work as a musician paid by the hour. But William's greatest dream is to have his own musical group and to learn more. What he knows about music he learnt from some friends who taught him to play, but he wants to have a deeper understanding of music. At the same time, he sells animals in the livestock market in his area, drawing on everything that his parents taught him about this work, and he has projects to increase his working capital. He was invited to be part of the community bank by a relative and he promises to make his monthly repayments punctually because he has future investments clearly in mind. He will use the loan to buy sheep to sell and also part of it for maintaining his musical instrument.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":811391,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy sheep.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-07-15T12:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"William ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":600,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":225,"local_amount":600,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:32:31Z","rounded_local_amount":617.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263385392,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-07-15T16:50:19Z","paid_date":"2012-03-15T10:32:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":315738,"name":"G.s.

There she sells household products and also clothes and cosmetics.  Her current assets are represented in her stock which has a turnover period of 11 days.  As she recovers her accounts receivable slowly, she is not able to meet her orders.  This means that, although she maintains a good profitability, she does not have enough working capital to meet the needs and interests of her growing customer base.  For this reason, she is requesting a Kiva loan which will be her first loan through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She will use it to buy clothes and household products in larger quantities so that she can not only respond to orders from her potential buyers but also obtain good discounts which will allow her to sell at competitive prices.\r\n\r\nNancy lives with her family: her husband and her two children, aged 10 and 18, who are studying and for whom she has many goals.  She would like them to become professionals but mainly she would like them to become honest and upstanding citizens.  For this reason, when she started her business five years ago, she did it with the goal of supporting her family's growth and development.

She is a single and hard-working woman who lives with her mom and dad who she loves and cares for in their own home which is located in the small village of Cumutay.\r\n\r\nElizabeth has been farming since she was 20 years old.  Her main crops are potatoes and peas.  What she most enjoys about her work is being able to care for her calf while she is getting rid of the weeds that grow amongst her crops.  What she doesn't enjoy are the seasons when farmers harvest a large quantity of vegetables as they flood the market and don't allow her to make good profits.  However, during such seasons she leaves her peas to dry and turns them into seeds.  She then sells the sacks of seeds for a better price in the central market in Tarma.  This allows her to stabilize her finances.  In addition, Elizabeth also spends her spare time teaching children under the age of 5.  She tells us that, as a young woman, her community bank plays a dominant role in her life since it helps her to grow and forge new goals.  Elizabeth is planning to open a restaurant in her area as there isn't one right now.\r\n\r\nElizabeth is a member of the 'Pioneros de Cumutay' (Cumutay Pioneers) community bank and this is her ninth loan from MFP.

He works to support his family by selling footwear at a busy central market called \u201cPanjshanbeh\u201d. Abdumalik has been in business for about eight years and makes around $200-$300 per month. Eventually he would like to open a second vending location to increase his sales and profits. Abdumalik has requested a loan of $1,500 USD to add to his working business capital. He has developed a good reputation and credit history with IMON International. We look forward to many more opportunities to assist Abdumalik with the success of his business. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

is very hardworking woman who tries to make money for her family by working hard everyday. About six years ago, she decided to start raising and selling animals. This allows her to pay for the education of her three children, who have high hopes for the future. She raises young cattle and later sells them at the markets. She prepares them to be ready to eat for the eating pleasure of the people in her country. Since Onabibi aspires for a great future, she decided to expand her businesses with the sole purpose of improving her family's living conditions and to help pay for her children's education so that they can one day become good citizens in society. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International: Tajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History: Since December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
