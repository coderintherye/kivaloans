O. is from the town of Aloran.

The main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Erlinda has been engaged in her business for over six years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2005, Erlinda joined PMPC to gain access to financial services. She hoped to help improve her living situation and to increase her ability to engage in business activities. Erlinda has successfully repaid a previous loan from PMPC. Erlinda is requesting a new loan of 14,900 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the sixteenth loan taken out by Erlinda from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout PMPC: \r\n<p>\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

R. is from the village of Barangay 3, Tangub City, Misamis Occidental.

To make a living, Constancia makes & sells \"poso\" or \"hanging rice.\" Constancia has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2008, Constancia joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services. Her hope was to help improve her living situation and to increase her ability to engage in business activities. Constancia has successfully repaid a previous loan from GDMPC and is now requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make her food products for sale. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Constancia from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n<p>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolk, and small entrepreneurs.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

P. is from the village of Sumirap, Tangub City, Misamis Occidental. She is 35 years old. Grace is married and has 1 adult-aged child. To make a living, Grace works in someone else's business venture in the food sector making & selling food. The main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling breads, cakes and cookies to the local community. Grace has been engaged in her business for over 2 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Grace joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Grace is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to invest in a business. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Grace from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Antoniette has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 2,000 PHP a month.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2009, Antoniette joined Kiva partner GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Antoniette is requesting a loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Antoniette from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n<p>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

E. is from the village of Sta. Cruz, Tangub City, M.isamis Occidental.  She is 59-years old. Teresita is married and has three adult children. To make a living, Teresita owns and operates a business raising crops. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from planting and harvesting peanuts for sale. Teresita has been engaged in her business for over ten years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2009, Teresita joined Kiva partner GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Teresita is requesting a loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Teresita from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n<p>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fishers and small entrepreneurs.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

S. was born in the Inhambane province of the Vilanculos district (790 km north of Maputo). She is married and is the mother of 2 children between the ages of 21 and 24. Her first son works in a business in Boane while the other studies. She stopped her studies in the 5th grade because her parents did not believe in the value of education. <p\/>\r\n<p\/>\r\n\r\nShe has lived in Boane more than 10 years, having come from Maputo, where she moved with her whole family, in her own home with her mother, whom she supports. Her husband works in the Cimentos de Mo\u00e7ambique (Cements of Mozambique) factory while she has run the business for the last 12 months without employees. <p\/> \r\n<p\/>\r\nShe learned how to run the business during her 24 years in the Fajardo market in the city of Maputo. She sells grains (corn which she buys at 120,00 MT per sack and sells for 255,00 MT per sack). They bring in a daily revenue of 2.500,00MT and she saves the money in a traditional rotating method (called an xitique). <p\/>\r\n\r\n<p\/>\r\nShe has never taken out a loan with any other bank. She learned of Hluvuku-Adsema (a Kiva partner) through her neighbors and has been given 3 loans (10.000,00MT; 20.000,00MT and 30.000,00MT), all for her business.<p\/>\r\n<p\/>\r\nWith this loan of 15.000,00MT she hopes to buy more products (corn and other grains) to fortify her business. She decided to ask for a smaller loan than before because of the saturation of the market. <p\/>\r\n<p\/>\r\nShe plans to pay without problems so that she can take out more loans with the objective of expanding into new areas and to hire workers to help with marketing.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Michelle Harrison, Kiva

He is 38 years old, married, and is the father of 2 children who are 9 and 13 and both attend school. Aside from his own family, he also supports 3 nephews. He studied until the 6th grade but had to stop because of the war. He lives with his family in his own home.  <p\/>\r\n<p\/>\r\nGeraldo left Zavala for Maputo with his family when he was 16 to take refuge from the civil war that ended in 1992. He arrived in Maputo and worked with his cousin as a driver for a tram for 10 years. Later on he found a job with the gas station Petromoc (Petroleum of Mozambique) where he continues to work today. \r\n\r\n<p\/><p\/>\r\n\r\nAside from this work and as his monthly salary is 5.000,00MT, with which he supports his family, he has a business selling tires. He buys the tires at 1.350,00MT and sells them for 1.950,00MT and he earns a good return which he saves in the bank. \r\n<p\/><p\/>\r\nHe has never taken out a loan with another bank and this is his 4th loan with Hluvuku-Adsema in the amount of 15.000,00MT to buy and sell the tires and other accessories. He learned of the institution through his friends and neighbors who are also clients. The first loans he took were used for the same purpose and were for the amounts of 7.500,00MT, 15.000,00MT, and 25.000,00MT, respectively. \r\n\r\n<p\/><p\/>\r\n\r\nHe plans to pay back the loans without problems to be able to have access to more loans to finance his dream of improving his services, constructing a conventional establishment, including a car wash. \r\n\r\n<br

He studied until the 4th grade but he stopped his studies due to political factors during the Portuguese colonial rule. He lives with his family and two granddaughters and two nephews whom he cares for in his own home in the Boane district. \r\n<p\/>\r\n<p\/>\r\nChapo participated in the independence movement against the colonial Portuguese regime, beginning in 1954 and which ended in 1975 under the leadership of the party then in power in Mozambique. In 1994 after the first general elections of the country, reform came. <p\/>\r\n<p\/>\r\nHe earns 3.500,00MT monthly in the national defense ministry. Aside from this, he receives 3.000,00MT for the lease of a house that he constructed with money obtained after the end of his military service. <p\/>\r\n<p\/>\r\nHe never has taken a loan with another bank. He came to know Hluvuku-Adsema through his neighborhood secretary having taken a loan for 16.000,00MT which he used to buy construction materials. <p\/>\r\n<p\/>\r\nWith this new loan of 20.000,00MT he hopes to continue the construction of more than one house to rent, purchasing  construction materials. He hopes to pay back the loan without problems in order to be able to have access to future loans for the same purpose. After finishing his current project, he dreams of buying a vehicle for his children. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Michelle Harrison, Kiva

She is 36 years old and is the mother of one son, 13 years old, who studies in the elementary school of Boane.  She studied until seventh grade, having had to stop due to social and traditional issues.\r\n\r\nLizete grew up with her parents and never left the district.  She is a widow at this time.  She learned how to do business a long time ago with her mother, and she sells new and used clothing for adults and children in the central market of Boane.  Her business is evolving well.  She acquires merchandise in the city of Maputo at 1,500 MT for a bundle of mixed clothing, and sells at 3,000 MT per bundle.  This yields 3,000 MT each month, which is applied to reinforcing her business and sustaining her family.  She puts money aside in a traditional savings system (xitique) once a week.\r\n\r\nShe has already had loans with other similar institutions as part of a group, and when she got information through neighbours about the individual loans from Hluvuku-Adsema, she approached and asked for various loans for the same purpose of selling used clothing, one of 6,000 MT and the rest for 10,000 MT each.\r\n\r\nShe has already benefitted from a loan from Kiva, and paid it back without problems.  Her business has realised a significant improvement.  She lives and manages to support her family.\r\n\r\nWith the present loan of 15,000 MT, she plans to purchase bundles of used clothing and others of new clothing in response to the demand for this product.  She proposes to pay back the loan without problems in order to access more loans with the goal of constructing a chicken coop to raise poultry.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Heidi Petersen, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":547.27,"image":{"id":370095,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"Purchase and sale of various clothing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Boane, Maputo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-26.041667 32.325278","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":"2009-08-24T02:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":27.73,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lizete Venancio","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":15000,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":659.14},{"due_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":688.93},{"due_date":"2009-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":720.08},{"due_date":"2009-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":752.63},{"due_date":"2009-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":786.65},{"due_date":"2010-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":822.21},{"due_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":859.38},{"due_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":898.23},{"due_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":938.84},{"due_date":"2010-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":981.28},{"due_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1025.64},{"due_date":"2010-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1072},{"due_date":"2010-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1120.46},{"due_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1171.11},{"due_date":"2010-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1224.05},{"due_date":"2010-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1279.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.27},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.41},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.6},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.85},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.15},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.52},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.95},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.43},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.99},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.61},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.32},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.09},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.95},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.9},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.92},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.04}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":25.27,"local_amount":659.14,"processed_date":"2009-08-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T16:51:37Z","rounded_local_amount":670.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73618999,"comment":null},{"amount":27.14,"local_amount":707.98,"processed_date":"2009-09-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T19:52:26Z","rounded_local_amount":720.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87056838,"comment":null},{"amount":161.22,"local_amount":4205.8,"processed_date":"2009-10-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T23:28:57Z","rounded_local_amount":4280.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96971794,"comment":null},{"amount":63.16,"local_amount":1647.69,"processed_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T14:24:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1676.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110708915,"comment":null},{"amount":79.66,"local_amount":2078,"processed_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-18T08:18:08Z","rounded_local_amount":2114.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123937928,"comment":null},{"amount":0.01,"local_amount":0.39,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-24T07:49:01Z","rounded_local_amount":0.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123937929,"comment":null},{"amount":67.94,"local_amount":1958.36,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-17T07:51:58Z","rounded_local_amount":1992.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.13,"payment_id":128971929,"comment":null},{"amount":122.87,"local_amount":3742.64,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-09T07:47:41Z","rounded_local_amount":3808.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":20.6,"payment_id":159878416,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-08-24T06:19:16Z","paid_date":"2010-10-09T07:47:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":129250,"name":"Help Us Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Here are Fatmata B., Yeabu W., Hawa S., Hawa S. and Jeneba S..

Vive com a fam\u00edlia na sua pr\u00f3pria casa.\n\nArmindo saiu de Inhembane em 1988 para Maputo e cinco anos depois saiu da cidade de Maputo para boane, onde vive ate data hoje com a sua esposa, seus filhos e sobrinhos. Chegado ao distrito, no ano de 1993, iniciou o negocio de venda de material de constru\u00e7\u00e3o localmente dispon\u00edvel (capim) com experi\u00eancia a mais de 3 anos vendendo este tipo de material.

He is married and is the father of three children whose ages average 10 years, all of whom attend school.  In addition to supporting his family, he has two dependent nephews.  He studied until fifth grade, having had to stop school due to his economic and social situation.  He lives with his family in his own house.\r\n\r\nArmindo left Inhembane in 1988 for Maputo, and five years later left the city of Maputo for Boane, where he still lives today with his wife, his children and his nephews.  Having arrived in the area in 1993, he began a business selling locally available construction material (capim - a type of grass), having more than three years of experience selling this type of material.  A sheaf of capim sells for 4,003 MT.  It's very difficult to acquire this material at times, because the capim dries out.\r\n\r\nThe business yields 4,000 MT, with which he manages to support his family and save some money through a traditional savings system (xitique).  This is his second loan with Hluvuku in the amount of 12,000 MT to purchase construction materials for cabins and other types of tourist complexes.  The first loan was for 15,000 MT, also for the same purpose.  \r\n\r\nHe got to know Hluvuku through a friend who is also a client of the institution.  He has never had a loan with another institution, and with the present loan he plans to acquire more raw materials and to be able to employ more people to help in the collection or procurement of material.\r\n\r\nArmindo proposes to pay back the loan as quickly as possible, without problems, in order to be able to obtain other loans for the purpose of constructing an oven for manufacturing bread.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Heidi Petersen, Kiva

She is a single mother of three children, all of whom are adults and live in their own homes.  She studied until sixth grade under the old system, and lives in her own house with a dependent grandson in the neighbourhood of Matola 700.\r\n\r\nAlbertina grew up with her parents and had the opportunity to learn various trades, amongst which hairdressing was the one she most enjoyed doing.  She has an establishment made of conventional materials \u2013 a hairdressing salon \u2013 where she works providing beauty services.\r\n\r\nShe has 30 years of experience in this activity and runs her business without great difficulty, in part because she acquires beauty products at a good price, and has had customers that guarantee her stability for her business.  This yields 350 MT per day, and at the end of every month she is able to pay her loan and support her family.\r\n\r\nShe has never had bank loans with other institutions, and came to learn about the existence of Hluvuku-Adsema through her oldest daughter.  She has already taken out two loans, for 6,000 MT and 8,500 MT respectively, for carrying out the activities of her hairdressing salon.\r\n\r\nWith the loan of 10,000 MT, she plans to purchase construction materials to increase the size of her establishment (hairdressing salon) to provide quality services to her customers.  She has challenged herself to enlarge the installation and expand her business.\r\n\r\nShe proposes to pay back the loan without problems in order to access more loans, with the objective of growing her business and improving the social situation of her family.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Heidi Petersen, Kiva

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients present a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Bakhtiyor is a 24-year old man. He is married with two small children. Bakhtiyor\u2019s goals are to grow in his personal life and in his business. His wish is to offer better service to his customers. He is a taxi driver and travels the streets of Spitamen in search of customers. He has owned his business for five years. He also raises cattle at his house with the support of his wife.  Bakhtiyor is asking for a loan of $ 800 US in order to replace the fuel supply system in his taxi with one using gas, as gas is cheaper than petrol. He sincerely thanks Kiva and all lenders that make such help possible.    \n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients present a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Shahnoza is 22-years old, married and the loving mother of three children. She works purchasing and reselling cows with her husband. She would like to request a loan of $800 USD in order to purchase additional cows to increase her inventory and meet customer demands. Shahnoza believes this will lead to greater revenue and, ultimately, greater profit for her family. In the future, she would like to reinvest the earnings generated by this loan back into her business in order to purchase additional cows and increase their income further. You could become an important part of Shahnoza family's life and she deeply appreciates the trust and support you are giving her.   \r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

These board members came to SMT\/Kiva to seek a loan of Le 7,000,000 after several unsuccessful attempts from other NGOs within and outside of Makeni town. They have planted a rice farm of 120 acres of land in a village called Rulakoh, about seven miles from Makeni, but are currently in need of labor to help them in the weeding, bird scareing and harvesting. Thus with the Le 7,000,000.00, they will be able to achieve this. \r\n\r\nCSAC is a community based organization registered in 2004 to help ensure the well being of the disabled and their children in the Bombali district. The organization has a membership of 1000 disabled drawn from four different categories of the disabled: leprosy victims, polio victims, amputees and the blind. CSAC carries out agricultural activities and provides free schooling for the children of the disabled.\r\n\r\nAlimany Edward K. is the founder of this organization. He has lived in New York for over twenty-four years but had never seen the disabled begging for a living. But back home in Sierra Leone, the disabled, together with their children, go out begging for a living. This was appalling to Alimany, especially so for the children who were not handicapped. Without any form of empowerment for these children, their plight will be miserable in the future once their parents have passed away \u2013 begging will no longer help them since they are not in any way handicapped. Thus Alimany K. decided to form this organization to help the handicapped by engaging them in agriculture and setting up of a school for their children. \r\n\r\nSo far, CSAC has been able to give education to over 200 children of the disabled. They also give medical and feeding assistance to the most vulnerable of the disabled. However, their two main challenges are 1) labor vacuum \u2013 because of their disabilities, they can not work efficiently on the farm and 2) inadequate funds to ensure proper implementation of their programs. However, with this loan, SMT\/Kiva will salvage the issue of labor vacuum.\r\n\r\nJames S. K. (left), a non-disabled himself, is currently acting as Director of the Organization. He was born in Makeni forty-nine years ago. He is married with two children.

This group has already received Kiva loans that it repaid correctly.  Modeste has a commercial business making artisanal soaps, which he sells.  He has a telephone booth as well.  His businesses are located in the most populated outlying district of Kinshasa and north of the city.  \r\n\r\nTo realize his ambition of opening a factory for making soaps to provide to retailers, Modeste works hard while reinvesting his accumulated profits.  Also, he is counting on Kiva loans through the micro-finance institution Hope RDC.  He has already received three of them, which he totally repaid.  The next loan will be used to buy goods for making soaps to sell, with the aim of growing his profits.  Currently, his businesses generate a profit of $45 a week for him. \r\n\r\nModeste is 54 years old, married, and the father of six children, ages 12 to 30.  All of them go to school. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva

Their primary activity is handicrafts, agriculture, and a little livestock.\r\n\r\nMargarita is married and has four children.  Margarita has been weaving since she was a very little girl.  This ability generates some income.  She sends her weavings to be sold in the capital every time that someone she knows goes there.  Margarita needs a loan for 200 PEN to buy raw material to continue with her weavings.  She would like to have her own weaving machine.\r\n\r\nAurelia is married and has six children.  Aurelia, like most of the women in the community, also weaves.  But, she also has a small grocery store.  Little by little, the store is growing thanks to the investment she is making in it.  Aurelia needs a loan for 200 PEN to stock her store with products that are in greater demand.\r\n\r\nJuana is married and has 3 children.  Juana sells food in the fairs.  She also weaves small articles of clothing, which she sends to Lima to sell.

She took out her first microloan a year and a half ago, and is beginning her fourth loan cycle with Esperanza.\r\n<p>\r\nA smart businesswoman, Juana seeks out the best prices for clothing from cities all across the northwestern part of the Dominican Republic \u2013 she even travels to the border with Haiti to buy less expensive clothing in order to help garner a profit.  She is so well known in her neighborhood that she no longer has to go door to door to sell clothing.  Before she goes to Santiago or another location to purchase her inventory, individuals come to her home and request a customized list, and Juana is more than happy to find exactly what they want.\r\n<p>\r\nCurrently living with just her husband, Juana has seen all three of her children (two daughters and one son), not only get married, but also pursue college education.  With her business, Juana has been able to support her children\u2019s education. One wishes to be a nurse and another studies English.  Smiling, she adds (as any mom with college-age students might say), \u201cNow they have to pay the university on their own! When you\u2019re married, you pay for your own stuff.\u201d\r\n<p>\r\nIn the future, Juana wishes to have her own store where she can sell her clothing.

There, they have business activities such as storekeeping, dual purpose cattle farming (meat and dairy), and agriculture.\r\n<p>\r\nRuth has been involved in dual purpose cattle farming for several years now.  She is able to sell her products to neighbors in her community, who are very satisfied with the quality of the products that she offers.\r\n<p>\r\nRuth thinks that thanks to the progress of this project, she and her family have improved, little by little, their quality of life and that she has been able to be a participant in the development of the community.  She also comments that since the beginning of the business, her self-esteem has increased greatly and now she feels very capable.\r\n<p>\r\nRight now, Ruth would like a loan of 650,000 CRC to purchase 6 male calves so that she can increase her production.  She knows that having more cows is a bigger sacrifice and will require more work.  However, her desire to have a successful small business and help her family get ahead and improve their living conditions motivates her to work with great care and dedication.\r\n<p>\r\nRuth is a member of the Empresa de Cr\u00e9dito Comunal Bansuperafe, which consists of only women.  It specializes in supporting women who are not professionals or the head of household.  It is one of EDESA\u2019s 100 partner organizations in Costa Rica.  This will be Ruth\u2019s fourth loan and with it, she hopes to continue growing on a personal and economic level, in addition to actively participating in the loan organization in her community.<br

(second from left) is a hardworking mother of three who sells used clothing to make a living.  She sells what is called \u201cropa de paca,\" which is pre-made bundles of used clothing from the United States and other countries, organized into bags such as men\u2019s clothing, women\u2019s clothing and bedsheets.  Juana travels to cities up to five hours away from her home in Saman\u00e1 to purchase the clothing she sells to those in her neighborhood.\r\n<p>\r\nTeresa works from her home, where she lives with her husband and three children, ages 14, 10 and 4.  Her customers drop by with orders and requests, and Teresa happily finds the necessary clothing when she purchases inventory.  Currently on her eighth loan with Esperanza International, Teresa has proven to be a determined and responsible businesswoman.  Recognizing the oversaturation of some other types of businesses, she decided to enter into clothing sales, where she has found sales to be brisk.\r\n<p>\r\nMany of Teresa\u2019s profits go to feeding her children.  With five people living at home, her husband\u2019s salary as a boat driver is not sufficient to provide everything necessary for the family.  Now, with Teresa augmenting the family\u2019s income, all are comfortably fed and clothed.\r\n<p>\r\nIn the future, Teresa dreams of having her own store from which she can sell her clothing and other goods.  As well, when her children reach college age, she hopes to support their education at a local university.\r\n<p>\r\nThank you for your Kiva loan to Teresa and the other members of her

She is 48 years old.  She lives with her husband, Efrain, who is 46 years old.  She also lives with her sons 16 year old Joaquin, 15 year old Saul, and her elderly mother of 79 years in her own house.  For 2 years she has woven fabric, which she sells at request.  She chose this business because it is an activity which she can do from her home and at the same time take care of her family.  Ada likes her work a lot as she can obtain an extra income and it is a past time she has had since she was young. In addition, she has other businesses: the taxi which her husband drives daily and her services as the nurse for an elderly woman on the weekends. She has taken technical studies in nursing.  Ada is happy because she can generate earnings for the well-being of her family.  In the near future they want to buy another car so that they can form a fleet of taxis.  This is her third loan with a solidarity group in MFP (Microfinanzas PRISMA), and it has gone very well for her because she is with good and responsible partners.  With the money she asks for, she wants to buy more yarn to create her cloth and also repair her husband\u2019s car.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Molly Trad, Kiva

The region is dedicated to commerce, cattle-raising (for both meat and milk) and agriculture. \r\n<p>\r\nRecently, Carolina was separated from her husband and since her two children are small, she wished to start a micro-enterprise, installing a small restaurant serving local dishes in her own home. She says that in this manner she could help with household expenses and she would not have to go out of the house, leaving her children.  In the past, she has worked in restaurants large and small, giving her sufficient experience.  Also, she has seen that it is a very good business and that it would be well received in her community.\r\n<p>\r\nShe needs to borrow $1,175 to buy merchandise to sell, plus a refrigerator, a deep fat fryer, and a blender, among other utensils necessary to start her business.  This would enable her to provide good service to her neighbors.\r\n<p>\r\nCarolina belongs to La Esperanza Womens Community Credit organization, which helps women who are non-professionals or heads of households.  It is one of 100 organizations associated with EDESA in Costa Rica.  This will be her first loan. With it she hopes to continue her personal and economic development and to participate actively in the credit organization in her community.          \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by

She sells on a road side in the community where she lives. Her food production is on a low scale because of inadequate funds to support her business. She wants to use the loan to buy more meat, vegetables, and bags of rice to increase her efficiency to produce in larger quantities. She believes this will help expand her business to raise more income to support her business growth and the children's education.

She normally concentrates on selling kid\u2019s wear, bed sheets and used towels.\r\n\r\nAgatha believes this loan will help her save for her children\u2019s future and also help her to rent a store to trade in as she currently sells the clothing through hawking (going door-to-door).\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":370293,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"To buy more bales of used clothing and bags of charcoal to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GH","country":"Ghana","town":"Dunkwa","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"8 -2","type":"point"}},"partner_id":88,"posted_date":"2009-08-16T00:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Agatha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GHS","disbursal_amount":800,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":88.89},{"due_date":"2009-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":88.89},{"due_date":"2009-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":88.89},{"due_date":"2009-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":88.89},{"due_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":88.89},{"due_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":88.89},{"due_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":88.89},{"due_date":"2010-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":88.89},{"due_date":"2010-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":88.88}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.11},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.11},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.12},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.11},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.11},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.11},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.11},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.12},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.1}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":61.11,"local_amount":88.89,"processed_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T03:37:46Z","rounded_local_amount":89.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87109473,"comment":null},{"amount":61.11,"local_amount":88.89,"processed_date":"2009-10-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:56:04Z","rounded_local_amount":89.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97025627,"comment":null},{"amount":61.12,"local_amount":88.89,"processed_date":"2009-11-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:51:15Z","rounded_local_amount":89.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103870170,"comment":null},{"amount":61.11,"local_amount":88.89,"processed_date":"2009-12-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:56:17Z","rounded_local_amount":89.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110759487,"comment":null},{"amount":61.11,"local_amount":88.89,"processed_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-04T09:22:47Z","rounded_local_amount":89.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118148192,"comment":null},{"amount":61.11,"local_amount":88.89,"processed_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-26T07:59:06Z","rounded_local_amount":89.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123986328,"comment":null},{"amount":61.11,"local_amount":88.89,"processed_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-18T08:26:53Z","rounded_local_amount":89.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129017151,"comment":null},{"amount":61.12,"local_amount":88.89,"processed_date":"2010-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-20T08:21:35Z","rounded_local_amount":89.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136742214,"comment":null},{"amount":61.1,"local_amount":88.88,"processed_date":"2010-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:02:12Z","rounded_local_amount":89.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144775138,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-08-16T13:11:01Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T10:02:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":129369,"name":"Bolivar Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El grupo \u201cBolivar\u201d estan representadas por la se\u00f1ora Rosa y conformadas por 12 miembros que en su mayor\u00eda se dedican al comercio de productos como de ropa para todos los gusto y un porcentaje m\u00ednimo de las socias se dedican a la venta de abarrotes, pan y a la elaboraci\u00f3n de prendas de vestir.

sells meals every evening from her front porch, putting out four tables beginning around 6:00 pm. She offers her customers fried chicken, hot dogs, french fries, hamburgers, and soft drinks. She has an excellent location for her business, near the corner of a main road, and has a good customer base.\r\n\r\nElizabeth has been working with Manuela Ramos, a Kiva field partner, for two years and is a member of the \"Amigas Por Siempre\" (Friends Forever) communal bank . Elizabeth invested her first loan of 300 soles (about $100) in ingredients for cakes and other baked goods, which she sold at her father\u2019s bakery. Although she was able to earn additional income by working at her father\u2019s bakery, Elizabeth wanted to have her own independent business, so she decided to start her little home-based restaurant. Her business has been going quite well. \r\n\r\nElizabeth used her last loan of 1500 soles (about $500) from Manuela Ramos to purchase a special fryer for chicken. Elizabeth plans to use this loan of 2000 soles to purchase six more tables, better chairs, and food in bulk. Elizabeth\u2019s business has grown a lot. On weekends, she now has more customers than she can accommodate at the four tables she has in her restaurant. \r\n\r\nElizabeth lives with her partner and their two children, ages 13 and 7. Her partner works as a supervisor at a company that repairs broken phone lines and downed phone systems. \r\n\r\nElizabeth is glad to be working with Manuela Ramos. She was unable to get loans from other banks because they had too many requirements. Elizabeth also appreciates the educational talks given by Manuela Ramos\u2019s loan officers at every monthly meeting of her communal bank. These talks deal with business-related themes (e.g. how to promote and develop a business) as well as larger themes, such as making life goals, etc. \r\n\r\nElizabeth \"thinks big\" about her business and has many goals for the future. Eventually, she wants to buy an extra-large deep fryer for making french fries. She also wants to turn the front room of her home into a restaurant so she will have a larger and more comfortable space for her customers.\r\n\r\nIn this short video clip, Elizabeth talks about how she wants to expand and improve her business, and how she plans to take full advantage of her loans in order to do so."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":369019,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":957,"youtube_id":"lMkloCHHPfY"},"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"Higher-quality chairs, six tables, food in bulk for a restaurant business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Pucallpa-Ucayali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2009-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2009-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2010-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":400}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":140},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":140},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":140},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":140}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":140,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2009-09-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T22:39:30Z","rounded_local_amount":410.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87074783,"comment":null},{"amount":140,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2009-10-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T01:54:19Z","rounded_local_amount":410.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96990138,"comment":null},{"amount":140,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:38:47Z","rounded_local_amount":410.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103835039,"comment":null},{"amount":140,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2009-12-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:05:50Z","rounded_local_amount":410.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110726886,"comment":null},{"amount":140,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2010-01-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:05:26Z","rounded_local_amount":410.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118117459,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-09-04T16:19:24Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T12:05:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":129380,"name":"Lourdes","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Lourdes que en estos momentos cuenta con 31 a\u00f1os vive en  su propia casa, ubicada en la Urb.

G. is 41 and lives with his wife and three daughters in a community called Sa\u00edno de Pital, which is located in the provice of Alajuela.  The main economic activities here are livestock and agriculture, most notably the production of pineapple.  The pineapple is mainly sold to international markets.  For this reason, the development of the community has grown in recent years, generating a larger demand for products and services, which help to mitigate the effect of immigration.  \r\n\r\nSince he was very young, Clover has been dedicated to growing pineapple, so he has quite a bit of experience in caring for and maintaining this type of crop.  He has a small amount of land where he has grown pineapple before, and it has given him good results when it comes time to sell it, which is why he wants to expand his crop.  Thanks to this business, the quality of life of his family has improved considerably.  Clober is requesting a loan of 585,000 colones to purchase pineapple startes and various supplies to give the best maintenance and help possible to his harvest, so in the end he can be rewarded and have a good production.  Clober is a member of the communal bank \"Luz del Futuro Saino,\" one of the 100 member organizations of EDESA in Costa Rica.  This will be his second loan and he hopes to grow more on a personal and economic level.  He also stresses that he is thankful to these types of organizations and easier ways to access credit so he can dedicate more time to production activities.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Tanya Harper, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":370320,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase of supplies for his pineapple crop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":127,"posted_date":"2009-08-16T22:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Clober ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":585000,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":292500},{"due_date":"2011-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":292500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":110.52,"local_amount":64652.81,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:15:52Z","rounded_local_amount":64719.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118064837,"comment":null},{"amount":389.48,"local_amount":227847.19,"processed_date":"2010-08-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:01:17Z","rounded_local_amount":228080.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166831828,"comment":null},{"amount":0.85,"local_amount":496.7,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-19T09:42:26Z","rounded_local_amount":497.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189134224,"comment":null},{"amount":499.15,"local_amount":292003.3,"processed_date":"2011-08-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-21T08:01:32Z","rounded_local_amount":292302.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227780094,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-08-17T04:24:03Z","paid_date":"2011-09-21T08:01:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":129388,"name":"Comfort","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Comfort O. is married and has two children.

The main economic activities here are livestock and agriculture, most notably the production of pineapple.  The pineapple is mainly sold to international markets.

Do\u00f1a Sonia has dedicated a large part of her life to working in her home, and she also helps her husband with agriculture.  She recently had the idea of creating an entertainment room in her home so her neighbors could have fun in a healthy way.  Since she started this project, it has been very well accepted in her community.  She has been able to acquire video game machines, foosball tables, and other things.  \r\n\r\nSince her business is going so well, Sonia hopes to obtain a loan of 585,000 colones to buy more video game machines so she can expand her clientele and offer more variety.

Doris has had her shop for two years and has invested all of her recent loans from Manuela Ramos, a Kiva field partner, in products to sell. She will do the same with his loan of 1500 soles. When Doris first started working with Manuela Ramos in 2004, she sold only beer, soft drinks and popsicles. Now that she has her little store, she sells many other items. \r\n\r\nDoris is married and has three children, ages 23, 20 and 13, and a two-year-old granddaughter, all of whom live with her. Doris\u2019s husband is a regional salesman for a company based in Lima, the capital of Peru.\r\n\r\nDoris's business has been doing reasonably well. She manages to repay her loans without problems and is very careful to request only as much as she knows she can repay.\r\n \r\nDoris tends to sell more when school is in session. Many students walk by her shop on their way to class and stop to buy snacks. Doris uses all of the profits from her shop to help her family, particularly her children. Doris feels that her credit from Manuela Ramos has helped her a lot.

Es una peque\u00f1a comunidad rural de aproximadamente dos mil habitantes. Sus pobladores se dedican a la producci\u00f3n de leche y siembra de caf\u00e9. Tiene un relieve irregular y mucho del terreno se mantiene como bosque tropical h\u00famedo. La comunidad tiene paisajes muy pintorescos que combinan el bosque tropical con dos lindas lagunas, plantaciones de caf\u00e9 y lecher\u00edas. El Sauce se localiza aproximadamente a hora y media en bus de Turrialba, el centro de comercio m\u00e1s cercano. Sin embargo, varias veces al a\u00f1o el camino se vuelve intransitable por las lluvias que azotan la zona. Este es sin duda uno de los principales desaf\u00edos para la comunidad. \n\nCuando no exist\u00edan actividades muchas personas optaron por salir a buscar trabajos en Turrialba o en fincas bananeras ubicadas en la Zona Atl\u00e1ntica de Costa Rica. Actualmente los precios del caf\u00e9 y la leche han mejorado, por lo tanto los vecinos buscan c\u00f3mo invertir en proyectos en la misma zona y de esta forma evitar migrar.\n\nComo parte de las respuestas a esa situaci\u00f3n, desde hace dos a\u00f1os se instal\u00f3 en la comunidad una planta de elaboraci\u00f3n de quesos, propiedad de la Asociaci\u00f3n de Productores de Leche de El Sauce, hecho que motiv\u00f3 a don German a iniciar en la producci\u00f3n de leche para luego venderla a esta planta. \n\nAsegura que su familia  se ha dedicado a esta actividad durante mucho tiempo, por lo que ha podido experimentar todos los cuidados que demanda, adem\u00e1s de la instrucci\u00f3n recibida por parte de sus familiares  a lo largo del tiempo. \n\nEl queso de la regi\u00f3n donde vive don German es famoso en todo Costa Rica. Es un queso fresco que se le conoce tradicionalmente como \u201cqueso tipo Turrialba\u201d. A los \u201cticos\u201d (como se les conoce a los habitantes de Costa Rica) les gusta mucho consumir este producto; se le encontrar\u00e1 en las mesas acompa\u00f1ando cualquier tipo de comida.  Por esta raz\u00f3n, el mercado para dicho producto es realmente bueno.\n\nDon German desea obtener un micro cr\u00e9dito de \u00a2500,000 (quinientos mil colones) para comprar una vaca lechera y poder iniciar con su negocio ya que desea ser un microempresario exitoso y  as\u00ed poder ayudar a que su familia siga adelante esto es una de las cosas que lo motiva a esforzarse y trabajar con mucho esmero.\n\nDon German es socio de la Asociaci\u00f3n de Productores de El Sauce, una de las 100 organizaciones socias de EDESA en Costa Rica. Este ser\u00e1 su primer pr\u00e9stamo y con \u00e9l espera continuar creciendo a nivel personal y econ\u00f3mico. Tambi\u00e9n destaca que gracias a este tipo de organizaciones y medios facilitadores de cr\u00e9dito puede dedicar m\u00e1s tiempo a las actividades productivas. \n","en":"German M. R. is 44 and lives with his wife in a community called El Sauce de Santa Teresita de Turrialba in the province of Cartago.  This is a small rural community of approximately 2,000 people.  Its residents are dedicated to milk production and to growing coffee.  It has an irregular landscape, and much of the land is maintained as tropical forests.  The community has very picturesque landscapes that combine the tropical forest with lovely lakes, coffee plantations, and dairy farms.  El Sauce is located approximately an hour and a half from Turrialba, the nearest commercial center.  However, several times a year, the road becomes impassable due to the rains that slam the region.  This is without a doubt one of the biggest challenges for the community.\r\n\r\nWhen there weren't a lot of jobs in the area, many people opted to go out looking for work in Turrialba or at banana farms located in the Atlantic region of Costa Rica.  Currently the prices of coffee and milk have improved, so neighbors are looking to invest in projects in this region to avoid having to migrate to find work. \r\n\r\nAs part of the answer to this situation, two years ago, a cheese factory was built in the community.  It belongs to El Sauce's Association of Milk Producers.  This has motivated German to start producing milk to sell to this plant.\r\n\r\nHe assures us that his family has been dedicated to this work for a long time, which is why he has been able to experiment with all of the work that it demands.  He has also received training from his family members for a long time now.  \r\n\r\nThe cheese that comes from the region where German lives is famous throughout Costa Rica.  It's a fresh cheese that is traditionally knowh as \"Turrialba cheese.\"  \"Ticos\" (the name given to people from Costa Rica) like this product a lot, and it can be found on tables accompanied by any type of food.  For this reason, the market for this product is very good.\r\n\r\nGerman hopes to obtain a microcredit of 500,000 colones to buy a dairy cow and to be able to start his business.  He hopes to be a successful microbusinessman and to be able to help his family get ahea.  This is one of the things that motivates him to work very hard and very carefully.\r\n\r\nGerman is a member of the Producers Association of El Sauce, one of the 100 member organizations of EDESA in Costa Rica.  This will be his first loan, and he hopes to continue growing at a personal and economic level.  He also stresses that he is thankful to this type of organization and easier ways to access credit so he can dedicate more time to productive activities.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish

Sequeiro, 31, lives with his wife and two small daughters in a community named El Sa\u00edno de Pital.  It is located in the Alajuela province.  The main productive activities are livestock and agriculture.  Growing pineapple stands out because it is primarily sold in international markets.  For that reason, the development of the community has been growing in the last few years.  This generates a larger demand for products and services, which helps to mitigate the effect of immigration.\r\n\r\nFernando has devoted himself to growing pineapples since he was very young.  He, therefore, has considerable experience in the care and maintenance of this type of crop.  He has a small piece of land where he has previously grown pineapple.  It gave him good results at distribution time.  That is why he wishes to expand his fields.  Thanks to this business, his family\u2019s quality of life has improved considerably.\r\n\r\nFernando is asking for a loan for \u00a2400,000 (four hundred thousand colones) for maintenance and assistance in his fields.  He will also buy necessary supplies to guarantee a very good harvest.\r\n\r\nFernando is a member of the Luz del Futuro Saino Community Credit Company, one of the 100 organizations partnered with EDESA in Costa Rica.  This will be his third loan, and he expects to grow more on a personal and economic level.  Thanks to this type of organization and their means for facilitating loans, he can spend more time on his productive activities.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":370389,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Buy supplies and maintenance for planting pineapples","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":127,"posted_date":"2009-08-16T22:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fernando ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":400000,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":400000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":700}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":700,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:31:09Z","rounded_local_amount":409919.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195827342,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-08-17T16:18:51Z","paid_date":"2011-03-24T08:31:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":129413,"name":"Omar","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Omar R.

V. R. es un se\u00f1or de  a\u00f1os de edad que vive con su esposa y su hija en una comunidad llamada El Sauce de Santa Teresita de Turrialba, Provincia de Cartago.  Es una peque\u00f1a comunidad rural de aproximadamente dos mil habitantes. Sus pobladores se dedican a la producci\u00f3n de leche y siembra de caf\u00e9. Tiene un relieve irregular y mucho del terreno se mantiene como bosque tropical h\u00famedo. La comunidad tiene paisajes muy pintorescos que combinan el bosque tropical con dos lindas lagunas, plantaciones de caf\u00e9 y lecher\u00edas. El Sauce se localiza aproximadamente a hora y media en bus de Turrialba, el centro de comercio m\u00e1s cercano. Sin embargo, varias veces al a\u00f1o el camino se vuelve intransitable por las lluvias que azotan la zona. Este es sin duda uno de los principales desaf\u00edos para la comunidad. \nCuando no exist\u00edan actividades muchas personas optaron por salir a buscar trabajos en Turrialba o en fincas bananeras ubicadas en la Zona Atl\u00e1ntica de Costa Rica. Actualmente los precios del caf\u00e9 y la leche han mejorado, por lo tanto los vecinos buscan c\u00f3mo invertir en proyectos en la misma zona y de esta forma evitar migrar.\n\nDon Roberto ha dedicado la mayor parte de su vida a la producci\u00f3n de leche y queso como una forma de generar ingresos para su familia. Dice estar muy contento porque gracias a este proyecto ha podido salir adelante. Comenta que la producci\u00f3n de leche la vende a la planta de elaboraci\u00f3n de quesos, propiedad de la Asociaci\u00f3n de Productores de Leche de El Sauce.\n\nEl queso de la regi\u00f3n donde vive don Roberto es famoso en todo Costa Rica. Es un queso fresco que se le conoce tradicionalmente como \u201cqueso tipo Turrialba\u201d. A los \u201cticos\u201d (como se les conoce a los habitantes de Costa Rica) les gusta mucho consumir este producto; se le encontrar\u00e1 en las mesas acompa\u00f1ando cualquier tipo de comida.  Por esta raz\u00f3n, el mercado para dicho producto es realmente bueno.\n\nDon Roberto desea obtener un micro cr\u00e9dito por un monto de \u00a2500.000 (quinientos mil colones) para comprar una vaca lechera m\u00e1s y as\u00ed aumentar la producci\u00f3n de leche. El sabe que contar con una vaca m\u00e1s es un mayor sacrificio y demandar\u00e1 m\u00e1s trabajo. Sin embargo, el deseo de ser un microempresario exitoso y  sacar adelante a su familia mejorando las condiciones de vida, lo motiva a esforzarse con gran esmero y dedicaci\u00f3n.\n\nDon Roberto es cliente de la Asociaci\u00f3n de Productores de El Sauce, una organizaci\u00f3n local socia de la micro financiera EDESA. Este ser\u00e1 su d\u00e9cimo sexto pr\u00e9stamo y con \u00e9l espera continuar creciendo a nivel personal y econ\u00f3mico\n","en":"Roberto V. R. lives with his wife and daughter in the community of El Sauce de Teresita de Turrialba in Cartago Province.  It is a small rural community of approximately 2000 inhabitants.  The residents make their living producing milk or growing coffee.  The terrain is quite irregular and is comprised of mostly tropical rain forests.  The community has very picturesque views that combine tropical forests with two beautiful lagoons, coffee plantations, and dairy farms.  El Sauce is located approximately 1\u00bd hours away by bus from Turrialba, which is the nearest commercial center.  However, the roads become impassible several times a year whenever heavy rains hit the area.  This is undoubtedly one of the main challenges for the community.\r\n<p> \r\nWhen there is not enough work in the community, many people leave to find jobs in Turrialba or on banana plantations located in the Atlantic Zone of Costa Rica. Currently the price of coffee and milk has improved, so all of the neighbors seek to invest in projects in the local area to prevent migration. \r\n<p>\r\nDon Roberto has spent most of his life producing milk and cheese as a way of generating income for his family. He says he is content with his business because it has enabled him to get ahead.   Don Roberto sells his milk to a plant that produces cheese, an entity owned by the El Sauce Association of Milk Producers. \r\n<p>\r\nThe cheese from the region where Don Roberto lives is famous throughout Costa Rica. It is a fresh cheese that is traditionally known as <i>Turrialba<\/i> cheese.  <i>Ticos<\/i> (a term that refers to the residents of Costa Rica) enjoy this type of cheese so much that it is served with almost every meal.  For this reason, the market for this product is very good. \r\n<p>\r\nDon Roberto wishes to obtain a microloan of 500,000 colones  to buy another dairy cow so that he can increase his milk production.   He knows that having one more cow is a great sacrifice and demands more work. However, the desire to be a successful microentrepreneur will move his family forward and improve their living conditions.  These goals are what motivate him to strive with great care and dedication. \r\n<p>\r\nDon Roberto is a client of the El Sauce Association of Producers, a member organization of the microfinance cooperative EDESA. This will be his sixteenth loan and he hopes to continue growing personally and financially.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

In the near future, she hopes to have a very large shop in which she can sell many more products and, thus, improve her income so that she can give her parents a peaceful old age.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is Rosa\u2019s fourth loan with MFP, and she is committed to making her payments on time, just as she has done with prior loans.  She is a very happy person and beloved in her community bank, and she hopes to be able to continue working well with all her colleagues. She plans to invest the 1000 New Soles applied for in the purchase of more cheeses with which she hopes to increase her earnings.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Richard Brown, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":370540,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Increase in inventory","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-08-17T21:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":165}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-08-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:23:06Z","rounded_local_amount":171.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641713,"comment":null},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:36:20Z","rounded_local_amount":171.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87081165,"comment":null},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-10-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:06:56Z","rounded_local_amount":171.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997316,"comment":null},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-11-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:54:28Z","rounded_local_amount":171.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842660,"comment":null},{"amount":116.2,"local_amount":332,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:08:26Z","rounded_local_amount":340.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734242,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

She wishes to provide her son with a better life.  Yaneth is a seamstress and her work is much sought after in her neighborhood, since she is the only one there who  does this work.  She learned when she was very young from her mother and, now, she has her own shop, where she patiently cares for her customers.\r\n<p>\r\nWhat she likes best about her business is finishing the jobs entrusted to her.  She's been doing this for 5 years and considers her most difficult task to be working all day when she has a very large order.  She is very responsible and knows that any tardiness whatsoever could damage her reputation for being very punctual, which she has earned with much effort. In the near future, she hopes that her business may be better known and thus grow more.  For this, she is disposed to work very hard and without rest.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is her first loan request from MFP and she is very happy to have qualified.  She understands that she must pay it off on time and she intends to do so, since she does not wish to cause problems for her fellow members in the community bank where she is much loved and appreciated.

With the 2,000 nuevos soles she will purchase more wood to manufacture new furniture and will be able to increase her earnings.    \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Matthew Raimondi, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":370569,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Carpentry","sector":"Construction","use":"To purchase wood.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-08-18T02:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yolanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":335}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.55},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.55},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.55},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.55},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.55},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":117.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":116.55,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-08-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:23:41Z","rounded_local_amount":341.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641722,"comment":null},{"amount":116.55,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:36:10Z","rounded_local_amount":341.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87081174,"comment":null},{"amount":116.55,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:07:28Z","rounded_local_amount":341.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997325,"comment":null},{"amount":116.55,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:54:33Z","rounded_local_amount":341.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842669,"comment":null},{"amount":233.8,"local_amount":668,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-23T12:26:02Z","rounded_local_amount":685.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734251,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

1.000.00MT porque faz os seus trabalhos numa capoeira de aluguer pagando 1.000.00MT em cada fase.  \n\nRabeca sai de Gaza para Munic\u00edpio da vila de Namaacha (Fronteira da Suazil\u00e2ndia) quando tinha apenas 2 anos de idade com sua m\u00e3e, esta que andava a procura de emprego. Inicia os estudos muito tarde devido \u00e0 falta de condi\u00e7\u00f5es e quando frequentava a 4\u00aa classe a m\u00e3e fica desempregada, e ela teve que abandonar os estudos e trabalhar na empresa estatal como criadora de pintos durante 5 anos, para ajudar nas despesas da casa. \n\nAnos depois junta se com seu esposo que lhe deu um fundo para iniciar com seu pr\u00f3prio neg\u00f3cio de cria\u00e7\u00e3o e venda de frangos.

She is 41 years old, married, and is the mother of five children with ages ranging from 12 to 23 years.  Only the three youngest go to school.\r\n\r\nShe has no dependents, and relies on the help of her second son in her work.  She manages to save 1,000 MT per month because they run their business in a rented chicken coop that costs 1,000 MT for each phase.\r\n\r\nRabeca left Gaza when she was only two years old for the town of Namaacha (at the border of Swaziland) with her mother, who went there looking for work.  She began her schooling very late due to their financial situation.  When she was in fourth grade, her mother lost her job and she had to abandon her studies and work in a state-owned company as a chicken keeper for five years to help with household expenses.\r\n\r\nYears later, she married her husband, who gave her funds to begin her own business raising and selling chickens.  This involves an average of 2x100 chicks in each stage, which she has sold both wholesale and retail so as not to lose her clientele.  Spending 14,000 MT in each phase, she earns 4,000 MT in profit when she sells wholesale to dealers, and 6,000 MT in profit when she sells chickens singly to local consumers.  But later, due to enormous orders for her product, she approached Hluvuku and Kiva, asking for a loan in the amount of 10,000 MT to increase her livestock (to buy more chicks and feed) and to satisfy the needs of her customers on time.\r\n\r\nThis is Rabeca's third loan with Hluvuku and her first loan with Kiva.  The first loan of 9,200 MT and the second of 7,000 MT were used for the same purpose.  She is confident that she will repay the loan before it comes due and will ask for new loans to build her own chicken coop.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Heidi Petersen, Kiva

In addition to supporting his wife and children, he is also responsible for supporting his parents, sending them 1.000,00 mt per semester.\r\n\r\nHis schooling was interrupted in 10th grade so that he could fulfill his obligatory military service, after which time he took a basic course to become a police man and started working as a criminal investigation police officer in Michafutene. After resuming his high-school schooling years later, Xavier was promoted and sent to work in the town of Vila Namaacha, on the border of Swaziland, as Principal Sargeant at the town's police station. This work, with its schedule of 48 hours on\/48 hours off, earns him a monthly salary of 5.500.00 mt.\r\n\r\nWith his wife's help he was able to build a chicken coop and start a poultry raising business to improve the family's income. On average, he raises 4x100 boxes of baby chicks, profiting 10.000.00MT for each 28.000.00 mt spent.\r\n\r\nThis is Xavier's third loan with Hluvuku, and the first with Kiva. His first and second loans (14.000,00mt and  15.000,00mt, respectively) were also invested in the chicken raising business, and now that business is picking up, Xavier needs to invest some more money in it to answer the growing demand for his chickens. He plans to use the current loan of 22.000,00 mt to buy more one day-old chicks to raise and chicken feed.\r\n\r\nXavier is confident that he will be able to repay this loan before the end of the 15 month-term, and plans to apply for more loans in the future, to build a bigger coop and start raising ducks, turkeys and geese in addition to chickens.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

She is 48 years old and attended school through the 12th grade. She doesn't have any children. She takes care of her mother and her nephew, who live in Inhambane. She sends them 1000 meticals every three months.\r\n\r\nVioleta had the opportunity to go to Germany (the former GDR) when she was in 4th grade thanks to a scholarship she received from her school, where she trained to become a typist. After the reunification of the two Germanies, she returned to Mozambique, specifically to Inhambane. But later, because of the lack of jobs, she left Inhambane with her aunt and went to the town of Namaacha. Her aunt got her a job as a typist in the high school in Namaacha, where she's worked more than 16 years from 7:30 to 15:30, earning 2960.84 meticals a month. She lives in a room in the dormitories there.\r\n\r\nHer salary is not enough to meet her needs because she is building her own house with funding requested from BIM, a commercial bank that operates in Namaacha, in the amount of 20,000 meticals. She couldn't finish it because of the high cost of materials, and approached Hluvuku and Kiva requesting a loan of 8000 meticals to continue the work, buying building supplies.\r\n\r\nThis is Violeta's second loan with Hluvuku and her first with Kiva. The first loan of 5000 meticals was used to buy building supplies, as will the current 8000-metical loan so she can finish her house. She is eager to live in her own home.

The father of 5 children between the ages of 15 and 25 (the two youngest still in school), Fenias currently lives in Namaacha. In addition to supporting his family he also contributes 1.000,00 mt per month toward the care of his mentally disabled sister, who lives in Maputo.\r\n\r\nFenias left Gaza as a young men to go to Tete (in northern Mozambique) on a special mission as a military Commander, and soon after was sent to jail for 3 months for disagreeing with his superior's ideas and decisions. After being released from jail, he joined Renamo (a political party who fought against the Frelimo party in the 16-year civil war in Mozambique) and was sent to Swaziland, as a representative of the party, where he worked for 25 years. His years of work in Swaziland allowed him to build 18 rental places there, for which he charges 100 randes (the equivalent of 350.00 mt per unit). He counts with the help of his daughter to manage the places and collect rent.\r\n\r\nAs a reformed military he moved back to Mozambique and settled in Namaacha, a town on the border of Swaziland, where he has since been running a grocery store (located 45 km from Namacha and near an elementary school) serving people who prior to that had to travel much further to find a commercial establishment. Fenias bestselling products are fish, sugar, rice and crackers. He has one employee and earns 4.000.00 mt per month, which allows him to support his family, pay his helper's salary and still save about 2.000,00 mt.\r\n\r\nThis is Fenias' first loan with Hluvuku and Kiva (he has never applied for a loan before). He will use it to increase his stock, and expects to repay it without a problem. He plans to apply for more loans in the future, to keep investing in meeting the demand for his products as well as increasing the level of satisfaction of his clients.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br

In addition to supporting his family, he's also responsible for two nephews who live with them.\r\n\r\nAfter finishing high school, Luis took a three-year teaching course and upon graduating was stationed at a town very far from Maputo. After teaching there for 5 years, he went back to live with his family and extended family for a while, before renting a place and starting his own family. A few years after that he took a loan from the International Bank of Mozambique (BIM) to buy a piece of land to build a house and start a home-operated grocery store.\r\n\r\nHe has been living and working in Namaacha, on the border of Swaziland, for the past 5 years. Unable to keep the store in Maputo when he was transferred to Namaacha, Luis went nearly bankrupt.

He plans to use the 25.000,00MT loan, his first with Hluvuku and Kiva, to increase his stock. Currently, his bestselling products are the national beer 2M and soft drinks.

She\u2019s 55 years old; she\u2019s married and a mother of 6 children between 27 and 40. All of them have already finished their general education. However, she is still responsible for two of them and also her goddaughter who lives with her. \r\n\r\nClara lost her parents when she was a child and grew up with her grandfather on her mother\u2019s side, until he died when she was on 2nd grade. For this reason, and desperate after not having any relatives who could take care of her, she moved with a neighbor. Years later, she moves with her husband and gets pregnant with her first child, but at the same time her husband is recruited for mandatory military service for three years. So, Clara\u2019s life becomes even harder. After his arrival to Namaacha, he\u2019s assigned to work at the Vila de Namaacha and he moves with family with him.\r\n\r\nOnce there, and with the help of her husband, Clara opens her own kitchen pots business, buying products in Maputo capital and reselling them in Swaziland, their neighbor country by packages, on Thursdays and Saturdays from 5am to 6pm, at the local market where she can also exchange them for other products, spending 10,000.00MT on each trip. Her profits reach the 5,000.00MT depending on the season of the year. \r\n\r\nShe came to Hluvuku and Kiva to request for a 25,000.00MT loan to upgrade her business (purchasing more pots, that is, aluminum kitchen pots) \u2013 the Swazi community, on the South side of the African continent bears a strong tradition of using these type of pots to prepare their meals. \r\n\r\nThis is the second loan Clara receives from Hluvuku and the first one from Kiva. Her first loan was for 20,000.00 and was used to increase the stock of her products. She is confident she will repay this money before the stipulated time, and that she will be able to request for a new loan in order to build a farmyard for chicken breeding in her new house.  <br

Now they have more than 5,000 egg-laying hens.\r\n<p>\r\nThey need this loan to buy more chickens.  And, now, they need the assistance of ASDIR to develop economically, in order to improve the standard of living of each person.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Harold Sims, Kiva

Three years ago, she joined ASHI to take a loan to capitalize her business. At her age, she still wants to be productive and help her children, grandchildren and other relatives get out of poverty as much as she can. She started first with a variety store. With her subsequent loans, she was able to raise pigs and sell them after four months. Return on this kind of business is double the amount of her capital. With this profit and another loan, she was able to venture into financing farmers who grow rice. During harvest, the farmers she financed will give her a certain amount of rice depending on their price agreement. Rice paid to her will be sold in her variety store. Profits from these ventures have enabled her to pay her weekly payment to ASHI on time and maintain her business.\r\n\r\nNow Anesia wants to take a bigger loan to enhance her business more. Although she is a new businesswoman, she has seen her profit and productivity grow, and so she is seeking more capital to achieve her dreams for her business and family.\r\n\r\nOut of her profits,

L. is from the village of Agoho, Mambajao Camiguin. She is 44 years old, and is married with five school-aged children. To make a living, Flaviana owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. The main source of income for the business comes from raising pigs for sale. Flaviana has been engaged in her business for over 15 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Flaviana joined Kiva partner, HSPFI, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Flaviana is requesting a loan of 5000 PHP, which will be used to build shelter for her livestock. This loan will be her first from HSPFI.
