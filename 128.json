The group says that both the responsibility and the desire to work hard are helping them to develop their small businesses and support their families. Several of the women are teachers who have businesses on the side providing additional income to improve the lives of their families. \r\n<p>\r\nThe group members are involved in a variety of businesses: Noel, Luis and Julio all drive taxis or motorcycle taxis; Raquel owns a copy shop; Teresa, Lucia, Liliana and Celia sell clothing and underwear; Cecilia sells bread; Nancy and Celia sell prepared meals, while Maria Noemi sells Yambal cosmetic products and Rodolfo runs a body shop. Most of the group members plan to use their Kiva loan to purchase more merchandise to sell, supplies for their businesses, or ingredients to make meals.\r\n<p>\r\nThe group's president, Rosmeri B., is thankful for the support that AgroCapital has offered the group.

In order to light her house, Mrs. Chan T. wants to use the old system which uses a battery that generates electricity. Thus, Mrs. Chan T. decided to ask for a loan to buy a battery and a lamp for this purpose.\r\n\r\nTwo members have end-of-term loans and the rest have monthly payment loans. Two members are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK's main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia's poor.

In the first round of loan, she borrowed 2.000.000 VND to purchase cosmetic products and equipment for her salon. Before joining TYM, her shop was small; customers were often acquaintances. But since she invested more in her salon with the help of TYM, it has become increasingly popular, helping her earn about 70.000 to 100.000 per day. For the past 5 years, Mrs. H. has been using loans from TYM Fund to purchase new equipment, enhancing the quality of her salon. She also attended a make-up course, so she can give advice to her customers. As a result, her salon is now one of the best in her area. Now, Mrs. H. has to hire one employee to help her with all the work, with a salary of 1.000.000 VND per month. At the end of the year in particular, she has to hire 2 persons to assist her. Mrs. H.\u2019s monthly income is 5.000.000 VND. In the next round of loan, she would like to borrow 17.000.000 VND ($1025) to purchase more high-quality cosmetic products and modern equipment for her salon to attract more customers. <a><br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by KH.

It was difficult time for them finance wise. In 2004, her husband passed away. She joined TYM fund in 2000. Her first loan was 700.000 VND which was used to buy products for her hair salon. After 8 years and numerous loans later, she now owns a nice hair salon located in the heart of the town. She has built a solid base of clientele. She also sells beauty products due to increasing demand from the locals who are starting to consume this kind of product. On average, her income is 3.000.000 VNDS a month.

She used this money to buy 100 poultries to raise. 6 months later, she made a profit of 2800 Vietnamese Dong. Acknowledging the high return, the couple kept borrowing money and bought poultry in larger numbers. The business flourished, and the family\u2019s financial situation gradually became stable. \r\nMr. Tien, her husband, is a skillful and curious man.  He spent time studying business. In 2001, when the family\u2019s savings had accumulated, the couple started to build a modern farm on their old fields.  They raised chickens, ducks, and pigs.  They also planted bonsai.  Soon enough, there were thousands of poultries on the farm and hundreds of valuable bonsai.  A select 100 of these bonsai were of the Cau Vua type, a particularly valuable tree in Vietnam. They also planted vegetables to deliver to the local market. The family\u2019s income is from 5,000,000 to 7,000,000 Vietnamese Dong per month. She plans to make the next loan of 19,000,000 Vietnamese Dong to invest in the new farm.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by Duc Tran, Kiva

She used this money to invest in buying duck eggs, selling them at the local market and in bulk to restaurants.  The profit made daily was just enough to cover her family expenses.  The following years, she has been obtaining larger loans to increase the volume of her business.  In 2000, she was able to use the money she made to purchase a piece of land to build ducks houses for nesting and laying eggs.  Her inventory was enough to sell to the local market, eateries and restaurants.  After 10 plus years of borrowing along with smart investment, she has seen a success and growth with her business.  Presently, she has 2 egg warmers that produces 40.000 duck eggs a week, which she use to cater to eateries, restaurants and to the locals in her village.  This next loan, she is requesting 19.000.000 in which she plans to use for her business.

She worked hard to provide for her family, but she was unable to see the income coming in through her hard work.  In 1994, Ms. N. joins this organization in hope to better her family financially.  In the beginning, she was able to borrow and use the loan to invest in raising farm animals.  But in 2008, she got the courage to switch business from raising livestock to purchasing 2 sewing machines and started accepting workloads from several companies.  Ms. N. is a very skilled with her hands.  In addition to her work, she buys fabric to make pieces of clothing to sell in the local market.  She also offers tailoring services to the people in her village.  The family monthly income between raising farm animals and her sewing works average in about 4 to 5.000.000d\/month.  After a period of borrowing and investing, the family financial status has improved and since been stable.  She was able to build a 2 story home, furnishing it with quality items that have values.  She is requesting a loan of 19.000.000d to buy more sewing machines and capital for a convenient store business. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by Lynn Nguyen, Kiva

In order to improve their living conditions, the couple has been trying a variety of jobs, ranging from small retail to breakfast food service. In 2005, she joined the TYM fund and was able to borrow 3,000,000 Vietnamese Dong. She bought frogs and fish to breed and raise in the pond in her yard. In addition, she continues to serve breakfast to local customers. At the moment, her family is taking care of 5 frog stalls, which can be harvested every 3 months. She managed to improve the family\u2019s living conditions through clever use of its money. The family\u2019s income is now stable at 3,500,000 Vietnamese Dong per month. She plans to make the next loan of 15,000,000 Vietnamese Dong to buy more frogs and food for them. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by Duc Tran, Kiva

Before becoming a member of the Fund, she faced a lot of difficulties because of having many children and her income came mainly from her farming. She borrowed 20 USD to buy 2 pigs. After 4 months of membership, she earned 40 USD. Seeing that her project was productive, she decided to borrow more to invest in raising animals. In 2004, her husband joined the class about farming and farming projects. After the course, he applied his knowledge and expanded the farm to improve family economy. After 4 years of operation, Mrs. H. and her husband is having a well-equipped farm with a variety of plants, 100 pigs and 1000 chickens. This time, she and her husband want to borrow 1150 USD to invest more in the farm. \r\n<b><p>Translated from Vietnamese by Duy Hua, Kiva volunteer.<\/p><\/b>\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

One of Alla's further plans is to continue expanding her trade and eventually generate enough profit to finish remodeling her house and improve her family's living standards."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":199289,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To open a new children's clothing vending facility","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UA","country":"Ukraine","town":"Simferopol","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"44.95 34.1","type":"point"}},"partner_id":26,"posted_date":"2008-09-05T18:40:23Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alla","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-19T20:44:08Z","disbursal_currency":"UAH","disbursal_amount":5000,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2008-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2008-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2009-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2009-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2009-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2009-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2009-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":625}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":132,"local_amount":628.57,"processed_date":"2008-10-08T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-24T07:08:11Z","rounded_local_amount":634.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":352031,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":130.5,"local_amount":621.43,"processed_date":"2008-11-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T06:07:08Z","rounded_local_amount":626.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5323202,"comment":null},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":625,"processed_date":"2008-12-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T23:22:17Z","rounded_local_amount":630.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9942524,"comment":null},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":625,"processed_date":"2009-01-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T13:03:29Z","rounded_local_amount":630.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14866170,"comment":null},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":625,"processed_date":"2009-02-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T09:14:15Z","rounded_local_amount":630.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20408473,"comment":null},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":625,"processed_date":"2009-03-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T19:26:16Z","rounded_local_amount":630.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27101441,"comment":null},{"amount":131.24,"local_amount":625,"processed_date":"2009-04-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T20:21:04Z","rounded_local_amount":630.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35995626,"comment":null},{"amount":131.26,"local_amount":625,"processed_date":"2009-05-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:57:51Z","rounded_local_amount":630.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44578476,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-09-05T20:44:08Z","paid_date":"2009-06-15T23:57:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":63906,"name":"Amir","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Amir is 31 years old and married.

Esmelda gets up very early each morning to dive into selling her products--fish and various kinds of delicious shellfish.  They're expensive products but products that sell well because they are an important part of a healthy diet.  She's been operating the business for four years.  Sales are slow sometimes but very good at other times, Semana Santa (the week before Easter), for example, which was the time she began her business with money she had saved.  She didn't have a place to sell her products before, but with good advice and hard work, she managed to establish herself.  The requested loan is to buy a range of seafood so that Esmelda can continue to grow her small business and develop her business skills.

He is married and has three kids who are currently in school. He is a retailer of auto parts and is also an auto electrician. He buys his spare parts from dealers and re-sells them to his customers. As a result of his rich experience in the field, his numerous clients have a lot of trust and confidence in him and prefer to service their vehicles at his rented shop; he enjoys his business very much. However, he does not have adequate funds to support his business, especially with recent price hikes; therefore, he needs the loan to remain in business.
