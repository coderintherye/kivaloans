She is 53 years old and single. To make a living, Rico owns and operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling both food and daily use products in the local community. Rico has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Rico joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from HSPFI which was used to purchase additional products to sell. Rico is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and provide working capital. This will be the fourth loan that Rico has taken out  from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

She is married to Rogelio J., a driver, and is the mother of two children, both of whom are studying. The elder child is in high school while the other is enrolled in elementary. By the grace of God, Norma has managed to support her children's schooling. At this time, she is working hard to be able to send both of them all the way through college. This is a dream for most Filipino parents like Norma as she herself has been a college undergraduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents can leave to their children.\r\n\r\nNorma maintains a variety store and a direct selling business. She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics, frozen cuts of meat and other products mostly through the popular direct selling brand, Avon, and a popular local meat brand.  A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. The dealer\u2019s cost price is lower than the price in the catalogue, and these are the profits that dealers earn as their income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 600 in sales every day from her variety store and direct selling business.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy orders for her customers. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n \r\nNorma dreams of being able to give both her children a good, high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and pay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":617969,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy orders for her customers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Caloocan City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2010-10-15T10:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Norma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":4000.02,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:20:46Z","rounded_local_amount":4343.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177380507,"comment":null},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":3333.35,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-16T11:02:18Z","rounded_local_amount":3619.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182816841,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2666.63,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:43:07Z","rounded_local_amount":2895.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188652784,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-10-15T12:18:20Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T12:43:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":238551,"name":"Jerson","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jerson L. is from the village of Biasong.

P. is from the village of Lumbayao, Tampilisan, Zamboanga Del Norte. She is 41 years old, married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Imelda owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from planting and harvesting fruit and vegetables for sale. Imelda has been engaged in her business for over nine years and earns approximately 8,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Imelda joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. As with her previous loan of 7,000 PHP from PMPC which she has successfully repaid, this new loan of 10,000 PHP will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be the fourth loan that Imelda has taken out from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in north-western Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go for to buy one sachet of shampoo, PHP 5-worth of cooking oil or an egg. She earns by buying supplies at wholesale price and selling at the piece rate. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 300 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more products like groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n  \r\nGenie dreams of being able to renovate her house soon, with all of her work with the business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

With the revenues from this investment, Asylkan  plans to give a good education to her son. In the future, she plans to develop her farm by means of livestock breeding.

Aygul and her family went through some difficult times with little money and no house, but they did not give up and made every effort to improve their living conditions.

Her activity was marked by her designer's approach and personal advice to every client. \r\n\r\nIn 2009, in order to broaden her business, Aygul obtained her first loan of 20,000 KGS from Bai Tushum and Partners, which was repaid without any delays.

This school was founded in September 1985. It is staffed with 21 teachers and 600 pupils.\r\n\r\nThese hard-working and dedicated teachers have come to SMT, a partner of Kiva.org, to seek a loan of SLL 8,900,000. With the help of this loan, these teachers can embark on some meaningful projects that their mere salaries alone cannot do. Some of them will use the loan to buy pieces of furniture, others to buy house building materials, some a piece of land, some pay school fees for their children, and some of them will invest the loan in business. \r\n\r\nEdward O.K.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Her parents have been very supportive of the idea, which is why she ventured to make her dream come true about 13 years ago. Mehri wants to keep her enterprise running to be able to provide for her family and support her elderly parents, too. She has many bright ideas she is hoping to implement along the way. Mehri is a lively optimist and tries to mirror that attitude in her work as well. She is requesting a loan of $2,000 USD and is hoping to repay the loan without any delinquencies.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Victor is a dedicated father and producer. He plans to focus his efforts on the planting and harvesting of Cayenne peppers in an effort to improve living conditions. He works in cooperation with his family to strike a balance between accomplishing the daily tasks associated with agricultural production and the completion of domestic responsibilities.  In addition to his agricultural activity, Victor feels it is important to be an active member of his community. As a result, he dedicates a significant portion of his time to community meetings, groups and events. The rural zone where Victor and his family live is sparsely populated with infrequent bus service and a general lack of infrastructure. Victor is working hard towards the sustenance of his family, striving to reap the maximum benefits from his land and his labor. \r\n\r\nAlthough this is an individual loan, the community in which Victor and his family live is very close-knit and interdependent. Neighbors help and support one another by sharing experiences and expertise acquired over the years. All individual members of the Upala community are dedicated to the improvement of living conditions for the region as a whole.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to finance the production of Cayenne and Habanero peppers. Specifically, the loan will be used to finance the purchase of a variety of necessary agricultural nutrients, fertilizers and chemicals in order to ensure a healthy harvest. All laborial and logistical tasks associated with production will be carried out by Victor, with the help of his family members in the region of Upala. The production cycle (from planting to harvest) for these types of peppers is roughly one year. Victor planted his peppers 4 months ago and will expect to harvest in the next 8 months. Typically, he dedicates the hours from 6:00 AM to 4:00 PM everyday to his agricultural activities. \r\n\r\nPiper and Capiscum Processors Compa\u00f1\u00eda Agr\u00edcola Industrial (PROPICA) is an international buyer and seller of chili pepper and ground pepper products. In cooperation with Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer, PROPICA has guaranteed to purchase the agricultural products (the peppers) that are to be produced with the help of this loan. PROPICA acts as a guaranteed client for small agricultural producers in the area of Upala, thus ensuring that their products will reach market. \r\n\r\nThe main obstacle Victor and other producers in the Upala community face is a lack of access to working capital funds. The collaboration of Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer and PROPICA, represents a unique opportunity to Victor, his family and community. By offering a source of start-up capital and a guaranteed client to purchase what is produced, this is a chance to improve family and community standards of living. Above all, Victor wants to take advantage of the current opportunity that has been presented. He wants to profit from this collaboration and see improvements in his home and neighborhood. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":618243,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase of agricultural ingredients and chemicals.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Upala","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":151,"posted_date":"2010-10-15T20:10:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Victor","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":200000,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65568.25},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66661.05},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67770.7}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.14},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.32},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.54}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":178.28,"local_amount":89141.9,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-30T07:52:09Z","rounded_local_amount":90692.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201289985,"comment":null},{"amount":68.06,"local_amount":34031.6,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-29T07:55:39Z","rounded_local_amount":34623.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227043876,"comment":null},{"amount":153.66,"local_amount":76826.5,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:07:58Z","rounded_local_amount":78163.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232804911,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-10-16T08:55:11Z","paid_date":"2011-10-15T09:07:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":238690,"name":"Reebok Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lawama A. is in her late 30s, married, and has four children.

One of her children works and the other two are minors.  Together, with a lot of effort, they try to get ahead.  She has always thought of providing the best for her children, and for this reason when she was left alone she did not hesitate to start to work the best way that she could, which was to cook.  For the last 5 years she has been selling a variety of fast food dishes such as salchipapas (hot dog with fried potatoes) and papas rellenas (fried potato with ground meat filling), that are sought after because they are delicious and cheap.  Her working day begins at 4 in the afternoon when she puts a table with benches in an area outside her house, and her working hours usually extend until midnight when there is no food left to offer.  She is very pleased, because since her children help her to serve the customers she gets considerable daily earnings that allow her to get ahead.  In addition, as she is a very enterprising woman, she plans in the future to set up a grocery store in her house because she wants to have a business that is more stable and tranquil.  This is the 5th loan that she has taken with MFP, and she pledges to make her payments on time, since she does not want to disappoint the people who have made this loan possible which will allow her to continue to work and make progress.  Marcela will use the loan she requests to buy ingredients that she needs at wholesale, such as rice, cooking oil, and sugar, so that she can offer a variety of dishes to her customers.

Guillermo is a dedicated farmer. He plans to focus his efforts on the planting and harvesting of Cayenne and Habanero peppers. He works to strike a balance between accomplishing the daily tasks associated with agricultural production and the completion of domestic responsibilities. In addition to his agricultural activity, Guillermo feels it is important to be an active member of his community. As a result, he dedicates a significant portion of his time to community meetings, groups and events. The rural zone where Guillermo lives is sparsely populated with infrequent bus service and a general lack of infrastructure. Guillermo is working hard and striving to reap the maximum benefits from his land and his labor. \r\n\r\nAlthough this is an individual loan, the community in which Guillermo and his family live is very close-knit and interdependent. Neighbors help and support one another by sharing experiences and expertise acquired over the years. All individual members of the Upala community are dedicated to the improvement of living conditions for the region as a whole.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to finance the production of Cayenne and Habanero peppers. Specifically, the loan will be used to finance the purchase of a variety of necessary agricultural nutrients, fertilizers and chemicals in order to ensure a healthy harvest. All labor and logistical tasks associated with production will be carried out by Guillermo. The production cycle (from planting to harvest) for these types of peppers is roughly one year. Guillermo planted his peppers four months ago and will expect to harvest in the next eight months. Typically, he dedicates the hours from 6:00 AM to 4:00 PM everyday to his agricultural activities. \r\n\r\nPiper and Capiscum Processors Compa\u00f1\u00eda Agr\u00edcola Industrial (PROPICA) is an international buyer and seller of chili pepper and ground pepper products. In cooperation with Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer, PROPICA has guaranteed to purchase the agricultural products (the peppers) that are to be produced with the help of this loan. PROPICA acts as a guaranteed client for small agricultural producers in the area of Upala, thus ensuring that their products will reach market. \r\n\r\nThe main obstacle Guillermo and other producers in the Upala community face is a lack of access to working capital funds. The collaboration of Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer and PROPICA represents a unique opportunity to Guillermo, his family and community. By offering a source of start-up capital and a guaranteed client to purchase what is produced, this is a chance to improve living conditions for Guillermo as well as the community at large. Above all, Guillermo wants to take advantage of the current opportunity that has been presented. He wants to profit from this collaboration and see improvements in his home and neighborhood. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":618261,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase agricultural chemicals and nutrients.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Upala","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":151,"posted_date":"2010-10-15T23:20:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Guillermo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":200000,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65568.25},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66661.05},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67770.7}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.14},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.32},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.54}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":132.93,"local_amount":66466.67,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:42:46Z","rounded_local_amount":67623.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191428402,"comment":null},{"amount":133.35,"local_amount":66676.02,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:42:48Z","rounded_local_amount":67836.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196970541,"comment":null},{"amount":133.72,"local_amount":66857.31,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-16T08:18:41Z","rounded_local_amount":68020.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201289986,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-10-16T15:52:00Z","paid_date":"2011-04-16T08:18:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":238703,"name":"Agnes","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Agnes O. is married to an accountant and has five dependants.

Mayra is a dedicated producer and mother. She plans to focus her efforts on the planting and harvesting of Cayenne peppers. She works in cooperation with her family to strike a balance between accomplishing the daily tasks associated with agricultural production and the completion of domestic responsibilities. The land she works is her own. In addition to her agricultural activity, Mayra feels it is important to be an active member of her community. As a result, she dedicates a significant portion of her time to community meetings, groups and events. The rural zone where Mayra and her family live is sparsely populated with infrequent bus service and a general lack of infrastructure. Mayra is working hard towards the sustenance of her family, striving to reap the maximum benefits from her land as well as her labor. \r\n\r\nAlthough this is an individual loan, the community in which Mayra and her family live is very close-knit and interdependent. Neighbors help and support one another by sharing experiences and expertise acquired over the years. All individual members of the Upala community are dedicated to the improvement of living conditions for the region as a whole.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to finance the production of Cayenne peppers. Specifically, the loan will be used to finance the purchase of a variety of necessary agricultural nutrients, fertilizers and chemicals in order to ensure a healthy harvest. All labor and logistical tasks associated with production will be carried out by Mayra with the help of her family members in the region of Upala. The production cycle (from planting to harvest) for these types of peppers is roughly one year. Mayra expects to harvest in the next eight months. Typically, she dedicates the hours from 7AM to 4PM everyday to her agricultural activities. \r\n\r\nPiper and Capiscum Processors Compa\u00f1\u00eda Agr\u00edcola Industrial (PROPICA) is an international buyer and seller of chili pepper and ground pepper products. In cooperation with Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer, PROPICA has guaranteed to purchase the agricultural products (the peppers) that are to be produced with the help of this loan. PROPICA acts as a guaranteed client for small agricultural producers in the area of Upala, thus ensuring that their products will reach market. \r\n\r\nThe main obstacle Mayra and other producers in the Upala community face is a lack of access to working capital funds. The collaboration of Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer and PROPICA represents a unique opportunity to Mayra, her family and community. By offering a source of start-up capital and a guaranteed client to purchase what is produced, this is a chance to improve family and community standards of living.

She stocks up from suppliers in the town of Sikasso and sells all her produce in the market at Bougouni, on a wholesale and retail basis, for cash and on credit to a customer base made up of men and women. \r\n\r\nWith this loan she hopes to make a monthly profit of 40,000FCFA, while the other members of the group are counting on making a monthly profit of 25,000FCFA, part of which will be used for their businesses and part for their children's school fees.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":618292,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase of tubers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Bougouni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.416667 -7.483333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-10-15T13:20:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kadia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Minata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adiara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mama  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":200000,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:40:26Z","rounded_local_amount":35215.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182613633,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:43:19Z","rounded_local_amount":35215.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188752068,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-17T00:56:56Z","rounded_local_amount":35215.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191606315,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:19:56Z","rounded_local_amount":35215.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195917976,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2011-03-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T12:12:31Z","rounded_local_amount":35215.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201360902,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":33333.35,"processed_date":"2011-04-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:48:21Z","rounded_local_amount":35215.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206226208,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-10-15T15:03:37Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T11:48:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":238727,"name":"Morena Guadalupe","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Morena Guadalupe P.

Es el tercer cr\u00e9dito que tiene con MFP, y promete pagar sus cuotas puntualmente pues no quiere quedar mal con las personas que hicieron posible el dinero que le permitir\u00e1 continuar trabajando en busca del progreso. Diana tiene planeado invertir el cr\u00e9dito solicitado en la compra de materiales para refaccionar el patio de su casa, as\u00ed como el pago de mano de obra del alba\u00f1il, de esta manera  espera aumentar sus ganancias. \n\n","en":"Diana, age 59, lives in her own house together with her husband F\u00e9lix, age 60, who is a driver, along with her 5 grown children and 2 grandchildren. Every day, they combine their efforts to work and get ahead. Six months ago, Diana established a business renting video games on the patio of her home. Since then, she has obtained a steady income which has allowed her to help her husband with the household expenses. The 4 video game machines she has are rented, and the monthly earnings are shared with the owner. Because the business has grown within a short time, she urgently needs to renovate the patio of her home, where the machines are located, because the imperfections in the floor do not allow her best customers to use the games effectively. Diana likes her work very much, because she says it is pleasant work, and she can do it from the comfort of her home, and most importantly, she does not need to neglect her work within the household. In addition, since she is an enterprising woman, she has plans to expand the business in the future and buy 2 video game machines so she can work independently. This is her third loan with MFP, and she promises to make her payments on time, since she does not want to disappoint the people who made this funding possible, which will permit her to keep working in her quest for progress. Diana plans to invest the loan she is requesting in buying materials to renovate the patio of her home, and also paying masons for their work, and in this way she hopes to increase her earnings. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":618306,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Machinery Rental","sector":"Services","use":"Buying materials to renovate the floor of her patio [where her business is located] and hiring masons","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-10-17T03:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Diana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":181.31},{"due_date":"2010-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":187.18},{"due_date":"2010-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":196.05},{"due_date":"2011-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":203.03},{"due_date":"2011-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":211.42},{"due_date":"2011-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":221.01}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.99},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.19},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.52},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.14},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.28},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.88}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":67.99,"local_amount":181.31,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:13:39Z","rounded_local_amount":190.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177450030,"comment":null},{"amount":70.19,"local_amount":187.18,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:00:40Z","rounded_local_amount":196.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588728,"comment":null},{"amount":149.66,"local_amount":399.08,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:41:27Z","rounded_local_amount":418.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191463323,"comment":null},{"amount":162.16,"local_amount":432.43,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:38:05Z","rounded_local_amount":453.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201327068,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-10-17T08:11:32Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T11:38:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":238735,"name":"Idrissa Mohamed","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is 32-year-old Idrissa.

In cooperation with Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer, PROPICA has guaranteed to purchase the agricultural products (the peppers) that are to be produced with the help of this loan. PROPICA acts as a guaranteed client for small agricultural producers in the area of Upala, thus ensuring that their products will reach market. \r\n\r\nThe main obstacle Lorena and other producers in the Upala community face is a lack of access to working capital funds. The collaboration of Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer and PROPICA represents a unique opportunity to Lorena, her family and community. By offering a source of start-up capital and a guaranteed client to purchase what is produced, this is a chance to improve family and community standards of living. Above all, Lorena wants to take advantage of the current opportunity that has been presented. She wants to profit from this collaboration and see improvements in her home and neighborhood. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":618363,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase agricultural chemicals and nutrients.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Upala","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":151,"posted_date":"2010-10-16T03:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lorena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":200000,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65568.25},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66661.05},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67770.7}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.14},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.32},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.54}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":20.28,"local_amount":10141,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:06:07Z","rounded_local_amount":10317.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206158226,"comment":null},{"amount":191.67,"local_amount":95835.68,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:10:09Z","rounded_local_amount":97503.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216510428,"comment":null},{"amount":188.05,"local_amount":94023.32,"processed_date":"2012-02-01T07:59:59Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-01T09:07:25Z","rounded_local_amount":95659.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":259110066,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-10-16T06:27:03Z","paid_date":"2012-03-01T09:07:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":238771,"name":"Lidia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lidia started her own business when she was 50 years old.

She has one son but she lives alone in the community of Huaracayo.  The years of dedication and service she spent raising her son taught her that there is no better reward in life than seeing your children progress.  Ten years ago, she began to work in agriculture, raising corn and peas.  After growing them, she takes them to the central market in the capital where she sells them wholesale.  Now, she would like to open a small hardware store in the central area of her native city of Tarma, because she understands that she does not have the strength that she used to; she feels alone and wants to be close to her son who lives in the city.  This is her first loan through MFP and she is very happy to belong to a village bank that is very well-respected in her neighborhood.

Domidia is a dedicated producer and mother. She plans to focus her efforts on the planting and harvesting of Cayenne peppers. She works in cooperation with her family to strike a balance between accomplishing the daily tasks associated with agricultural production and the completion of domestic responsibilities. The land she works is her own. In addition to her agricultural activity, Domidia feels it is important to be an active member of her community. As a result, she dedicates a significant portion of her time to community meetings, groups and events. The rural zone where Domidia and her family live is sparsely populated with infrequent bus service and a general lack of infrastructure. Domidia is working hard towards the sustenance of her family, striving to reap the maximum benefits from her land as well as her labor. \r\n\r\nAlthough this is an individual loan, the community in which Domidia and her family live is very close-knit and interdependent. Neighbors help and support one another by sharing experiences and expertise acquired over the years. All individual members of the Upala community are dedicated to the improvement of living conditions for the region as a whole.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to finance the production of Cayenne peppers. Specifically, the loan will be used to finance the purchase of a variety of necessary agricultural nutrients, fertilizers and chemicals in order to ensure a healthy harvest. All labor and logistical tasks associated with production will be carried out by Domidia with the help of her family members in the region of Upala. The production cycle (from planting to harvest) for these types of peppers is roughly one year. Domidia expects to harvest in the next eight months. Typically, she dedicates the hours from 7AM to 4PM everyday to her agricultural activities. \r\n\r\nPiper and Capiscum Processors Compa\u00f1\u00eda Agr\u00edcola Industrial (PROPICA) is an international buyer and seller of chili pepper and ground pepper products. In cooperation with Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer, PROPICA has guaranteed to purchase the agricultural products (the peppers) that are to be produced with the help of this loan. PROPICA acts as a guaranteed client for small agricultural producers in the area of Upala, thus ensuring that their products will reach market. \r\n\r\nThe main obstacle Domidia and other producers in the Upala community face, is a lack of access to working capital funds. The collaboration of Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer and PROPICA represents a unique opportunity to Domidia, her family and community. By offering a source of start-up capital and a guaranteed client to purchase what is produced, this is a chance to improve family and community standards of living. Above all, Domidia wants to take advantage of the current opportunity that has been presented. She wants to profit from this collaboration and see improvements in her home and neighborhood. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":618399,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase agricultural chemicals and nutrients.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Upala","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":151,"posted_date":"2010-10-16T03:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Domidia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":200000,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65568.25},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66661.05},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67770.7}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.14},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.32},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.54}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":15.31,"local_amount":7656.8,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-14T08:19:46Z","rounded_local_amount":7790.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196970543,"comment":null},{"amount":5.35,"local_amount":2673.4,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-30T07:52:11Z","rounded_local_amount":2719.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201289987,"comment":null},{"amount":37.76,"local_amount":18879.84,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:06:10Z","rounded_local_amount":19208.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206158228,"comment":null},{"amount":286.35,"local_amount":143174.51,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-29T07:55:41Z","rounded_local_amount":145665.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227043878,"comment":null},{"amount":55.23,"local_amount":27615.45,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:19:01Z","rounded_local_amount":28095.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238616099,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-10-16T07:32:51Z","paid_date":"2011-11-15T10:19:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":238787,"name":"Yessica Patricia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Yessenia de 36 a\u00f1os, tiene una peque\u00f1a papeler\u00eda en la parte delantera de su casa, vive en el Para\u00edso de Guayaquil (zona periurbana, con caminos de tierra y las casas est\u00e1n ubicadas en monta\u00f1as). \n\nInicio su negocio hace tres a\u00f1os atr\u00e1s desde que su mama con uno de sus hermanos le comenzaron a enviar dinero del extranjero  para invertir en una papeler\u00eda.

Currently, she is dedicated to sewing and selling plastic items. Her sewing is very good quality and is the product that stands out most from everything she sells due to the fact that few people are dedicated to this type of work because of the time required. Despite this, Andrea likes her work and considers it to be the foundation for her to sell day after day and get ahead.\r\n\r\nAndrea's goal in requesting this loan is to gradually grow her business and, from the income she obtains, to help her son finish his education since she was never able to do so due to the shortcomings of her life.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2425,"image":{"id":618413,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cloth & Dressmaking

Gutierrez will use this loan to move her business, Electronic Tax Refund, from its current location in a cramped office to a larger, more inviting space across the street. The current location is so small that her customers have to wait outside to be helped.  The new office will allow her to help her customers more efficiently and comfortably. \r\n\r\nWhen she was 4 years old, Noelia and her family came to the United States from Mexico, working as migrant field workers. As a child, Noelia worked hard in school, and while not in school, she worked in vegetable and cotton fields with her family. When her father was diagnosed with cancer, her mother would pull Noelia out of school to sell tamales in order to pay the hospital fees. On the weekends, Noelia spent her time either selling tamales or working in the fields. Their neighbor worked as a notary public from home and started to teach Noelia how to complete income tax returns. The concept of working from home was incredibly appealing to Noelia. At the age of 14, she started doing the income tax returns of all the field workers for free so she could get experience. Noelia knew at a young age that she wanted a different life for herself and her family.\r\n\r\nAs a young adult, Noelia worked both in the fields and at an income tax firm as a clerk, and went to vocational night school. After graduating, she started helping people do their tax returns out of her house and it turned into a full-fledged business. \r\n\r\nThis is not her first loan from ACCION Texas. Her first loan helped her pay for computers because previously everything was recorded by hand. This upgrade was instrumental to increasing the number of individuals she served from 150 to 3,000 clients.  \r\n\r\nNoelia plans to eventually expand her business to more office locations in the Rio Grande Valley. She believes her business is so successful because she provides high quality work for an affordable price. She gives back by doing free tax returns for field workers who cannot afford her services. Currently, Noelia employs her husband and family at her office, and thus Noelia successfully reached her dream of creating a different life for herself and her

At a young age, Nery learned to farm and when she grew up and consolidated her family she was able to acquire land where she cultivates beans, peas and spinach. With time and the experience that she has, she was able to adapt to the market and rent more farmland. With this, she was able to plant in great quantities and obtain better earnings. Now, she wishes to buy her own farmland and open her own restaurant. This is her fifth loan with MFP and she is very happy to belong to her community bank where unity and solidarity reigns. With this loan, she will obtain fertilizers for her bean crops since she will harvest them very soon.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":618479,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Comprar fertilizantes para cuidar su cultivo de habas.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-10-17T16:40:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nery ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:12:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1048.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221718190,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-10-17T17:36:15Z","paid_date":"2011-08-15T09:12:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":238807,"name":"Maria Magdalena","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maria is 26 years old and has no children.

They are his joy and happiness.  They live in his  house located in the town of Huaracayo.  For 40 years, he has worked by planting cuzco corn (a hybrid variety of corn whose kernels are bigger and tastier), lettuce, spinach, and cabbage. What he most likes about farming is to be able to plant and care for the goods nature gives him. Through his care, he assures the quality of his crops.  In the same way, he has a small garden near his house where he plants lemons which are the biggest and juiciest in town. Guillermo also works by  buying and selling from a cart.  He buys at a certain price and then sells at a higher price. This transaction creates a lot of money. Thanks to his good business judgement, Guillermo saved money to buy more land to cultivate in which he is thinking about planting a greater quantity of vegetables. \r\n\r\nThis is his tenth credit with MFP and as an authority of his community bank, we feel prideful to be able to help people that, like him, want to prosper.

She and her husband live in the village of Lawis Panalsalan and have four adult-aged children. \r\n\r\nIn 2000, Leonarda joined PMPC to gain access to financial services. Her goal was to help improve her living situation and increase her ability to engage in business activities. Leonarda has successfully repaid a previous loan of 35,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to invest in expanding the business. Leonarda is requesting a new loan of 35,000 PHP which will be used to pay for services to increase crop yield. This loan will be the 22nd loan taken out by Leonarda from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

P., 33 years old, is a loving and self-sacrificing mother of three children, all of them young and in need of her support. Vangie harbors a strong desire in her heart to increase her capital in order to acquire a larger inventory of fish in her stall, thereby creating more revenue for her family. Above all, she hopes to offer a better quality of life for her beloved children. Vangie is requesting a loan of 45,000 PHP to pay for a pump boat for her husband to use to catch more fish and, with the remaining money, to purchase inventories of fish to sell in the market place. Let\u2019s get together behind this devoted mother to help her bring well-being and security to the members of her family. Vangie believes that her business will help her family rise up and fight against poverty and will provide for the family's needs, especially in educating her three children. Her eldest child is a junior high school student and the other two are elementary students.

She is 44 years old. Fe is the group leader of a 2-member group loan offered by PMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nFe is married and has 3 school-aged children. She owns and operates a general store, selling a variety of different products in the local community. Fe has been engaged in her business for over 13 years and earns approximately 2,400 PHP a month from it.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Fe joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Fe has successfully repaid a previous loan of 12,000 PHP from PMPC, which was used to to purchase additional inventory and increase working capital. Fe is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the 9th loan taken out by Fe from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's general living conditions.\r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

a mother of two, is 45 years old. She is a hard-working entrepreneur who wants to be able to help her family. Working closely with her husband Reynato, she makes and sells ready-to-eat food. She started the business seven years ago to help her family meet its education expenses, as well as water, electricity and food expenses. All of these items are very expensive.  \r\n\r\nNow, Gina has requested 35,000 PHP as additional working capital for her business. She is positive that her business will grow, since she already has regular customers in her local area submitting orders. Specifically, the loan will be used to buy more ingredients. She is pleased because, in the past, she has managed to utilize the loans to invest in her business.\r\n\r\nWith working capital, Gina's business will continue to grow and she will be able to provide excellent products to her regular customers. With the support of KIVA lenders, Gina hopes to improve the standard of living for herself and her family and lift them out of poverty. \r\n \r\nShe dreams of having a permanent space in the marketplace where she can sell her food in order to earn a much larger income. Gina is grateful to ASHI for offering her happiness in life and group support in achieving her goals.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of her membership in ASHI, Gina has been a model member, dedicated to managing her family\u2019s operations.

Her colleagues characterize her as a very optimistic and responsible person.   Saltanat has four children: her elder son studies at the Institute of Arts and dreams of being a famous musician and the others are schoolchildren.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, salaries of teachers in rural areas are low and do not cover the family\u2019s expenses.  For this reason, Saltanat started her own business in cattle breeding. She used 5,000 Kyrgyz Soms to purchase cattle for fattening, and she resold it at the local livestock market on weekends.  Saltanat worked hard to make her business successful and today has three milk cows, seven goats and one horse.  Using the revenues from selling fattened cattle, she was able to pay for the education of her elder son. \r\n\r\nSaltanat plans to use the loan of 50,000 Kyrgyz Soms to broaden her business by purchasing sheep and bull calves.

S. is very positive and energetic woman. She lives in Belovodskoe village, 54, married and has three grown children. She graduated from agricultural college and still works as a veterinarian. Her husband worked as a driver, but his wage was very low and didn\u2019t cover all expenses.\r\n\r\nIn order to support the family and find an additional means of subsistence for her children, Galina decided to breed animals. In 1995, using her initial capital of 5,000 Kyrgyz Soms (KGS), she started to breed rabbits and pigs, which became a profitable activity. With the revenues, Galina was able to pay for education for her children and now her elder daughter works as a cheese maker at the dairy factory, the second daughter is seamstress, and the younger son is a student at technical college.\r\n\r\nHer tireless personality and hardworking activities lead Galina to engage in poultry farming and today her farm has turkeys, ducks and chicken. This has allowed her to buy a sewing machine for her daughter.  Now Galina plans to use this loan of 50,000 KGS to buy eight pigs and forage for her livestock.

V., Cauayan City, Isabela. She is 39 years old. Luzviminda is the group leader of a 10-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nLuzviminda is married and has seven school-aged children. To make a living, Luzviminda owns and operates a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling fruits and vegetables in the community. Luzviminda is just starting this business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Luzviminda joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Luzviminda has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 Philippines pesos (PHP) from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. \r\n\r\nLuzviminda is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP, which will also be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the second loan taken out by Luzviminda from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\n<b>About ASKI:<\/b>\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

K. is 25 years old and from Misikhu area in Kakamega. He is single and has no dependants at the moment.\r\nAndrew has been running a business rearing dairy cows for the past eight months. Most of his customers come to buy fresh milk from him but he also supplies milk to the shops around.

O. is from the village of Bagong Tanza. She is 38 years old. Rosalie is married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Rosalie owns & operates a service-based business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes providing manicure and pedicure services in the local community. Rosalie has been engaged in her business for over 15 years and earns approximately 4000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Rosalie joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Rosalie has successfully repaid a previous loan of 11,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase materials needed to provide service. Rosalie is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to purchase materials needed to provide service. This will be the 9th loan taken out by Rosalie from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

With the help of her past 5 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Liza has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow.

With the help of her past 9 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Cheryl Marie has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. \r\n\r\nHer previous loan of 29,500 Philippine pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of 6000 PHP, thus raising the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 10th cycle loan, she is again borrowing 29,500 PHP which she intends to use as additional capital for her small eatery so that she can continue to save up for the future, especially that of her children. \r\n\r\nCheryl Marie V. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

F. is a married woman who lives in Brgy. Poblacion, Oslob, Cebu. She earns her living by operating two business ventures: fish vending and pig fattening businesses. Her husband, Carlito F. Sr., age 31, works as a fisherman to earn his living. They have three children who are 5 to 10 years old. This picture was taken after the center meeting because her fish business was already sold out early in the morning.\r\n\r\nCorsine joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she wanted something better for her family. With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, and by the sweat of her brow, Corsine has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty. Her previous loan of 12,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000; thus, improving the family's standard of living. This time, for her fifth loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000, which she intends to use as additional capital for her fish vending business. She will continue to save up for the future and meet the daily needs of her family. Corsine F. is a <i>Dungganon<\/i> woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means <u>honorable<\/u>). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them <i>Dungganon<\/i> - a title of esteem  that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

R. is a married woman who lives in Brgy. Tan-awan, Oslob, Cebu. She earns her living by operating two business ventures: fish vending and pig fattening. Her husband, Misael R., who is 37 years old, works as a driver to earn his living.  They have three children who are 6 to 14 years old. Marilou joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 13 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Marilou has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 14th loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000, which she intends to use to purchase more fish to sell so that she can continue to save up for the future and for her family. Marilou R. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  Photo was taken at the center because her business was sold out early in the morning. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Uk S. is a 42-year-old married woman and local farmer who has been living in province of Kompong Chhnang. She owns a piece of farmland that she inherited many years ago from her grandparents. She uses this land to grow different kinds of crops. Her children, who are all teenagers, study at public school. Mrs. Uk S. has raised a lot of piglets and she had hoped to sell them to buyers three or four months after she began raising them. Unfortunately, the pigs are not big enough, due to the lack of food.

Her previous loan of PHP 12,000 (which she paid off well within its term) was just another step on her journey towards economic freedom.

A. is a married woman who lives in Brgy. Maningcao, Sibulan, Negros Oriental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  Fruits & Vegetables Vending and Selling Standing Crops. Her husband, Modesto A., who is 49 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living.  They have three children who are 17 to 27 years old.  Lorna joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past nine loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Lorna has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 12,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 10th loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000, which she intends to use to purchase more stock of fruits and vegetables to sell so that she can continue to save up for the future expansion of her business assets. Lorna A. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n About NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Ca\u00f1ete earns her living by operating three business ventures: a general store, a chainsaw rental service, and a farming business. Her husband, Sonny Ca\u00f1ete, age 49, works as a chainsaw operator to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have 12 children who are between the ages of 8 and 30. The family lives in Gilside, Brgy. Nabulao, Sipalay City, Negros Occidental. \r\n\r\nFlorenda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1998 because she aspired toward something better for her family. With the help of her past 13 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Florenda has been working hard and incrementally lifting her family out of poverty. Her previous loan of PHP 6,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 20,000, which helped to improve the family's standard of living. \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 14th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 18,000, which she intends to use to purchase an expanded inventory for her general store so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Florenda Ca\u00f1ete is truly a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon. Dungganon is a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable.\" Through this alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass anything they could have imagined.

Liloan, Santander, Cebu. She earns her living running a general store and food vending business. Her husband, Rolden P., age 34, works as a driver. They have two children who are 6 and 10 years old. \r\n\r\nAires joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she wanted something better for her family. With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, and by the sweat of her brow, Aires has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty. Her previous loan of 13,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 7,000, improving the family's standard of living. This time, for her fifth loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000, which she intends to use to purchase more stock to sell so that she can continue to save up for the future to send her children to school. Aires P. is a <i>Dungganon<\/i> woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means <u>honorable<\/u>).

Her previous loan of PHP 13,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom. Ana hopes to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well being by following the  Dungganon way.  \r\n\r\n<p>About NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

La Paz, Bogo City, Cebu. She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures: a general store and curtain sales. Her husband, Gaspar Jupiter P., 44 years old, works overseas to earn his living. They have 1 child who is 16 years old. Gina joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she hoped for something better for her family. With the help of her past 5 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Gina has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 14,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 6th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 20,000 which she intends to use as additional working capital for her general store and curtain sales business so that she can continue to save up for her daughter's future education. Gina P. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\n<p>About NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.
