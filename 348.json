She makes pants, shirts, and dresses, etc.  One of the complications that she has with her work is that she sometimes gets sick.  \r\n\r\nShe wants to use the loan to buy a large sewing machine in order to have another person working with her.  In the future she wants to have fixed employees for her business.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

The members sell perfume, earrings, necklaces, pots, napkins, pastries and toys.  During their time with Emprender they have participated in 6 loan cycles; the founding members of the bank have remained, and they have expanded their membership by 10 percent.\r\n\r\nSenora Rosse Es is the leader, president, and one of the founding members of the bank.  This is her 6th loan cycle, and she is taking on the position of bank president.  She has been a merchant since she was very young; she sells jewelry and other miscellaneous items, including cosmetics.  She has 3 daughters; the middle daughter helps her with the sales.  Her husband does not generate much income, and for this reason she must continue to work to support her family so that she can help her husband so that the family lacks for nothing in the home, and so that she can proviD. support for the education of her children so that in the future they can have a profession and a better economic situation.  Her participation in the group came about thanks to her companions who invited her to join the group.\r\n\r\nThe loans they obtained were invested in their capital and were also used to allow the members to travel to sell in markets in other regions of the country such as Santa Cruz and Cochabamba.\r\n\r\nPatricia is one of the organizers and founders of a group that evolved into the communal bank Nueva Luz; she has worked with Emprender for 3 years.  She is the treasurer of the bank, and is one of the most dynamic members of the group; she has been very demanding of the other members during the time she has been with the group.  \r\n\r\nPatricia sells a variety of products (jewelry and other consumer goods) with her cart.  She travels with her products to markets and fairs to sell her goods.  She works with her husband in this business.  She has 3 daughters; her oldest daughter is 12, and the younger ones are 8 and 3 years old.  The loan she obtained helped her substantially in being able to improve the economic status of her family, and to proviD. a better life for her children, as she was able to generate an increased income by increasing her working capital. \r\n\r\nPatricia will use this loan to invest in the purchase of a store or sales post in one of the markets.  Her wish is to be able to have her own home and a store.  She hopes that these dreams will become reality in the future.  \r\n\r\nCristina Es, one of the founders of the bank, currently sells cosmetics, socks, rings, wallets and other items from a cart.  Cristina is an enterprising woman who supports her 2 daughters on her own.  She came to know the financial institution Emprender thanks to her companions, who invited her to become part of the group.  In this way she was able to access a loan, which helped her to increase her merchandise.  This was a great help to her, as thanks to the loan, she was able to pay for the education of her daughter who is in school.  In addition, Cristina makes quilts and bed sheets by hand in her free time.  \r\n\r\nAll of the members are grateful to Emprender and Kiva for the confidence they have provided in granting this loan.

She lives with her husband in the La Vi\u00f1a annex, Cayalt\u00ed district, which is an hour and 50 minutes from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nShe has raised barnyard animals since she got married.  She explains that she needed to go into this business because the salary her husband earned as a field hand for an agricultural company in the area was insufficient to meet family expenses.  Income from her work through these years has been very helpful in getting her family ahead in life.\r\n\r\nJuana rasies barnyard fowl, pigs and guinea pigs to sell to merchants that visit the area where she lives.  Sometimes she sells to her neighbors as well.  She wants to increase the number of animals she raises so is asking Edpyme Alternativa for her first loan of 500 new soles.\r\n\r\nJuana wants to improve her quality of life by enlarging her business.  She is a hard-working, responsible woman, who is very dedicated to her family.  Her neighbors and acquaintances think highly of her and consider her to be an exemplary woman.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":483776,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy barnyard fowl.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"La vi\u00f1a - Nueva Arica - Chiclayo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2010-02-06T00:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":42.23},{"due_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":45.66},{"due_date":"2010-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":46.14},{"due_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":47.63},{"due_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":48.82},{"due_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":50.75},{"due_date":"2010-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":51.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":54.22},{"due_date":"2010-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":55.8},{"due_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":57.08}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.78},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.98},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.15},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.09},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.76},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.09},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.97},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.53},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.98}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":14.78,"local_amount":42.23,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:47:24Z","rounded_local_amount":42.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123900408,"comment":null},{"amount":15.98,"local_amount":45.66,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:45:40Z","rounded_local_amount":45.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128934578,"comment":null},{"amount":16.15,"local_amount":46.14,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:09:04Z","rounded_local_amount":46.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136662183,"comment":null},{"amount":16.67,"local_amount":47.63,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:07:13Z","rounded_local_amount":47.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144694886,"comment":null},{"amount":17.09,"local_amount":48.82,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:38:35Z","rounded_local_amount":48.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151877933,"comment":null},{"amount":17.76,"local_amount":50.75,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:50:54Z","rounded_local_amount":50.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159617967,"comment":null},{"amount":18.09,"local_amount":51.67,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:01:40Z","rounded_local_amount":51.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166832367,"comment":null},{"amount":58.48,"local_amount":167.1,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:56:55Z","rounded_local_amount":167.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172098985,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-02-06T01:52:20Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T09:56:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":174118,"name":"Pelagia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Pelagia es socia del Banco Comunal Granito de Mostaza.\nPelagia es casada, tiene 41 a\u00f1os y 5 hijos, Pelagia viaja a las ferias en donde compra cereales que comercializa en la ciudad de Ayacucho, en algunas oportunidades vende panes t\u00edpicos.\nPelagia necesita un pr\u00e9stamo de 1000 soles dinero que ser\u00e1 invertido en la compra de cereales.\nPelagia sue\u00f1a con que sus hijos sean profesionales.\n","en":"\r\nPelagia, 41, is a member of the Granito de Mostaza (Little Mustard Seed) communal bank.\r\nPelagia is married and has 5 children.

It is located at Hoya del R\u00edo Paute.  It enjoys a temperate climate thanks to its geographic location that is appropriate for fruit and vegetable farming.  In addition, one can enjoy the beauty of the Franciscan Sanctuary and its colonial architecture, which make it a very beautiful city.  Its residents are cordial and welcoming, receiving tourists from both home and outside the country.  \r\n\r\nThe residents are noted for being very hard-working and steadfast in their desire to succeed and provide the best for their families.  Among the residents are the following group members:\r\n\r\nRosa Ar\u00e9valo, 45, is a member of the Barrio Nuevo communal bank.  She is a very cheerful person and she cultivates a beautiful friendship with all her friends and fellow group members.  In her first relationship, she had 5 children, who range in age from 28 to 12 years.  Both her oldest daughter, who lives outside the country, and her second daughter work and contribute to pay household expenses and help pay for the educational expenses of their younger siblings.  In her new relationship, she has a 7-year-old son.  Her husband works at various trades:  driver, bricklayer, or whatever other jobs he\u2019s offered.  They still don\u2019t have their own home; they share their parents\u2019 home.\r\n\r\nRosa sells a variety of items:  paper cones of potato chips, ice-cream treats, sweets, etc.  She has been in this line of work for 30 years.  She sells these products in towns that have fiestas for one reason or another; this happens about three times a week and she tells us that she has done well and has been able, through this work, to get her family ahead in life.  She also manufactures handicrafts.\r\n\r\nThis is her third loan cycle; it was her fellow-member, Anita, who motivated her to join the communal bank.  The loans she has received have helped her with her crafts-making.  The new funds will be used to buy tables, chairs and a freezer and to pay for the lease of a locale to set up a bar.  She also wants to sell her other products and her crafts.\r\n\r\nHer greatest wish is to succeed with her businesses despite all obstacles.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":483792,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":" To buy tables, chairs and a freezer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-02-06T00:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":775,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa Alejandrina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":770,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":64.13}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":129.17,"local_amount":128.34,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:07:43Z","rounded_local_amount":129.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123910743,"comment":null},{"amount":64.59,"local_amount":64.17,"processed_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:00:20Z","rounded_local_amount":64.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128946407,"comment":null},{"amount":64.59,"local_amount":64.17,"processed_date":"2010-03-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:00:39Z","rounded_local_amount":64.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128946408,"comment":null},{"amount":143.24,"local_amount":142.32,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:18:44Z","rounded_local_amount":143.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136674719,"comment":null},{"amount":34.22,"local_amount":34,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:16:55Z","rounded_local_amount":34.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144708875,"comment":null},{"amount":274.64,"local_amount":272.87,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:46:59Z","rounded_local_amount":274.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151892178,"comment":null},{"amount":64.55,"local_amount":64.13,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:50Z","rounded_local_amount":64.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159632591,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-02-09T11:21:00Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":174123,"name":"Mari\u00e9tou","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Mar\u00e9tou W. est \u00e2g\u00e9e de 50 ans, elle et mari\u00e9e et m\u00e8re de 4 enfants en charge.

In the past, she has maintained an excellent repayment record. The loan consultant that has been working with Tatiana describes her as a hardworking entrepreneur with a fighting spirit. \r\n\r\nTatiana has a retail business in her community where she sells items such as clothing, household and health products, and facial treatments. After performing her daily domestic tasks, she dedicates six hours to her business from Monday to Saturday. Going door to door, she offers her clients various household products, clothing and cosmetics among other items. This loan will be used as working capital so she can buy clothing and facial treatment products.\r\n\r\nTatiana has been working in sales for the past ten years. In a good month, she can earn 500,000 colones; in a bad month, only 150,000. She says her main obstacle is fluctuations in demand. For example, because the schools open on February 10th, most Costa Rican families are spending money on school supplies for their children, rather than retail products. As a result, Tatiana\u2019s business takes a hit in February.\r\n\r\nIn the past, Tatiana worked as an administrative assistant while also running her sales business. Recently, she has decided to dedicate all her energy to her business, because it allows for a more flexible schedule. As her own boss, she can allocate the hours of the day she needs for domestic tasks and taking care of her children, while allotting other hours for her sales activities. \r\n\r\nTatiana hopes to combine her increased investment of time with the money from this loan to increase sales and expand her business.

She will use the profits to buy her children shoes and notebooks, to occasionally take them out to get ice cream, and to add a window to her home. Her long term goal, however, is to move her cafeteria out of her rented home to its own location, and to purchase her own home.

She lives in her own house with her husband Manuel (40) and her children; Luz(21), Liz (15) and Manuel (12).  She is an enterprising and hard working woman, and because of this, when an opportunity to start a new business presents itself, she takes it since she knows that she can accomplish anything with a lot of effort and she knows that hard work always has its reward.  Because of this, when she started selling sleepwear and polos she wasn\u2019t afraid, she is a good saleswoman and works selling her clothes to her clients on credit.  She also sells a recognized brand of beauty products and if that weren\u2019t enough, on the weekends she wakes up early to prepare tamales (a corn flour based dish) and sells them outside a bakery in the area where she lives.  She loves these three activities that she performs because they keep her occupied and they generate good earnings that allow her to help with household expenses.   For the future, she plans on installing a clothing shop in a market in her neighborhood in order to have a more stable place to sell.  This is the fourth loan she has had from MFP and she promises to be punctual with each payment when the amount is due since she would like to have access to loans in the future.  With the money that she\u2019s asking for she will buy a larger quantity of clothes in order to start selling summer clothing since she already has a lot of orders she needs to fill.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Shane Crandall, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":483905,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"Incremento de mercader\u00eda","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-02-06T18:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nelly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":600,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:25Z","rounded_local_amount":107.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123960335,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:29Z","rounded_local_amount":107.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128993183,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:38:26Z","rounded_local_amount":107.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717968,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:52Z","rounded_local_amount":107.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751644,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:52Z","rounded_local_amount":107.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151934110,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:53Z","rounded_local_amount":107.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159672885,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-02-06T20:09:27Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":174174,"name":"Marcelo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nEl Sr. Marcelo es un cliente nuevo que hace un par de a\u00f1os la Universidad Catolica le dio la oportunidad de atender la cafeteria de una de las carreras, el se\u00f1or al ver que la gran demanda de comida que existe por los estudiantes y catedraticos  decidio comprarse equipo para ofrecer comida rapida ya que por los alrededores no existe ningun lugar donde poder comer,  el se\u00f1or necesia el dinero para llenar la cafeteria con mercaderia y tambien para comprar los ingredientes para la elaboracion e pollo frito, hamburguesas y sandwichs, el Sr. Marcelo Trabaja junto con su esposa quien le ayuda en la atencion de la cafeteria.\n\nEl Sr. Marcelo esta agradecido con Emprender y Kiva por la confianza brindada en la otorgacion del credito.\n\n \t","en":"Sr. Marcelo is a new client.

Flor tells us that the idea for the business arose due to the need for an income source that allowed her and her mother to cover the family expenses. \r\n\r\nDue to the demand for her business, Flor would like to expand by buying more basic necessities and drinks but she does not have enough capital to do this. That is why she is requesting a loan from Edpyme Alternativa for 1000 nuevo soles, which will allow her to achieve her objective. \r\n\r\nFlor is a hard-working, honest woman who always tries to help her neighbors when they need it. Her greatest desire is to provide her mother with a better quality of life. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Laura Eldridge, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":483940,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy drinks and other basic necessities in order to expand her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Punto Cuatro -

Due to the fact that it is too difficult for him to take care of the family single-handedly and provide the children\u2019s basic care, and also that his wife could not do it alone, he decided to join GHAPE in 1998. Also, he has been having a lot of marital problems with his family and this has made him sad all the time, but he is appreciative of the fact that he is alive.\r\n\r\nTamumang\u2019s desire is to give his children love and education. He states that he feels better each time he provides something small for his children. His inability to get investment capital which could constantly generate income for him to meet his children\u2019s needs is what motivated him to obtain a loan from GHAPE.\r\n\r\nGiven the loan, Tamumang plans to buy a motorcycle to start a transportation business. He knows this business will succeed because he is located at a good business site and he has a good rider for the motorcycle. He plans to use the generated profits to sponsor his children in school and to cater for the basic needs of his family.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout GHAPE\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO (non-governmental organization) based in Bamenda, Cameroon. GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach. Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profit and loss, and family values.

She is married to Angoudu Emmanuel and is blessed with three children under 15. Julie is a hardworking lady who has faced many challenges in life, such as ill health and being unable to care for her children. All these challenges led her to decide to become a GHAPE member in 2008. In this same year, she received her first loan of 40,000 XAF, which she repaid promptly. \r\n<br>With this loan of 200,0000 XAF, Julie plans to buy seven tines of corn, five tines of beans, four tines of garri, and five buckets of coco yams. The loan repayment will start from the day the loan is disbursed. Julie is sure that her business will succeed because she has been doing it for a long time, has a good business location, and a lot of customers. Her neighbors are happy to buy from her because the distance they have to travel to market is reduced, and they can buy from her late at night. She plans to use her profits to invest back into the business, look after her son, and give good medical attention to herself and her children. She prefers loans from Kiva partner, GHAPE, because of the social services GHAPE offer and the convenient method of repayment.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>About GHAPE<\/b><br>\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.

Their 3 children attend school.  German and his wife have worked hard to provide a home for their children.    His wife works as a maid to help support the children, as everything is so expensive and German's salary is not enough to cover their costs.   For 8 years, he's worked as a driver for a company.  When he started out, he worked as a security guard, but later they gave him a job as a driver and a better salary.   German works for a company called Xochiquetzal, and he has to travel to many areas of the country.  With this loan, he would like to buy materials such as zinc, sand, and cement,  so that little by little, he can make repairs on their home.  It's difficult to do this work because there is not enough money.  He has benefited from the Afodenic loans, which he can pay in installments from 9 to 12 months, making it possible for him to pay the money back.  \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Emily Charnes, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":484165,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"To purchase zinc, sand and cement to make repairs on their home","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2010-02-07T05:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"German Antonio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":5000,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2010-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2010-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2010-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2010-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2010-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2010-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2010-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2010-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":555.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.77},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.77},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.78}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":29.53,"local_amount":590.64,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T07:49:45Z","rounded_local_amount":618.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128874633,"comment":null},{"amount":27.41,"local_amount":548.13,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:30:30Z","rounded_local_amount":573.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136604491,"comment":null},{"amount":27.85,"local_amount":556.97,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:30:35Z","rounded_local_amount":583.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144639960,"comment":null},{"amount":28.21,"local_amount":564.25,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:00:53Z","rounded_local_amount":590.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151821749,"comment":null},{"amount":27.89,"local_amount":557.79,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:03:59Z","rounded_local_amount":584.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159561758,"comment":null},{"amount":28.14,"local_amount":562.77,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:18:00Z","rounded_local_amount":589.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166770680,"comment":null},{"amount":28.02,"local_amount":560.3,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T07:46:38Z","rounded_local_amount":586.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172204570,"comment":null},{"amount":27.85,"local_amount":556.91,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T12:02:39Z","rounded_local_amount":583.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177330278,"comment":null},{"amount":25.1,"local_amount":502.24,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T11:42:35Z","rounded_local_amount":525.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182465445,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-02-09T00:50:54Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T11:42:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":174245,"name":"Eusebia Del Carmen","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Eusebia del Carmen L.

A. is a 35-year-old married woman who lives in Sto. Catinggib, in the village of Sua-ay, Himamaylan City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living through fish vending and hog fattening.\r\n\r\nLorena\u2019s husband works as a fisherman and helps her in running the business. They have three children who are between 2 and 15 years old. The two older children go to school and also help their parents in the business as part of their daily chores.\r\n\r\nLorena joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1999 in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve the quality of life of their family. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD she has been able to increase their family income by engaging in fish vending and hog fattening activities. Now she earns an average monthly income of Php 20,000 from her business activities.\r\n\r\nLorena is a member of good standing. Her previous loan of Php 20,000 was used to fund operations of her fish vending and hog fattening businesses and it had a positive impact on both the businesses and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is borrowing Php 20,000 for her 14th loan which she intends to use to continue sustaining her fish vending and hog fattening business activities.\r\n\r\nLorena is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which is to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":483567,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","use":"To use as

G. is a 52-year-old married woman who lives in Sto. Catinggib, Barangay Sua-aym, Himamylan City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by fish vending.\r\n\r\nLeah\u2019s husband helps her in running the business. They have four adult children, some of whom are currently going to school and also help their parents in the business as part of their daily chores.\r\n\r\nLeah joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1992 in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve the quality of life of their family. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD she has been able to increase their family income by engaging in a fish vending business. Now she earns an average monthly income of Php 21,000 from her business activities.\r\n\r\nLeah is a member of good standing. Her previous loan of Php 18,000 was used to fund operations of her fish vending business and it had a positive impact on both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is borrowing Php 18,000 for her 17th loan which she intends to use to continue supporting and sustaining her fish vending business.\r\n\r\nLeah is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which is to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

B. is a 31-year-old married woman who lives in Brgy. Culipapa, Hinoba-an, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by fishing and fish vending. Her husband, Romy, is a fisherman and Josephine sells his catch in their community and in the nearby public market. They have two children who are 12 and 13 years old and are currently going to school. \r\n\r\nJosephine joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in July, 2006, in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve the quality of life for their family.

Now she earns an average monthly income of 10,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) from her business activities.\r\n\r\nJosephine is a member in good standing. Her previous loan of 25,000 PHP was used to fund the operations of her fishing and fish vending business, and it had a positive impact on both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is applying for her 8th loan, for 25,000 PHP, which she intends to use to fund the operations of her fishing and fish vending business. Josephine is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which are to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project <i>Dungganon<\/i> (a Hiligaynon word that means <u>honorable<\/u>).

She is 46 years old and serves as the leader for this 11-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Rosalia T. Group.\r\n\r\nRosalia is married and has 2 school-aged children. Rosalia owns a general store where she sells daily use products like shampoo, soap, and toothpaste. Rosalia has been in business for over 3 years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nRosalia joined ASKI last year to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Rosalia has successfully repaid a 5,000 PHP loan from ASKI, which she used to purchase additional goods for her store. Rosalia is now requesting her second loan, in the amount of 7000 PHP, so she can buy new items for her store. She hopes to earn additional revenue so she can improve the living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk, and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1650,"image":{"id":481217,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She is 46 years old. Elena is the leader of a 3-member group loan offered by GDMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nElena is married and has 5 school-aged children. Elena owns & operates a manufacturing business. The main source of income comes from manufacturing & selling bamboo products like \"amakan\" and sticks for barbecues to local businesses and community members. Elena has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 3,500 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Elena joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Elena is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase raw materials to manufacture additional products. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Elena from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

M. is a 56-year-old married woman who lives in Prk. Malabago, Pinaginpinan, Kabankalan City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living through operating her general store and by the buying and selling of rice and corn.\r\n\r\nAlma\u2019s husband, Nelson, who is 57 years old, helps his wife in the business and also maintains a job where he earns about $226 month.  They have two children who are 28 and 32 years old and have their own families.\r\n\r\nAlma joined the Kiva field partner, NWTF-Project Dungganon, in September of 2006 in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve the quality of life of their family. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD, she has been able to increase their family income by engaging in her general store and through the buying and selling of rice and corn. Now she earns an average monthly income of $226 from her business activities.\r\n\r\nAlma is a member of good standing. Her previous loan of 18,000 PHP was used to fund the operations of her general store and the buying and selling of rice and corn.  It had a positive impact on both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now borrowing her 7th loan, in the amount of 21,000 PHP, she intends to use it on her general store and also on her business of buying and selling rice and corn. Alma is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which are to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":484388,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Now, in her 21st loan cycle, she is borrowing 20,000 PHP, which she intends to use as additional working capital.

L. is a 40-year-old married woman who lives in Sagua Banua, Valladolid, Negros Occidental. She earns her living through her photography business.\r\n\r\nRosemarie\u2019s husband, Jemmy, who is 44 years old, helps in running the business by going to different schools and by catering different occasions where video or photography is needed.  They have four children between the ages of 6  and 17 years old. The children are currently going to school and also help their parents in the business as part of their daily chores.\r\n\r\nRosemarie joined the Kiva field partner, NWTF-Project Dungganon, in 2002 in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve the quality of life of their family. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD, she has been able to increase their family income by engaging in the photography business. Now she earns an average monthly income of $203 from her business activities.\r\n\r\nShe is a member of good standing. Her previous loan of 19,000 PHP was used to fund operations for her photography business, which had a positive impact on both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now in her 14th loan cycle, Rosemarie is borrowing 20,000 PHP, which she intends to use for their photography business.  She is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which are to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":484406,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Photography","sector":"Services","use":"Additional

He is 55 years old. Rodrigo is the group leader of a 12-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Rodrigo C.'s group.\r\n\r\nRodrigo is married. To make a living, Rodrigo owns & operates a business venture in the services sector providing recycling services. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from hauling junk & other waste material for local businesses and community members. Rodrigo has been engaged in his business for over 20 years and earns approximately 6000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Rodrigo joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Rodrigo has successfully repaid a previous loan of 13000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional plastics & other recyclables to sell. Rodrigo is requesting a new loan of 15000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional waste & junk materials to sell. This loan will be the tenth loan taken out by Rodrigo from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the borrower's business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva

She earns her living by being a candy manufacturer.\r\n\r\nPaz\u2019s husband, Florentino, works as a farmer but sometimes helps out in his wife's business. They have four adult children aged between 20 and 30 with one currently going to school and they also help out in the business as part of their daily chores.\r\n\r\nPaz joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2001 in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve their family's quality of life. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD, she has been able to increase their family income by engaging in candy manufacturing. Now she earns an average monthly income of Php 32,000 from her business activities.\r\n\r\nPaz is a member of good standing. Her previous loan of Php 29,500 was used to fund the operations of her candy manufacturing and had a positive impact on both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Borrowing the amount of PHP 29,500 for her 17th loan, she intends to use the money on her candy manufacturing. Paz is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which is to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life. Paz is with her husband in the picture.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means 'honorable'). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon -a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":484389,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"For

This is a village located near the base of Mount Kanla-on, an active volcano on Negros Island.  Her home is surrounded by the expansive rice fields that support the region. Juliet is married and has one son who has graduated from college already and is working in town. She has several businesses which have helped improve her quality of life.\r\n\r\nJuliet makes her own native delicacies. In her basement, three sacks of peanuts rest against the wall. She boils and salts the peanuts and sells them in small bags. She also makes peanut butter which she sells in the market of Moises Padilla and other areas. She also makes baye-baye, a treat made from young coconut and young rice. It is originally from the town of Dumaguete in Negros Oriental but it is popular all over Negros Island.\r\n\r\nShe is going to use her loan of 20,000 pesos to buy some of the ingredients for making her native delicacies. A sack of flour costs Php 2,200, a sack of rice costs Php 1,750 and the sacks of peanuts are Php 875 apiece. She also has a piggery and pays Php 1,800 for a piglet. She has to purchase feed for fattening the piglet for sale in the market. From all of these businesses, she has an average monthly income of Php 20,000.\r\n\r\nJuliet is also going to use her loan to purchase fertilizer and insecticides for her rice farm. She has a small farm of about 1 hectare with expenses of 25,000 pesos every four months. Every harvest period, she gets 110 sacks of palay, or unmilled rice, which she can sell for 66,000 pesos.  \r\n\r\nJuliet is a member of good standing. She is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family which are to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means 'honorable'). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

in 1948, Tamumang J. is married to Nkenti Grace, and they have three children. As a man who is the bread-winner of the family and finding it very difficult to accomplish this task, he made up his mind to join GHAPE in 1998. Also, he has been having a lot of family problems. This made him sad all the time but he is appreciative of the fact that he is alive. His desire is to give his children love and education. He states that he feels better each time he provides something small to his children. His inability to get investment capital which could constantly generate income for him to meet his children\u2019s needs is what motivated him to obtain a loan from GHAPE.\r\n\r\nGiven a loan, he plans to buy a two-wheel motor cycle; he knows this business will succeed because he is located at a good business site in the metropolitan town of Bamenda and he will be the rider of the motorcycle. Believing he has good management techniques, he knows he will be able to have good monthly income from his activity.\r\n\r\nHe plans to use the profits generated to sponsor his children in school and to cater to the basic needs of his family.\r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon. GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach. Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values. Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.

She lives in Villa Reconciliaci\u00f3n where she has a small business selling clothing, shoes, towels, knitwear, earrings, barrettes etc. She\u2019s had this business for several years. She started it with the help of her husband who is a protestant pastor. He has his own income and also helps many people. \r\n\r\nAt first she had a stand in the market but later she sold it and moved her products to her house. Her home is simple: the walls need plastering; the house needs painting; and the kitchen dividing. However, she has not been able to afford these improvements as the loans she has had before have been used to buy clothing for her business. The income has been used to buy daily necessities. \r\n\r\nWith this loan Rosa will buy school uniforms such as skirts, pants, shirts, sweaters, curling irons, bags, and other items to increase her sales and attract new customers. In the longterm she wants to obtain her own place to sell clothing. The loans have been of great benefit in her personal life as a businesswoman.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jane Agg, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":484861,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy clothing etc","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2010-02-08T17:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa Adela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":10000,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2010-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2010-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2010-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2010-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2010-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2010-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2010-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1111.12}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.55},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.55},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.55},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.55},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.56}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":57.75,"local_amount":1154.91,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T07:50:05Z","rounded_local_amount":1209.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128874635,"comment":null},{"amount":57.15,"local_amount":1142.94,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:30:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1196.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136604493,"comment":null},{"amount":49.38,"local_amount":987.55,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:31:05Z","rounded_local_amount":1033.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144639963,"comment":null},{"amount":60.22,"local_amount":1204.46,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:00:29Z","rounded_local_amount":1261.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151821752,"comment":null},{"amount":55.91,"local_amount":1118.14,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:03:29Z","rounded_local_amount":1170.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159561761,"comment":null},{"amount":55.48,"local_amount":1109.7,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:17:31Z","rounded_local_amount":1161.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166770683,"comment":null},{"amount":55.8,"local_amount":1115.97,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T07:46:07Z","rounded_local_amount":1168.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172204573,"comment":null},{"amount":108.31,"local_amount":2166.33,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T12:03:33Z","rounded_local_amount":2268.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177330281,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-02-09T05:52:58Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T12:03:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":174436,"name":"Crisoslogo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Crisoslogo tiene 65 a\u00f1os, es casado, tiene seis hijos, pertenece al banco comunal \u201cYanapakuy\u201d de la Asociaci\u00f3n Arariwa (Yanapakuy es una palabra del idioma quechua que traducido al castellano significa \u201cayudemos\u201d) y tiene un peque\u00f1o negocio familiar de venta de comida.

The group includes 12 people: Marcelina G. V. and Macedonia H. sell snacks; Gudelia G. O., Evelia Enedina M. G. and Efigenia P. V. sell sweets and fried foods; Emperatriz L\u00f3pez S., Luciana Teresa L\u00f3pez M., Susana L\u00f3pez M. and Maria Eugenia L\u00f3pez H. sell beauty products such as perfumes, creams, etc. from catalogs; Antonia M. S. weaves huipiles (a traditional article of clothing); Erica Nora R. M. sells shoes from a catalog; and Lucia Matilde O. N. has a permanent store where she sells gift items. \r\n\r\nGudelia is the group's representative. She is married and has three children. Three years ago, she started a business selling sweets, and since then it has provided her with very satisfactory profits. This income has allowed her to support her children in conjunction with her husband, so that they can go to school and learn a profession. Gudelia also plans to start selling food to students and to the public in general, in hope of further increasing her income. \r\n\r\nWith the loan provided by the Realidad Foundation, she will stock her business with a greater volume of goods, and she will also purchase ingredients to prepare food to sell, such as vegetables, meat, seafood, soft drinks, coffee, sugar, eggs, tortillas, cooking oil and gas for cooking. \r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Gude, as she is called by those who know her well, is grateful for the support provided to her by the Foundation and by the other people involved in the financing, such as KIVA lenders. Her dream is to have a permanent shop where she can sell more products. She reports that she recommends her people, because she says they are responsible and dependable with their payments. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4800,"image":{"id":484899,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"Purchasing products to sell and ingredients for prepared food","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"SANTIAGO PINOTEPA NACIONAL","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2010-02-08T18:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":4800,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emperatriz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gudelia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Susana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Eugenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Antonia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Evelia Enedina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marcelina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Efigenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Macedonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Erica Nora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucia Matilde ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Luciana Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":63000,"loan_amount":4800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4500},{"due_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":4500},{"due_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":4500},{"due_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":4500},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4500},{"due_date":"2010-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":4500},{"due_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4500},{"due_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":4500},{"due_date":"2010-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":4500},{"due_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":4500},{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":4500},{"due_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":4500},{"due_date":"2010-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":4500},{"due_date":"2010-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":4500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":342.86},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":342.85},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":342.86},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":342.86},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":342.86},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":342.85},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":342.86},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":342.86},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":342.85},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":342.86},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":342.86},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":342.86},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":342.85},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":342.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1500,"local_amount":19687.5,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:15:27Z","rounded_local_amount":19745.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123916695,"comment":null},{"amount":1500,"local_amount":19687.5,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:06:13Z","rounded_local_amount":19745.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128952427,"comment":null},{"amount":600,"local_amount":7875,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:58:31Z","rounded_local_amount":7898.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136681253,"comment":null},{"amount":1200,"local_amount":15750,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:22:53Z","rounded_local_amount":15796.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144715777,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-02-09T12:27:07Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T09:22:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":174449,"name":"Festus","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Festus Irario Etiang\u2019 is a 45-year-old married man and the father of three children.

From an early age, this young man has fought to provide the best for his family.  He lives in the house he inherited from his parents with his siblings:  Alba (age 20), Carlos (age 18), Yonatan (age 15), and Paola (age 13).  He is willing to work very hard in order to fulfill his duties as the oldest brother.\r\n<p>\r\nAt the age of 16, Jhon had to confront by himself the abandonment by his parents.  Being the oldest brother, he was forced to leave high school and begin working as a tricycle driver.  This was the only way he knew to be able to feed his siblings.\r\n<p>\r\nOver time, he managed to put together enough money to buy a motorcycle taxi, which enabled his family to get ahead.  With the income he generated from this business activity, Jhon was able to pay for the college and high school expenses of his siblings.  He looks after them like a father, which is why he gains much admiration and respect.\r\n<p>\r\nWhat he enjoys most about his job is the freedom his schedule provides since he has to be aware that his siblings have everything they need.  Jhon has been in business for eight years and believes the hardest part of his job is having to work late at night.  During that time, he usually has a large amount of money that he has to take home.  With time he hopes to open a more stable business, such as a grocery store.  He is still undecided, knowing that later there will be larger expenses.\r\n<p> \r\nThis is Jhon\u2019s second loan with MFP.  He knows that he must make his payments on time and is willing to do so.  He is very responsible in his Communal Bank and does not want to lose face with the other members.  With his loan of 700 soles, he will purchase tires for his motorcycle taxi because they wear out over time. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":484943,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","use":"Puchase tires for his motorcycle taxi","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-02-08T22:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jhon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":700,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":117},{"due_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":117},{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":117},{"due_date":"2010-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":117},{"due_date":"2010-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":117},{"due_date":"2010-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":115}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.79},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.78},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.79},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.78},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.79},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.07}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":41.79,"local_amount":117,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:28Z","rounded_local_amount":119.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123960337,"comment":null},{"amount":41.78,"local_amount":117,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:23Z","rounded_local_amount":119.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128993192,"comment":null},{"amount":41.79,"local_amount":117,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:38:01Z","rounded_local_amount":119.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717974,"comment":null},{"amount":41.78,"local_amount":117,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:40:01Z","rounded_local_amount":119.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751651,"comment":null},{"amount":82.86,"local_amount":232,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:44Z","rounded_local_amount":237.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159672890,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-02-09T00:26:28Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":174465,"name":"Lorenza","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Lorenza, D. 60 a\u00f1os, es una madre D. familia muy alegre y trabajadora, vive en su casa propia junto a su esposo Paulino, D. 64 a\u00f1os, y con su hijo Heiler D. 12 a\u00f1os, quienes son el motivo D. todos sus esfuerzos.\n\nEl negocio al que se dedica es la venta D. repuestos D. segunda mano D. autom\u00f3viles, aunque sabe que es un negocio donD. predominan los varones, se siente muy segura en poder competir  sin prejuicios, es por eso que decidi\u00f3 trabajar muy duro y siente que poco a poco sus esfuerzos van dando los frutos esperados, con los cuales pueda ayudar en su hogar. \nLo que m\u00e1s le gusta D. su trabajo es vender sus repuestos, tiene 30 a\u00f1os D. experiencia y considera que lo m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil D. su trabajo es conseguir lo repuestos, ya que tiene que recorrer las calles D. la ciudad D.

wish is that her family stay together, to have employment stability, and to improve her family's living conditions to the extent that it is in her hands to do so.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

Urban areas of the Dominican Republic are highly overcrowded and can be rough, with no potable running water, frequent power outages (if one has power to begin with), and inadequate health care. Despite these difficulties, Carmen runs a successful \u201csalchicha\u201d (hot dog) stand. With this loan, she plans on purchasing more hot dogs, bread for buns, and a new stand to display the hot dogs and other sandwiches.\r\n\r\nThis is Carmen\u2019s second loan with Esperanza International, and she hopes to continue taking out loans to expand her business and improve home life for her family. With her profits, she hopes to purchase a stove for her home and some shoes and books for her children. Carmen also hopes to add some fun around the house by purchasing a pet for her kids, while also teaching them about responsibility and ownership. Carmen has high hopes for her children, and with profits from her loans, she is confident that they will receive a great education and attain a step up in their lives.\r\n\r\nEsperanza International seeks to free children and their families through initiatives that generate income, education and health, restoring self-worth and dignity to those who have lost hope. We have over 8,500 active associates in eleven offices in the Dominican Republic and Haiti.

Every eight days, she travels to San Vito de Coto Brus in order to purchase supplies from the factory. She purchases large bags of feed weighing 23 or 46 kilograms. By separating it into smaller one kilogram bags, she is able to offer her clients a choice to purchase large or small amounts of feed.\r\n\r\nMarta\u00b4s store is the only authorized distributor in Golfito for products produced by the supplier in San Vito (a relationship which has been guaranteed not to change).\r\n\r\nMarta plans to use this loan to pay off outstanding debts she holds with feed suppliers.

Josephine has been in her business for over three years and earns approximately 5,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Josephine joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living conditions and enable her to engage in business activities. Josephine has successfully repaid a previous loan of 18,000 PHP from ASKI which was used to purchase products to sell. Josephine is requesting a new loan of 22,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be her seventh loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nJosephine is the leader of a 12 member group accessing a loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members, if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is \"Josephine P.\".\r\n\r\n<b>About ASKI:<\/b>\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

When she started, she only had 1.5 million Tugrugs. Now the business is worth 5.5 million. Once a month, Enhgerel gets new products from Beijing. Because she only buys high-quality products and receives them from Beijing, the clothes she offers are usually better than those offered by the other sellers.  \r\n\r\nEnhgerel needs a loan so she can purchase more apparel from Beijing. Her goal is eventually to have enough money to embark upon her real dream job: opening her very own pastry bakery and shop.  \r\n\r\nHer husband, Enhbayar, was crew foreman until an accident at work punctured one of his eardrums and left him partially deaf, a condition that persists even after attempts to have it corrected.  He now works as a delivery man for the vendors in town. \r\n\r\nEnhgerel and Enhbayar live with their children in their own ger (a Mongolian felt tent lived in by nomads). They have twins, Tseveenjav and Tseveensuren, age 16, and a son, Arvinbileg, age 10.

The citizens of this town are hardworking people and most of them have their own livestock and work in the fields.\r\n\r\nOne of these citizens is Jumabubu O. a sixty-one-year-old widow who brought up five children: three of them are daughters and two are sons and now all live separately with their husbands and wives.\r\n\r\nJumabubu\u2019s husband was also hardworking and they bought a cow with their savings. Later on they sold it and bought two cows with the proceeds. Unfortunately, as life is an unpredictable thing, her husband died from a heart attack, leaving all his children and the little farm on Jumabubu\u2019s brittle shoulders.\r\n\r\nNowadays, Jumabubu is a caring grandmother who has her little farm. She does animal husbandry and sells milk and also rears cattle. She has expanded her livestock and has already married off her children. Now she wants to marry off her grandchildren as well.\r\n\r\nThirty years ago, nobody thought that this family, with 15,000 soms ($340) in their pocket, would succeed one day, especially after their grief, but they did. Now her profit is 11,500 soms ($262).\r\n\r\nJumabubu wants to obtain a loan to buy ten sheep to raise and sell.\r\n\r\nGulnara S. is forty and is married with four children: two sons and two daughters. Her elder children attend the local school and the younger one is a preschooler. She wants to give a high level of education to her children and to buy a big house as well. Her husband transports passengers.\r\n\r\nNow, Gulnara sells milk and breeds cattle. Everything started with 10,000 soms ($228) which they got from selling their harvest and which they used to buy a cow. Now they already bought a car, a tractor and have increased their head of livestock. With the loan they will buy a heifer to raise.\r\n\r\nKuldjamilya K. is a fifty-four-year-old widow who has three daughters and a son. Her elder daughters are married and live separately; her younger daughter works in the shop and her son is busy about the house. Her children already received an education.\r\n\r\nKuldjamilya is a seamstress, making national garments. About forty years ago for cost of about 5,000 soms ($114) she and her husband bought a heifer. Now, from selling milk and other items, they earn 2,100 soms ($43) per month. They are planning to increase their head of livestock and to build a barn and a fence. The loan will be used to buy a heifer to raise.\r\n\r\nArsygulbek M. is a married man at the age of forty nine. He has five children to whom he wants to give a good education and he also wants to buy a house. Three of his children are sons and two are daughters. His spouse is a housewife. His elder daughter is married, the second one works in the garment factory, his son is busy about the house and the youngest ones go to the local school.\r\n\r\nArsygulbek\u2019s wife and son always help and encourage him. They sell milk and look after cattle while he works as a taxi driver. A few years ago they bought a cow for 12,000 ($273) and thus they started their business. Now their profit is 8,400 soms ($190) per month. Arsygulbek wants to obtain a loan to increase the total number of their cattle.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>======================================\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---<\/b>\r\n<br>This loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n<br>Mol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of the 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable in order to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

O. is 59 years old and lives in La Castellana, Negros Occidental. She is a widow and has been caring for her two children since 1985. She makes her living by selling soft drinks and frozen foods in the local markets. She is also a rice retailer - buying and selling sacks of rice. With her food business, she gets contracts from Iloilo in the province of Panay to the north of Negros Occidental.\n\nBefore joining Project Dungganon in 2002, Corazon sold products door-to-door, including ready-to-wear (used) clothing and Avon beauty products. With her loan from Project Dungganon, she was able to expand her frozen foods business and eventually move into the rice dealing business. Her current loan of 15,000 pesos will be beneficial in making investments in her business.\n\nCorazon has a son and a daughter who have both graduated from college and are off on their own. She is incredibly proud of their achievements since they both chose to become public servants. Her daughter is a teacher in the national high school and her son is a policeman. Corazon has a 3-month-old grandson with her son.\n\nEventually, Corazon plans to move out from her present house and settle down in one of the nicer subdivisions. She has already bought a plot of land but cannot afford to build a home yet. She needs Php 100,000 \u2013 about $2,500 \u2013 to build a house. One day she will get that home while still being a member of Project Dungganon.\n\nCorazon is a member of good standing. She is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family which is to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\n\n\n About NWTF:\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":482320,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","use":"To use as

a 45-year old married woman from a barangay (district) called Manghanoy in La Castellana. She is married and has four children between the ages of 6 and 21. She is a very busy woman, acting as an entrepreneur and member of Project Dungganon as well as the treasurer of her barangay.\n\nLuzviminda runs several businesses like a pig-fattening operation and a rice-retailing business. Using her loan from Project Dungganon (NWTF\u2019s micro-finance division), she is going to purchase more rice to resell. She buys approximately twenty-five sacks of rice at a time, at approximately 1,500 pesos per sack. She is able to sell them for 1,700 to the community, for a profit of 5,000 pesos for each set of twenty-five.\n\nOne major problem is that sometimes the creditors don\u2019t remember to pay their debts, which means Luzviminda has to wait. More often than not she is paid for her wares, though it can be a struggle. Eventually she would like to own a parcel of land of her own. Manghanoy is a good area for farming, with rich soil.\n\nOne of Luzviminda\u2019s children just graduated from college and is looking for a job.  Luzviminda has job working as a treasurer, handling the distribution of the government money for her community. She has to go to the barangay hall every day to work with the barangay officials in handling the finances, keeping records, writing reports, etc. She is compensated at 6,000 pesos per month, and is certainly earning it with all of the work she is putting in. During the day, her husband helps to take care of her piggery.\n\nLuzviminda is a member of good standing. She is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family which are to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\n\n\n About NWTF:\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":481872,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","use":"To use as

However, after both her and her husband were fired from their highly paid jobs, they both faced many difficulties. They had to do something to survive and move on. Understanding their troubles, Kalbubu's parents gave them a cow. This was the first step in making their life better. Ten years ago, after receiving that great \u201cgift\u201d, they started a business milking the cow and selling the milk. Day by day, the family's budget increased.

The younger child is 14 and goes to the local school \u2013 he is a smart and hardworking boy who helps his parents with the chores. Together, the family raise cattle and Kalbubu's husband does a portage. Their profit in total is 11,500 KGS. At the moment, they are planning to renovate their house.

She earns 7,000 KGS per month and is requesting a loan to buy calves for fattening and selling on.           \r\n<br>Jibek M. is 37, widowed, and has three children. Her eldest son is 18 and has already graduated from a specialized school, her daughter is 16 and attends college, and her youngest son is 11 and goes to school. Her revenue from selling provisions is 7,000 KGS per month. However, she did not think that from selling a cow last year for 15,000 KGS, she would start a really good business. She is planning to help her children find jobs and save up some money for their marriages. She is requesting a loan to buy goods to increase turnover and the variety of goods she offers.\r\n<br>Oksana K. is 32 and married to a man who works in distillery as a mason. She has two daughters; the elder is 11 and the younger is 7. They both go to school. Oksana has an animal breeding business, fattening both sheep and bull-calves and then selling them. With a loan and initial capital of 100,000 KGS about 8 years ago, her revenue is now 9,500 KGS. She has bought a car and is planning to replace it in the future, and also wants to build a new house. She is requesting another loan to buy bull-calves for fattening and selling.\r\n<p>\r\n<br>Where did this loan come from?<\/b><br>\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.
