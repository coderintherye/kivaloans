Ram\u00edrez is 41 years old and married.  She lives in the San Miguel Xico settlement, which is in the Chalco Solidaridad Valley in the state of M\u00e9xico.  She has four children; two of them are school age.  Her husband is a bricklayer.  To get other income she started working with another woman selling snacks.  At that time this really helped because her earnings helped her husband with the school expenses for her children.  It seemed that all was well.  \r\n\r\nIn time she started to feel bad, and she went to the doctor.  They told her that she has a severe infection that is affecting her kidneys, and she needed to be in treatment.  Not having medical insurance, the costs elevated.  She did not have economic resources, so she looked for medical alternatives.  It was this activity that helped in the recovery of her health as much as economically.  A relative lent her a little money, which served as her first investment.  Then she got customers.  Now she needs money to be able to increase her investment.

Combining twenty years of work with preschool children and with a background in competitive gymnastics, ballet, modern dance, theater and horse-vaulting at an international level, it is not surprising that June has seen her business triple since it started in November of 2008.\r\n\r\nTo accommodate her growing client base, June needed to expand her gym into a larger space. A friend from Wells Fargo, who was frustrated that she was unable to help due to the tighter loan qualifying criteria set by banks, referred June to Opportunity Fund.\r\n\r\nWith this loan June will be able to create a safety wall, install netting around the trampoline area, and buy new gym equipment to ensure the gym continues to be a fun, educational, and safe environment. In addition, June will be able to purchase a computer to accommodate new gym software to help grow the business, and contract a bookkeeper to help establish a better budgeting and record-keeping system.\r\n\r\nWith the expansion of her gym and just one semester left to earn her degree in Early Childhood Education, June is close to fulfilling a lifelong dream of owning a preschool-gym business. \u201cMy family especially thinks that this has changed me a lot.

They live mostly in traditional extended families in the Guegn\u00e9ka district of Fana, in the Dioila prefecture, in the second administrative region of the republic.  \r\n\r\nThese women mainly buy and sell clothing, bed linens and bed spreads.  After having properly repaid the four preceding loans, the women of the Benkadi group are on their fifth joint loan which will be used to buy packages of different types of clothing for men, women and children. They mostly get their supplies from wholesalers in Burkina Faso and Bamako, making their sales door to door and at market, with cash and credit, to a clientele of men and women.  They each expect to earn a monthly profit of 50,000 FCFA which will be used to meet the needs of their families, and to invest the rest in their business.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Shannon Arnold, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":489903,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to purchase clothing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Bougouni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.416667 -7.483333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-02-20T01:50:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aramatou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marama ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Magnini ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fanta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Payi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-13T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":175,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2010-03-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:59:59Z","rounded_local_amount":84255.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129021664,"comment":null},{"amount":175,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:15:08Z","rounded_local_amount":84255.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136746453,"comment":null},{"amount":175,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:21Z","rounded_local_amount":84255.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144778990,"comment":null},{"amount":175,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:16:57Z","rounded_local_amount":84255.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151961197,"comment":null},{"amount":175,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:46Z","rounded_local_amount":84255.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159699361,"comment":null},{"amount":175,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:58:06Z","rounded_local_amount":84255.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166913289,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-02-20T17:07:31Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:58:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":176681,"name":"Maria Del Rosario","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"do\u00f1a Maria del Rosario F. es una mujer emprendedora y bien dedicada a su trabajo. es madre de 2 hijos.\ntodos los dias se lavanta a las 5 de la ma\u00f1ana para atender a su clientela. \ntiene bastantes clientes porque donde esta ubicado su negocio transita mucha gente a diario.\nesta solicitando el credito para surtir mas su negocio y hacerlo crecer mas.\nse siente muy feliz ya que cuando comenzo tenia poco inventario y ahora es una pulperia bien surtida. su meta es hacerlo crecer mas y mas cada dia que pasa.\nlas ganancias las ocupa para mantener su hogar y darles una mejor calidad de vida a sus hijos.\n","en":"Maria del Rosario F. is an enterprising woman who is very dedicated to her work.

From then on she returned to the pharmacy to keep helping her husband.\r\n\r\nNow, with the experience she has gained, she plans to reopen her business.

Juan is retired and receives a pension that fails to support the needs of the family.  For this reason Adela decided 9 years ago to start her own business.  Speaking with some professors of the National Educational Center of the municipality in which she lives, she was permitted to open a cafe there in which she began distributing to her clients foods like nachos and chips, pupusas (a biscuit-like flat bread made from maize) in the morning, natural refreshments and a good variety of delicacies for children and youths of the educational center.  Maria Adela has worked hard to make her business prosper and thanks to her effort this has been possible.  Now she has decided to pursue a new idea, that of offering lunches both to the professors and students of the school.  This has gone over very well.  Her clientele is growing, given that they recognize that her culinary tastes are exquisite as well as appreciating the amiability of Adela, her husband and her children and the cleanliness of the place.

She completed 8th grade, is a housewife and has three children (one boy and 2 girls).  She has raised small farm animals like, lambs and calves, for five years.  She is asking for funding to buy animals.  At the moment of asking for the loan she is happy because she sees an opportunity to continue growing with her business and becoming financially solvent.  She hopes to be able to help her children become educated, since she did not have the opportunity to continue with her schooling due to her parent\u2019s inability to provide her with that help.\r\n\r\nShe wants the funds to buy feed for her animals.  Part of the money will be used to farm her lands in order to have corn and grass to feed her animals.  She hopes to sell them at a good price and, with help from future loans, buy more heads of cattle until having a considerable amount that will permit her to have an additional business consisting of animal pelt sales.  She also hopes that she will make enough income to build a more comfortable house for her family and, if possible, see to her children become professionals.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

Their father is a shopkeeper.  They live in a semi urban area of the Ereguayquin municipality, in the Usulutan department.  Several years ago, Teresa, realizing that the income from her husband's business was not enough to cover the costs of her home, decided to help him and installed a grain grinder in her home.  She uses it to grind corn, beans, cracklings, yucca, flour among other things.  Several months ago, seeing that the frequency of her customers has diminished due to competition, Teresa decided to set times where she and her husband are at the grinder and otherwise she goes to sell clothing door to door in the adjoining communities or at the regional market of the municipality.  Teresa has found another good source of income for her family in the sale of this clothing and is now wanting to purchase a bigger variety of products thus increasing her sales and her profits.<br

The members reside in the city of Urubamba, Cusco department; a city that is noted for its beautiful scenery, its agriculture and its cattle raising.\r\n\r\nThe members are engaged in various commercial activities such as:  vegetable sales, food and prepared meals sales.  Some members sell cell phone cards, some provide urban transportation services, shoe store, home construction, office cleaning services.  The members who have businesses are worried because sales have dropped. The heavy rains that fell on Cusco for three days caused many tourists to cancel their travel plans to Cusco.  Tourism has declined considerably.\r\n\r\nRosa is a member of the Los Emprendedores communal bank.  She is 19 years old, lives with her life partner and has a daughter, Yudith, who is 10 months old.

Manis Kasih was originally formed out of the initiative of mothers who, at the time, found it very difficult to obtain loans to develop their businesses. Local banks had numerous requirements that were quite burdensome to the women and thus made it difficult to secure loans. This group was formed to make loans more accessible to the women in the region and, with its continued growth, became a legal entity in Bali in 2007.\r\n\r\nAt this time, Manis Kasih Women\u2019s Cooperative has 126 members, all of whom are mothers of children of various ages. The group is located in a rural region of Bali, thus the majority of the women utilizing these loans work in agriculture as farmers, breeders or traders. Other women own small shops that sell daily goods such as rice, soap, etc. In this group there are also a few tailors and chocolate traders who will receive loans.\r\n \r\nTo meet the needs of its members and allow them to expand their businesses, Manis Kasih Women\u2019s Cooperative is working with Koperasi Mitra Usaha Kecil (MUK) and Kiva to receive a loan fund that will be managed by the group leadership in accordance with the rules the members have established.\r\n\r\nThe leadership team pictured here will receive this loan and will distribute it to a group of approximately forty women who are all members of Manis Kasih. The loan money will allow the women to expand their respective businesses by buying new livestock, food or supplies for their animals, or by buying items to sell in their stores.\r\n\r\nThis subset of the Manis Kasih is headed by Ni Putu B. and they have requested a loan in the amount of 25,000,000 IDR. Ni Putu B. is a chocolate merchant. As the wife of a farmer, she chooses to not stay at home quietly, simply relying on her husband\u2019s income. Instead, she searches for additional family income by riding on her motorcycle around the village each day to buy local crops such as coconuts, bananas and chocolate that she can sell in markets in neighboring regions. With her profits from this venture she supplements her husband\u2019s income primarily to pay the school fees of her two young children.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Note to Kiva Lenders: <\/b> \r\nThis group uses a community lending model (commonly referred to as Village Banking) that is very common throughout Asia. In this model, a select number of group representatives will take out a large loan on behalf of their entire group (often an entire village). They will then distribute and manage the loan and collect repayments for the lender.\r\n\r\nThis is a common and efficient practice in the region, but it makes reporting on Kiva somewhat unusual. Unlike most other loans, Kiva\u2019s partner, MUK, will be in contact primarily with the group leadership team who in turn will be overseeing the end borrowers. As such, journal updates likely will reflect the performance of the lending group rather than the individual end borrowers.\r\n \r\nTo learn more about Village Banking on Wikipedia, please click <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Village_Banking\" TARGET=\"_new\">here<\/a>.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2675,"image":{"id":490022,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"To buy more local crops such as coconuts, bananas and chocolate","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2010-02-17T17:00:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Putu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Luh ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Ketut ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Luh ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Komang ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Kadek ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Kadek ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":25000000,"loan_amount":2675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":25000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2675}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":2675,"local_amount":25000000,"processed_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:48:05Z","rounded_local_amount":25011250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195878554,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-02-18T10:24:02Z","paid_date":"2011-03-24T08:48:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":4,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":176723,"name":"Manis Kasih Women\u2019S Cooperative (Group A)","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Manis Kasih Women\u2019s Cooperative (Sweet Love) is a village banking organization located in Manistutu village near the town of Melaya in northwest Bali.

Other women own small shops that sell daily goods such as rice, soap, etc.\r\n\r\nTo meet the needs of its members and allow them to expand their businesses, Manis Kasih Women\u2019s Cooperative is working with Koperasi Mitra Usaha Kecil (MUK) and Kiva to receive a loan fund that will be managed by the group leadership in accordance with the rules the members have established.\r\n\r\nThe leadership team pictured here will receive this loan and will distribute it to a group of approximately forty women who are all members of Manis Kasih. The loan money will allow the women to expand their respective businesses by buying new livestock, food or supplies for their animals, or by buying items to sell in their stores.\r\n\r\nThis subset of the group is headed by Ni Wayan W. and they have requested a loan of  25,000,000 IDR. Ni Wayan W. will be using her portion of the loan for her cattle business. She cares for cattle that belong to others and is then paid a yearly salary above her expenses.\r\n  \r\n\r\n<b>Note to Kiva Lenders: <\/b> \r\nThis group uses a community lending model (commonly referred to as Village Banking) that is very common throughout Asia. In this model, a select number of group representatives will take out a large loan on behalf of their entire group (often an entire village). They will then distribute and manage the loan and collect repayments for the lender.\r\n\r\nThis is a common and efficient practice in the region, but it makes reporting on Kiva somewhat unusual. Unlike most other loans, Kiva\u2019s partner, MUK, will be in contact primarily with the group leadership team who in turn will be overseeing the end borrowers. As such, journal updates likely will reflect the performance of the lending group rather than the individual end borrowers.\r\n \r\nTo learn more about Village Banking on Wikipedia, please click <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Village_Banking\" TARGET=\"_new\">here<\/a>.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2675,"image":{"id":490017,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To use as additional capital for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2010-02-17T17:40:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Wayan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Komang ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sayu ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Si Luh ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Luh ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Luh ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Luh ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":25000000,"loan_amount":2675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":25000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2675}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":2675,"local_amount":25000000,"processed_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:48:05Z","rounded_local_amount":25011250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195878555,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-02-18T18:02:44Z","paid_date":"2011-03-24T08:48:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":176724,"name":"Pit","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Pit D., aged 26, is married and lives with her husband in Takeo province, Cambodia.

Manis Kasih was originally formed out of the initiative of mothers who, at the time, found it very difficult to obtain loans to develop their businesses. Local banks had numerous requirements that were quite burdensome to the women and thus made it difficult to secure loans. This group was formed to make loans more accessible to women in the region and, given its continued growth, became a legal entity in Bali in 2007. \r\n<br>At this time, Manis Kasih Women\u2019s Cooperative has 126 members, all of whom are mothers of children of various ages. The group is located in a rural region of Bali, thus the majority of the women utilizing these loans work in agriculture as farmers, breeders or traders. Other women own small shops that sell daily goods such as rice, soap, etc. In this group, there are also a few women who harvest rice and one woman who makes cakes. \r\n<br>To meet the needs of its members and allow them to expand their businesses, Manis Kasih Women\u2019s Cooperative is working with Mitra Usaha Kecil Koperasi (MUK) and Kiva to receive a loan fund that will be managed by group leadership in accordance with the rules the members have established. The leadership team pictured here will receive this loan and distribute it to a group of approximately 45 women who are all members of Manis Kasih. The loan money will allow the women to expand their respective businesses by buying new livestock, food or supplies for their animals, or by buying items to sell in their stores.\r\n<br>This subset of the Manis Kasih is headed by Ni Ketut G.. The group has requested a loan of 30,000,000 IDR. Ni Ketut G. manages a small shop in front of her home. Although her husband has a steady job in his village as an officer, Ni Ketut G. does not rely on her husband's fixed income. At the shop in front of her home, she sells all kinds of daily necessities such as rice, oil, writing equipment and various cakes and snacks. She is using her portion of the loan to purchase additional merchandise that she is lacking. This will help Ni Ketut G. earn extra income to supplement her husband's earnings.  \r\n<p>\r\n<b>Note to Kiva lenders<\/b><br>\r\nThis group uses a community lending model (commonly referred to as Village Banking) that is very common throughout Asia.

They will then distribute and manage the loan and collect repayments for the lender. This is a common and efficient practice in the region, but it makes reporting on Kiva somewhat unusual. Unlike most other loans, Kiva\u2019s partner MUK will be in contact primarily with the group leadership team who in turn will be overseeing the end borrowers.

A. is 40 and married with 6 children (ages 2 - 20).  She owns a business venture, catching & selling ocean-caught fish .  Aofa has 3 years of experience in this business.  Aofa needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase fishing equipment including hooks & nets.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 400 tala or US $167 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Aofa joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Aofa's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Aofa A. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.3 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.4 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.5 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress.  The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation.  A higher number represents a higher score.  For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.  \r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\"\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.  \r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting bananas for sale.  Meleseke has 3 years of experience in this business.  Meleseke needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase general farm supplies & equipment.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 380 tala or US $158 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Meleseke joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Meleseke's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Meleseke P. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.3 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.4 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.5 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\"\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

 T. is 38 and married with 5 children (ages 3 - 15).  She owns a business venture, selling ice-cakes (flavored ice in styrofoam cups).  Osana  has 3 years of experience in this business.  Osana  needs a loan of WST $1500 to buy sugar, styrofoam cups, and codial (flavoring).  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 280 tala or US $117 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Osana  joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Osana 's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Osana  T. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.3 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.3 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\"\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

SPBD's loans are Vagana's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Vagana Pilato are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                2 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\"\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.

P. is 39 and married with 3 children (ages 2 - 6).  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Vagana has 4 years of experience in this business.  Vagana needs a loan of WST $2900 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 tala or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\n\nThis is Vagana's 5th loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Vagana's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\n\nThe following social metrics for Vagana P. are provided by SPBD*:\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\nLevel of Education:                              1.3 out of 3\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.3 out of 3\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.5 out of 3\n\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\n\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\"\n\nAbout SPBD\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\n\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

V. is 37 and married with 4 children (ages 1 - 12).  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Sina has 3 years of experience in this business.  Sina needs a loan of WST $2250 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 tala or US $188 per week) to improve\/expand the business.  This is her 3rd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Sina's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Sina V. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.3 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.3 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.4 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\"\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

S. is 34 and married with 2 children (ages 1 and 3).  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Asotasi has 4 years of experience in this business.  Asotasi needs a loan of WST $1700 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 400 tala or US $167 per week) to improve\/expand the business. This is her 3rd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Asotasi's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Asotasi S. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.3 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.3 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.3 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.4 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\"\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

Faleilua is 35 and married with 5 children (ages 2 - 6).  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Faaoloviti has 5 years of experience in this business.  Faaoloviti needs a loan of WST $1750 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 400 tala or US $167 per week) to improve\/expand the business. This is her 3rd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Faaoloviti's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nYou can view pictures of a typical plantation in Samoa, taken by a Kiva Fellow, at:   http:\/\/picasaweb.google.com\/agnes.p.chu\/SamoanPlantation\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Faaoloviti Faleilua are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.3 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.3 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\"\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

S. is 48 and married with 5 children (ages 6 - 15).  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Talosia has 4 years of experience in this business.  Talosia needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 tala or US $188 per week) to improve\/expand the business.  This is her 3rd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Talosia's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Talosia S. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.3 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.6 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.5 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\"\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 350 tala or US $146 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Tuise joined SPBD.  This is his 1st loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Tuise's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Tuise F. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.2 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.3 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.4 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.5 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\"\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.

F. is 38 and married with 3 children (ages 1 - 5).  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Rosina has 1 year of experience in this business.  Rosina needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 tala or US $188 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\n\nIn 2010, Rosina joined SPBD.    This is her 1st loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Rosina's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\n\nAbout SPBD\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\n\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 tala or US $188 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Fipe joined SPBD.  This is her 1st loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Fipe's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Fipe F. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.3 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.4 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.5 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\"\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

S. is 50 and married with 8 children (ages 12 - 28).  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Ioe has 4 years of experience in this business.  Ioe needs a loan of WST $1800 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 tala or US $188 per week) to improve\/expand the business.  This is her 4th loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Ioe's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\n\nThe following social metrics for Ioe S. are provided by SPBD*:\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.3 out of 3\nLevel of Education:                              1.4 out of 3\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.4 out of 3\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.3 out of 3\n\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\n\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\"\n\nAbout SPBD\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\n\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

K. is 38 and married with 2 children (ages 3-months and 7).  She owns a business venture, selling food products in the local community.  Faapo has 2 years of experience in this business.  Faapo needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase additional products to sell.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 800 tala or US $333 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Faapo joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Faapo's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Faapo K. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\"\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

V. is 44 years old. He lives with his wife, who works around the house, and with his 2 daughters, 14 and 4 years of age, who both study. Pedro resides in Sacacoyo, located in La Libertad department, a place where he has his own business selling grocery products and necessary household items. Several years ago Pedro decided to start his own business, owing to the neeed to have a stream of revenue, since he didn't have a job. In the face of this difficult situation he decided not to cross his arms and do nothing and began buying some grocery items to sell at his home. In this way, little by little, he began stocking his business. Although Pedro has steady customers he hasn't been able to supply the shop with all that his customers ask of him. It is for this reason that he is seeking a loan, with the aim of being able to increase his inventory, purchasing products such as milk, cold meats, bread and other things, which will increase his sales and allow Pedro to give a better life to his family. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jane McCrory, Kiva

Indah (Group A)","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The Cendana Indah Group A comprises 15 women from the Kaliakah Village near the town of Melaya in northwest Bali. These women manage various businesses ranging from shop traders, to cattle and pig farmers, to produce sellers. \r\n\r\nThe group, which is led by a chairwoman and treasurer (pictured above) requested a loan of Rp. 10,000,000 which will be distributed to group members according to their individual needs and business skills. The chairwoman of the group is responsible for the borrowing of all the members and for assuring that the money is shared equally in accordance with their business needs. At the end of the loan period, the chairwoman and treasurer will collect the repayments from each member in a group meeting.\r\n\r\nOne member of this group is Ni Luh B.. Ni Luh B. owns a shop where she sells chicken soup, beef meatballs, and various kinds of cakes and soft drinks. Her portion of the loan is approximately Rp. 500,000. She will use her loan to buy a glass shelf and stall equipment to make her restaurant kiosk look more attractive. Her daily revenue from her business ranges from Rp. 30,000-50,000. Profits from her store go to pay for school fees for her two children, who are currently in elementary and junior high school.\r\n\r\nNote to Kiva Lenders: This group uses a community lending model commonly referred to as \"village banking\" that is very common throughout Asia. In this model, a select number of group representatives borrow a large loan on behalf of their entire group, often an entire village. They will then distribute and manage the loan and collect repayments for the lender. This is a common and efficient practice in the region, but it makes reporting on Kiva somewhat unusual. Unlike most other loans, Kiva\u2019s partner MUK will be in contact primarily with the group leadership team, who in turn will be overseeing the end borrowers. As such, journal updates likely will reflect the performance of the lending group rather than the individual borrowers.   \r\n \r\nTo learn more about village banking, see this Wikipedia article: Village Banking.

J. is 30 years old and a resident of the Department of Ahuachap\u00e1n.  She lives with her husband, who is a construction worker, and their two dependent children who are studying in a basic education program at the local school.  Rosa started selling tortillas two years out of family necessity.  She decided that she should help her husband with covering their household expenses.  \r\n<p>\r\nRosa makes and sells tortillas at noon and in the evenings.  She has the advantage of being the only tortilla stand in her neighborhood.  Rosa has been able to build a very stable business that generates good revenues.  For this reason, she is requesting a loan so that she can buy corn in bulk so that she can serve more customers and generate a better income.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica,

At the end of the loan period, the chairwoman and treasurer will collect the repayments from each member in a group meeting.\r\n\r\nOne of the members of the group is Ni Komang Karleni who has a business in the school cafeteria. Her portion of this loan is Rp. 350,000 which will be used to buy foods that are sold such as rice packets, fried noodles, chicken soup, porridge, various snack foods and soft drinks. Each day she begins selling at 6 a.m. Her clients are mostly school children, but also people from the area. Her efforts are in demand because her food is very good and cheap.\r\n\r\nNi Komang Karleni\u2019s income per day is approximately Rp. 60,000. Her income goes towards capital for her shop, everyday needs, and personal savings. She was only educated through junior high school level so she wants her son to be able to attend school up to university level so he can improve his life.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote to Kiva Lenders:  \r\nThis group uses a community lending model (commonly referred to as Village Banking) that is very common throughout Asia. In this model, a select number of group representatives will take out a large loan on behalf of their entire group (often an entire village). They will then distribute and manage the loan and collect repayments for the lender.\r\n\r\nThis is a common and efficient practice in the region, but it makes reporting on Kiva somewhat unusual. Unlike most other loans, Kiva\u2019s partner, MUK, will be in contact primarily with the group leadership team who in turn will be overseeing the end borrowers. As such, journal updates likely will reflect the performance of the lending group rather than the individual end borrowers.\r\n \r\nTo learn more about Village Banking on Wikipedia, please click here.\r\n"}},"status":"deleted","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":490115,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"To buy foods that are sold in her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Komang","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Ketut","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Komang","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Ketut","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Ketut","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Wayan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Ketut","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni  Luh","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Putu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Nyoman","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Nengah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Luh","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Ketut","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ketut ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Putu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":9999990,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":9999990}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1075}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":176777,"name":"Ponchita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ponchita U. is a 51-year-old mother who always dreamed of happiness for her family.

She is 44 years old. Lucena is the group leader for a three-member group loan offered by PMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n<p>\r\nLucena is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Lucena owns and operates a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap, and toothpaste in the local community. Lucena has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 1,500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2009, Lucena joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Lucena has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory and working capital. Lucena is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Lucena from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support her immediate family. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n<p>\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

F., 41, is making sure that her family has enough provisions for their daily needs. She is blessed with four children. She makes sure that she earns well so that her family can have a better life. She has been managing her own mineral water refilling station and food stall, where her main product is breakfast fare.\n\nMinerva has been a regular member of Center for Community Transformation* (CCT) for more than a year now. She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she was able to borrow seven times in CCT\u2019s Cooperative. She is consistent in paying her dues because she used the money she borrowed to expand and improve her food business.     \n\nNow, with your help, she would like to apply for a PHP 13,000 loan. This amount will be used as a source of added capital to her expanding business by refilling mineral water containers and buying supplies needed for her business.\n\nShe dreams that her business will continue to grow, enabling her to save enough for her children\u2019s education and proper health and nutritional needs. She has always dreamed of having her own restaurant in the near future too.\n\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and pay microfinance loans.\n\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":490154,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"Refilling

To make a living, she owns and operates a general store that sells a variety of products in the local community. Ma. Lourdes is just starting this business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Ma. Lourdes joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Having fully repaid a previous loan of 15000 PHP from PMPC that was used to purchase additional products to sell, she is now requesting a new loan of 15000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. This loan will be her third from PMPC, and she plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her child. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

O., 37 years old, is from Nyalenda town in Kisumu city. He is married to Pamela Anyango, who is a charcoal dealer, and they have four children. Their eldest child is 13 years old and has just joined high school, while the last-born is 6 years old and in primary school.\r\n\r\nJoseph is a carpenter. He has been in this business for the last 12 years. He is currently looking for lenders to fund him through Kadet Limited so that he can add more stock to his business, i.e. timber, nails, boards and wires.

A. is a 62-year-old married woman who lives in Nabantu-an, Escalante City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating a general store. Nieves\u2019s husband, Victoriano, is 61 years old and helps his wife run the store.  They have seven children between 28 and 45 years old. Some of the children are married with children of their own and most are working.\r\n\r\nNieves joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1984 in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve the quality of life for their family. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD, she has been able to increase their family income with her general store. Now she earns an average monthly income of 8,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) from her business activities.\r\n\r\nNieves is a member in good standing. Her previous loan of 19,000 PHP was used to fund the operations of her general store, and it had a positive impact on both the business and her family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is requesting her 20th loan, in the amount of 19,500 PHP, which she intends to use as additional capital for her general store. Nieves is working hard to achieve her dream for her family which is to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project <i>Dungganon<\/i> (a Hiligaynon word that means <u>honorable<\/u>).

M. is a 49-year-old married woman living in Brgy. Quezon, San Carlos City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by planting rice and vegetables for sale.\r\n\r\nDiosdada\u2019s husband, Protacio, is 48 years old and makes his living as a farmer. They have eight children between the ages of 5 and 26 years old. Three of her children already have families of their own and the other five are in her custody. Some of her children are currently going to school and also helping their parents in the business as part of their daily chores.\r\n\r\nDiosdada joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 with the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve the quality of life of their family. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD, she has been able to increase their family income and earns an average monthly income of 4,000 Philippine pesos from her business activities.\r\n\r\nDiosdada is a member in good standing. Her previous loan of Php 11,000 was used to fund operations of her rice and vegetables plantation, and it had a positive impact on both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is borrowing, for her 11th loan, the amount of Php 12,000 to buy fertilizer and other farm supplies. Diosdada is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which is to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"Honorable\"). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

Her previous loan of Php 19,500 was used to fund her vegetable-vending business, and it had a positive impact on both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions.

She can always recall the many struggles she has been through just to have something for her children to eat and survive each day. Beginning in 1999, Nancy became thankful for ASHI, Kiva field partner in the Philippines, because it was through her membership that she accessed a loan which enabled her to start a small business.\r\n\r\nShe tried several ways to earn money until the amount of loan she could request had increased. With the support of her loving husband and children, Nancy ventured into a business of selling fish and slaughtering pigs. Both are sold from her rented stall at the Municipal market. Eventually, Nancy\u2019s life has changed a bit together with her family. However, she is still financially insecure, especially the thought that her five children aged 1 to 14, are growing and their needs, especially in education, are also increasing. Nancy is scared that the present profit her business is making will not be enough for her to sustain the education of her children until they graduate from college. With that in mind, Nancy now is requesting a much larger amount of loan to expand her business. She and her husband agreed to purchase a mini-truck (multicab in Filipino) so that they can supply fish to their customers in other neighboring provinces and cities around Panay Island (small Island in the Philippines where Antique province is situated).

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

B. is 20 years old. He is a cattleman, who raises cattle to sell. At the same time, Narimon sells dried fruits in the local market. Narimon has been working as a market vendor for 3 years. Thanks to these two businesses, Narimon is able to support his parents with their household expenses. Today, Narimon is going to increase the turnover capital for his business selling dried fruits. With this purpose in mind, he is requesting $3000 US Dollars. The loan will be spent on purchasing dried fruits and cattle for selling. This is the first loan for Narimon, however, he is sure he shall be able to pay it in time and thanks everyone who trusts him with their support. \r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is 32 years old, married, and the mother of 3 children who are 13, 7, and 2 years old.  The oldest go to school.  She repeated the 6th grade after having left school to get married.  She lives in her own home with her family, and her husband is a carpenter.  She supports her parents by sending them money in order to help out with family costs.\r\n\r\nShe has never left Maputo Province; she has lived and worked in Boane District since she was young.  She has had her own business for over 7 years.  She doesn't have any assistants, but rather counts on the help of her husband, who works about 10 hours each day.  She sells capulanas (traditional colorful skirts) and sometimes even travels to Swaziland to do this.  With this work, she earns about 6,000 MZN each month, which she uses for household costs.  She even saves some through Xitique (a traditional rotating savings system).\r\n\r\nShe has never had loans with other banks.  She found out about Hluvuku through neighbors who are also clients of the institution.  This is her third loan, which has a value of 25,000 MZN.  She plans to use this loan to buy products (capulanas and len\u00e7os, or headwraps) in order to increase her supply and diversify her merchandise.  The previous loans were for 7,000 MZN and 18,000 MZN, both for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nHer objective is to diversify the products she sells in order to satisfy her customers and increase her income.  In the future, she would like to ask for more loans in order to open a hairdressing salon.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Erika Korowin, Kiva

She she and her husband separated 12 years later, she went to live in Boane.  She has had her own business for more than 15 years.  She does not have any help at her job, does not have a fixed schedule, and works by filling orders.  She sells televisions and DVD players and earns about 10,000 MZN per month, which she uses to pay for household costs.  She even saves some through Xitique (a traditional rotating savings system).\r\n\r\nShe has never had loans through other banks.  She found out about Hluvuku through Mrs. Argentina, a friend of hers who sells good at the Boane market and who is also a client of the institution.  This is her fifth loan, which has a value of 25,000 MZN.  She plans to use it to goods to resell (televisions, DVD players, etc.) in order to increase her supply and diversify her merchandise.  Her previous loans were for 7,200 MZN, 10,500 MZN, 14,000 MZN, and 20,000 MZN, all for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nIn the future she would like to ask for more loans in order to finish building her house

He is 45 years old, and the father of five children who are 21, 12, 9, 7 and 2 years old. Only four of them go to school. Jo\u00e3o only finished the fifth grade, and didn't continue because he lost his parents when he was very young. He lives with his family in his own house, and has no other dependents. \r\n\r\nHe left Inhambane for Maputo in 1978 with his family in search of better living conditions. He has lived in the town of Boane since his arrival in the province of Maputo. He has worked as a light machine operator for the Mozambique Railroads Company for over 19 years, learning his trade at the same company. He earns a monthly salary of 7150 MZN., with which he pays his household expenses as well as saving some in his bank account. \r\n\r\nHe has never held loans from other banks, and learned about Hluvuku through friends who are also clients of the organization. This is his third loan, for 16000 MZN., with which he plans to buy construction material (galvanized roofing, cement, steel doors and rebar) in order to continue building his house. The earlier loans were for 7000 MZN. and 15000 MZN., and were both for the same purpose. He would like to apply for future loans in order to complete his residence and provide more comfort for his family. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by David Kaisel, Kiva

He is 37 years old, and a single father of two children who are 12 and 3 years old. The eldest attends school. Fernando only completed the first grade, and didn't continue due to lack of resources and the negligence of his parents. He lives with his children in his own home, and also supports a brother who lives with him. \r\n\r\nHe left Maputo with his mother after she left his father, and they relocated their residence to Boane. He currently lives in this district and has owned his own shop for over 17 years. He works from 7 am until 9 pm, and mainly sells beer and soft drinks. He has no employees. \r\n\r\nHe earns around 1000 MZN a day, and uses the money for household expenses and saves some through a Xitique (a traditional savings system). He's never taken out a loan with other banks, and learned about Hluvuku through his friend Mr. Antonio Mundlovu who is also a client of the organization. This is his fourth loan, and is in the amount of 17000 MZN. He plans to use the money to purchase products (beer, wine, soft drinks and others) to increase the quality of the merchandise in his establishment. The earlier loans were for 8000 MZN, 12000 MZN and 15000 MZN, and were all used for the same purpose. \r\n\r\nIn the future, he hopes to apply for additional loans to increase the size of his commercial establishment and provide better service to his customers. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by David Kaisel, Kiva

All the members of the committee have developed independent occupations such as selling clothes, jewelry, ice cream, crafts etc.  All the members of the committee are mothers who participate with the end goal of strengthening their household economy.  They hope to develop their entrepreneurship in a sustainable way, with a vision of constant growth with the help of a permanent financial assistance.\r\n\r\nWe spoke with Mrs. Graciela Concepci\u00f3n M. C\u00e1ceres.  She is married with 2 children, a baby and a boy.  She is a teacher and works with the police.  She lives in a house in the central part of Barrio S. in the city of Villa Elisa.  Mrs. Graciela is a very active and multi-talented lady.  For the past 12 years, she has worked as a policewoman in the city of \u00d1emby and she made up the delegation that for years solicited the refurbishment of the infrastructure of the precinct.\r\n\r\nMrs. M. is the Deputy Major of the National Police.  She runs classes on the prevention of addictions.  These days she is in charge of a program to prevent addictions in the 7th precinct of \u00d1emby.  In addition, she acts as a teacher in the department of ethics and citizenship in various colleges in her community.  She also teaches a class on the prevention of addictions such as alcohol and drugs.  In 2008 and 2009, she worked to create a book aimed for the children and young people of her beloved city of \u00d1emby.\r\n\r\nHer efforts bore fruit and she published several samples with the help of local commissions and some colleges who used the material for their students.  In this way they learned of gambling, self-esteem, role models, family living, and above all to how to prevent drug use.  It is great teaching material and has been highly praised by her fellow police officers and by her fellow teachers. \r\n\r\nLast year, on the Day of the Police, she received a gold medal and a honorable mention for being the first woman police officer to publish a book.  The book titled \u201cI\u2019m Free\u201d is about the prevention of addictions.  Her goal is to print more copied of her book for other educational institutions interested in the material. \r\n\r\nGraciela is a woman who helps her community.  She is very good at unifying groups.  She forms part of various neighborhood groups such as Pro-Calle, Pro-Plaza, Pro-comisaria de \u00d1emby and has done years of work to solicit the help of the government.  Thanks to her efforts, this year they have begun the refurbishment of the new police station which is so important to this community.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Emma Felten, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1250,"image":{"id":490342,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bookstore","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy books such as a Spanish - Guarani Dictionary","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PY","country":"Paraguay","town":"Villa Elisa","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-25.366667 -57.616667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":58,"posted_date":"2010-02-18T02:40:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Graciela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ceferina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Soleda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wilma Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Agustina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hilaria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edilda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Silvia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Josefina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maxima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Virginia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucila ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isabel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Teresa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Basilia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PYG","disbursal_amount":5712342,"loan_amount":1250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":476029},{"due_date":"2010-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":476029},{"due_date":"2010-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":476029},{"due_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":476029},{"due_date":"2010-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":476029},{"due_date":"2010-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":476029},{"due_date":"2010-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":476029},{"due_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":476029},{"due_date":"2010-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":476029},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":476029},{"due_date":"2010-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":476029},{"due_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":476023}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.16},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.16},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.16},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.16},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":625,"local_amount":2856174,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:12:06Z","rounded_local_amount":2906253.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123915657,"comment":null},{"amount":416.67,"local_amount":1904116,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:03:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1937502.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128951273,"comment":null},{"amount":104.16,"local_amount":476029,"processed_date":"2010-04-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:43:31Z","rounded_local_amount":484375.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136679957,"comment":null},{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":476023,"processed_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:43:37Z","rounded_local_amount":484369.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136679958,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-02-18T06:48:14Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T10:43:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":176972,"name":"Odille","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Odille is 32 years old, is married, and takes care of two dependents.

She is 23 years old, married and the mother of a 1-year old and a 4-year old. None of the children are in school. She only went to school until the 10th grade due to a teen pregnancy. She owns the house she lives in with her family. Her husband works for Mozambique Power Company. She doesn't support anyone other than her own family.  \r\n\r\nIn 2005, she left Matola for the Boane District with her family. Her husband was transferred there by his employer. She has had her own business in her backyard for over 3 years.  She works from 7am to 5pm everyday and has no employees. Her business brings an income of around 3.000.00mt a month which goes towards house expenses and a traditional rotational savings system (Xitique). \r\n\r\nShe has never had loans from other banks. She came to know about Hluvuku through her cousin who is also a member. This loan, in the amount of 25.000.00mt, is her third. She intends to building materials (screens, beams, cement and others) to continue building her house. The previous loans were for 6.000.00mt and15.000.00mt and were used for the same purpose. \r\n\r\nShe makes a commitment to pay this loan on time, to be able to be granted further credit. In the future, she would like to request more loans to finish her house and offer more comfort to her family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Betyna

He believes that a small amount of additional capital would change that for him. For that reason, he is requesting a loan from Kiva lenders via Vision Finance Company to purchase additional products which will make him more efficient and effective and more successful. He thanks VFC and Kiva lenders for their support!\r\n\r\nSamuel is very serious in his business; the hours of his shop are from six in the morning to six in the evening every day except on Saturday and he employs one person so that his business runs well.

Her group is located in Hato Mayor, a poor, agricultural area where running water (none of which is potable) and electricity are unreliable. She makes her home here in a simple structure with her long-term partner and their child.\r\n\r\nMaria is excited to be taking her seventh loan with Esperanza after having successfully repaid her previous loans and grown her business. She plans to use this loan to invest in her business selling new clothing by purchasing jeans, polo shirts, and blouses in Santo Domingo in the main market and then selling them in her community at a profit. She will use the profits to invest in a new floor for her family, which will improve sanitary conditions. She will also save for the university education of her children. She thanks you all for your support. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1675,"image":{"id":490457,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

Mujer y Fortaleza is based in the parish of Turi, which is southeast of the city of Cuenca.  Turi is known as the city's balcony.  It is a very touristic area because of the countryside's natural beauty, the gastronomy, and the good-hearted nature of its people.  The majority of Turi's population works in agriculture.  People also work in other activities that allow them to establish themselves economically in order to move forward in life.\r\n\r\nOlga is a 25 year-old woman happily married to her husband, who is a security guard in a local store.  She has two children who are 8 and 9 years sold.  She is very happy and always looks at the positive of every day, and because of this triumphs in live.  She works as a seamstress and studied for three years in an academy to do this.  Currently she works making and selling blouses.  She has spent two years doing this from the workshop located in her house.  She tells us that the loans have helped her begin her own business.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, she expresses that she does not have her own house, so she lives in her parents' house and shares household costs with them.

He has a small grocery store, which he runs from his home in the Villa Reconciliaci\u00f3n neighborhood.  He began his business selling a warm corn drink, rice with milk, cereal, and sweets from a traveling cart.  Every day, he would sell his variety of products on the streets.  Thanks to the loans he received he was able to buy his own cart, and he is happy because it has allowed him to grow his business.\r\n\r\nWith this loan Mr. Pablo will buy basic grains, meats, chicken, soft drinks, roast, soap, and dairy products to increase his sales.  His wife helps him when he walks with his cart selling in the streets since he already has his customers and money moves more quickly.   It is tiring work, but he has to sell to cover his family's basic needs like paying for water, light, and loan payments.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lydia Brantley, Kiva

They work together to be able help each other and to be able to support their children.\r\n\r\nShe started this small business with the economic help that her mother gave her.  Then, she got a loan with Afodenic.  Sales have been growing, and she has gotten more customers.  \r\n\r\nWith this loan she will buy perfume, body and face cream, beauty products, lipstick, make-up, powder, deodorant, and hair coloring.  Her customers place orders because she works with catalogs and with Avon products.  She will also buy more ice cream, soft drinks, and pastry.  She will do this to increase sales and be able to buy another display case in the future where she can continue offering her products.  All of this has been possible with the help of the institution through their payment installments and help to small business people.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

She makes her home here in a simple structure with her long-term partner and their three children.\r\n\r\nYolanda is excited to be taking her fifth loan with Esperanza after having successfully repaid her previous loans and grown her business.

Gravito is 46 years old and lives in the Recreo neighborhood in the city of Barranquilla.  His business is the production of snacks and pastries. \r\n\r\nHe started his career as a soccer coach, but he lost his job and needed to earn some income, so he started a bakery (just selling bread) with his savings and took a course at the Sena School to learn this trade.  This business was not going well \u2013 he has some problems with liquidity \u2013 so he sought advice from the Sena School and signed up for a class on pastries.  He has been selling pastries for 5 years, and this business now allows him to earn a living; he continues to expand his diverse product line.  At first he was very nervous, because his family doubted the success of the business, but he received a lot of support anyway.  With this business, he has been able to improve his family's quality of life.  He currently has a large, independent shop and he also caters at reception halls.\r\n\r\nWhile running this business, he also offers consulting services and technical courses on pastry-making to small businesses or entrepreneurs who would like to learn these skills.  His greatest challenge is that he does not have enough working capital to expand his operations and commercialize his products within the corporate sector.  With this goal, he is seeking a loan of  $1,000,000 (Columbian) in order to buy a larger inventory of ingredients and raw materials.   His dream is to have a gourmet-style restaurant, but still faces this great challenge of insufficient working capital to expand.

She tells us that when she arrived to live at her house, it was very modest, and well, it was of rustic materials like a thatch roof. Little by little, she improved and raised it, thanks the strength of her and her husband. Now she owns a grocery store and also a small stand to pattern clothing, where she spends a lot of time working, as it's a job that requires a lot of dedication. What Mirta has to do is to receive textile fabrics, and stamps them with patterns and different border figures, making them more attractive so they can be sold more rapidly. She likes her job very much, as while as the opportunity to use her creativity. For the future, she would like to stand to become bigger and to have several employees working there, but without worrying about her grocery story, which is also very productive.

She sells fruits, vegetables, and everything that you would find at a candy shop from her home.  She conceived of her business together with her husband, who for 10 years has been selling fruits and vegetables in the public market of Barranquilla.  The two agreed on the necessity to generate a new source of income for their household, and realized that by running a business from within their home they could create this additional income.  Toward this end, Yudis, without abandoning her domestic responsibilities, especially the raising of her children, has for 4 years now been selling the same products as her husband.  She carries out her sales in the neighborhood in which she lives, knowing that there are many stores and house wives willing to buy her fruits and vegetables on account of their freshness.  \r\nCurrently, Yudis needs a loan of $ 1.000.000 to expand her supply of fruits and vegetables.  This is her second loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She applied her previous loan toward diversifying her products, adding sweets to her array of goods, which increased her sales income.  Her family's goal is to own a house of their own. With respect to her business, her goal is to improve the display of her products and her customers' ability to access her.  Her biggest obstacle is the physical infrastructure of her neighborhood; although her location is excellent, the streets in her neighborhood are not paved, creating difficulty for potential customers to access her business.  With this challenge in mind, her community has begun holding games of bingo and other such activities to raise funds to put toward improving access to their homes.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated

It will benefit her children, whom she loves very much, because they will have a better home in the town where they live, in the state of Le\u00f3n, Nicaragua .\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Catherine Fountain, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":490558,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"Purchase of construction materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":74,"posted_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa Amanda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":10000,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":780.77},{"due_date":"2010-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":804.19},{"due_date":"2010-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":828.32},{"due_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":853.17},{"due_date":"2010-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":878.76},{"due_date":"2010-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":905.13},{"due_date":"2010-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":932.28},{"due_date":"2010-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":960.25},{"due_date":"2010-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":989.06},{"due_date":"2010-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1018.73},{"due_date":"2010-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1049.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.04},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.21},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.41},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.66},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.94},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.26},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.61},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.01},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.46},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.93},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.47}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":79.25,"local_amount":1584.96,"processed_date":"2010-03-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:38:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1662.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128926452,"comment":null},{"amount":41.41,"local_amount":828.32,"processed_date":"2010-04-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:02:22Z","rounded_local_amount":868.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136653955,"comment":null},{"amount":31.84,"local_amount":636.87,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:01:21Z","rounded_local_amount":667.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144686612,"comment":null},{"amount":100.02,"local_amount":2000.19,"processed_date":"2010-07-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-12T07:42:09Z","rounded_local_amount":2097.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159609820,"comment":null},{"amount":46.61,"local_amount":932.28,"processed_date":"2010-08-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-19T08:07:21Z","rounded_local_amount":977.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166823627,"comment":null},{"amount":48.01,"local_amount":960.25,"processed_date":"2010-09-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-20T08:07:38Z","rounded_local_amount":1007.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172090716,"comment":null},{"amount":49.46,"local_amount":989.06,"processed_date":"2010-10-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:22:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1037.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177382086,"comment":null},{"amount":50.93,"local_amount":1018.73,"processed_date":"2010-11-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:34:04Z","rounded_local_amount":1068.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182519701,"comment":null},{"amount":52.47,"local_amount":1049.34,"processed_date":"2010-12-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:45:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1100.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188654102,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-03-20T00:30:40Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T12:45:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":177087,"name":"Los Jardines Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El grupo los Jardines est\u00e1 conformado por tres personas muy trabajadoras que se dedican a la comercializaci\u00f3n de frutas y verduras.

S. is 46 years old and lives with her two children, aged 19 and 6 respectively, in the Am\u00e9ricas Central neighborhood, which is located to the south-west of Bogot\u00e1, near the Metropolitano de Techo stadium, home to the La Equidad team, which is a soccer team from Bogot\u00e1.  Luz runs a general store called the Distrilac El Paisa.  This name refers to the Paisas, habitants of Antioquia, the region around Medell\u00edn.\r\n\r\nThis is Luz's first loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and she wants to use it to buy soda and other groceries like plastic cups and plates to sell in her store.  She started her business selling soda wholesale, which she distributed to small shops and grocery stores.  Her neighbors and peers, however, recommended that thanks to the location of her home, it would be a good idea to set up a general store in addition to her other business.  Luz opened her store a year ago with great success and a positive reception, thanks in part to her close location to the stadium, which has allowed her to further expand her sales.  Her store is now her largest source of revenue and she hopes this business grows even more, so she can buy the house she lives and works in.  She is also very happy right now because her son just started college on a full merit scholarship. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Julia Kastner, Kiva

On occasion the work is tough, when gasoline is expensive and customers don't want to pay that prices he quotes them, but there are good days when although he is tired he is very satisfied with his profits. His goal is to be able to make improvements to his home, such as replace the walls, paint and add a concrete bathroom since the one they currently have is lined with plastic and is a little uncomfortable while lacking privacy and hygiene, so he sees the improvements as a necessity for his family.

She lives in the district of Paij\u00e1n, province of Ascope, region of La Libertad, about three hours from the city of Chiclayo. She has run a small bodega out of her home for the past five years, offering drinks and snacks. Previously she sold vegetables at the city market, but she had to give up the activity because her children were going to work elsewhere. Since then she has used this business to solve her personal expenses and make headway.

Merciditha is the group leader of a two-member group loan offered by PMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, each is collectively responsible for paying back the loans of her fellow group member if the other party is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nMerciditha is married and has six adult-aged children. To make a living, Merciditha operates a fishing business. The main source of income for the business comes primarily from harvesting and selling ocean-caught fish in the local community. She has been engaged in her business for over 20 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Merciditha joined PMPC to gain access to financial services. She aspired to help improve her living situation and increase her ability to engage in business activities. Most recently, Merciditha has successfully repaid a previous loan in the amount of 5,000 PHP from PMPC. This loan was used to to purchase additional fish to sell.

She is 42 years old. Elena is the group leader for a three-member group loan offered by PMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n<p>\r\nElena is married and has three adult children. To make a living, Elena raises crops. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income comes from planting and harvesting corn for sale. Elena has been engaged in her business for over 36 years and earns approximately 3,600 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2007, Elena joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Elena has successfully repaid a previous loan of 14,900 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional seeds, seedlings, and young plants to raise. Elena is requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. This loan will be the sixth loan taken out by Elena from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to make improvements to her house. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n<p>\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.
