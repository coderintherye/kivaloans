rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is involved in growing agricultural crops and animal husbandry.  He spent over 25 years working as a foreman at a local collective farm.  His family helps him with processing apricots.  Abdusalom has a good income from the sales of apricots and peaches.  He leased a plot of land and wants to use it to feed livestock.  With this goal in mind, he is requesting a loan in the sum of $1000 in order to purchase

He lives in the Aknaghbyur village in the Tavush region.  Karen's wife works as a chemistry teacher at a secondary school, daughters attend a paid division of the Yerevan Pedagogy Institute, and son attends a secondary school.  Karen works in the village administration.  Concurrently with his permanent job, Karen is involved in agriculture.  He breeds cattle, grows vegetables and fruits, grapes, and grows animal feed in the field for his two cows and two calves.  Karen leaves a portion of grown agricultural products for his family and sells the rest to his neighbors and buyers from neighboring villages and towns.  Karen needs a loan in the sum of 1,000,000 dram in order to build a greenhouse, where he plans to grow tomatoes, cucumbers and other vegetables for sale, which will increase Karen's family income and allow him to pay for his daughters' education in the institute.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":668.33,"image":{"id":855891,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

Sharofatkhon started her business in 1991 by selling food products, using a starting capital in the sum of 5,000 som (KGS).  Her store, located on the main road Kadamjai-Batken (center of the area), became known for having such a wide assortment of merchandise.  Today, Sharofatkhon's store provides a stable income in the sum of 15,000 som (KGS), which allows the family to cover their expenses.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She runs a general store which she began 11 years ago when she lived in another suburb in the south of Barranquilla. Two years after she set up her business, Nancy moved to Malambo, taking advantage of the fact that her sister ran a well-known store in the area. It was actually her sister who recommended that Nancy join the Mario Santo Domingo foundation, as her growing client base wanted new products and her working capital wasn't enough to meet her customer's demands.  With the loans she obtained Nancy was able to keep her store continually stocked up with a diverse range of products for the home, which is still the case today. In spite of the challenges she has faced, Nancy has always been able to get ahead with the unconditional help of her children. Nancy accepts cash and credit payments from her customers who live locally in her area, which sees a lot of business. \r\n\r\nThis Kiva credit will be the third loan that Nancy has taken out with the Mario Santo Domingo foundation. With this loan she will buy stationery items for the home as well as clothing accessories. This investment is destined for success as it has been planned at a time when sales traditionally pick up around the Day of Love and Friendship, which is celebrated during the months of August and September.  \r\n\r\nNancy dreams of expanding her business, which is why she has her heart set on achieving sales goals in her general store.

She is the driving force behind her family. She lives with her husband and three children between the ages of 14 and 22 in the La Playa development. Her business is selling fried food such as empanadas, egg arepas, and the famous trif\u00e1sicas [club sandwiches], prepared with three kinds of meat. She also sells juice, ice cream and drinks. Her first experience with business came from having a billiards table in her old home, and selling fritangas [grilled meat and fried cow intestines, served with potatoes and arepas or with manioc and fried bananas] for additional income. Her billiards business started to decline, so they decided to direct their attention to the fried food businesses and expand them. So, with their savings, they bought the ingredients to expand their sales volume. Through their hard work they built up a strong demand for their products, and they have gradually been expanding and making a better income to reinvest in the items necessary to strengthen the business. Today they have a family business; her husband and children are also involved. Her schedule starts at 2:00 am when she starts production. She then distributes to the local and neighbouring stores and universities. She also manages a stall where 70 fixed customers make purchases every day. Her equipment includes two cases, two fryers, an industrial mill, three chairs, two tables, and kitchen utensils.\n\nThis Kiva loan is her second loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, an organization through which she has been able to include an industrial process in her business, to make her work more efficient and thus make a better income to continue improving her family's well-being. With this Kiva loan she will purchase basic materials and ingredients, such as corn, flour, oil, sugar and salt.

With her Kiva loan she will be able to purchase at discounted rates, in cash, and in a greater volume.

It is a mark of her family's tradition of quality customer service and hotel management that she is able to use her knowledge and her calling to service to help her business to grow. Because of her independent experiences as a merchant, she has been able to expand her merchandise, guided and driven by her mother, who is also a merchant and participates in the Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo. Mary's capital is not sufficient to cover the demand of the market, especially in this season of celebration of love and friendship; she has many orders. This is why she has turned to this Kiva loan.

Su mayor desaf\u00edo fue terminar sus estudios, pero ha contado con el apoyo de su madre y de sus familiares para lograr sacar adelante todo cuanto se propone.

She takes advantage of her knowledge of beautician services and body mechanics, which she learned during her studies to be a cosmetologist, and puts them to good use for the benefit of the community by providing facials and body treatments.  This also allows her to earn her own income.\r\n\r\nHer goal is to move to a less domestic market than where she is currently, and to take on contracts with businesses.  She has therefore made proposals to business directors that she provide a service for preventing occupational risks by means of her treatments.  For this, she needs a massage chair to provide the relaxing massages that her plan requires.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to have her own aesthetic and beauty salon in her own home, and with this to be able to support the well-being of her family.  Her big challenge was finishing her education, but she had the support of her mother and relatives to be able to succeed at everything she put herself to.  Currently, there are many of her dreams that she wants to achieve.  Foremost of these is achieving socio-economic stability with her business, so as to \r\nmeet the challenges that she must take on in the future.\r\n\r\nThis is her first financing through the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, with which which she will buy a massage chair and supplies.

Sofanor sells soft drinks and fried foods, a business he started after working for an important soft-drink company.  He used his experience as a driver and, later, soft-drink vendor to finally, after some health problems, decide to make use of his wife's cooking expertise to begin his business venture, which began to generate income to support his family.  Today they make turnovers, corn cakes, and fried plantains in their stall, and sell soft drinks, which he distributes in their neighborhood and in neighboring areas.\r\n\r\nHis stall is located in a park facing his house, a place with high traffic from pedestrians, public transportation, and private cars.  In the stall he has a  warming case, a grinder, a simple stove and an industrial stove, and two electric mills and one manual mill.  All this infrastructure is insufficient to respond to the required production levels of his growing clientele.  This is why he is requesting a Kiva loan, the first loan he has solicited from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  With the loan he will buy an industrial stove and raw materials to take advantage of discounts for cash and bulk sales.\r\n\r\nSofanor's longterm goal is to diversify his offerings, including a line of sausages he is studying to find out its potential.

She has a daughter, who is 2 years old. There, since 2007, she has sold a variety of merchandise such as perfumes, clothing, and cosmetics through orders placed from catalogs or at exhibits. She sells on credit, with agreements with her customers for payments in two weeks. Her customers include employees, police staff, relatives, neighbors, friends, and people referred to her, who increase every day. When she ventured to begin this business which would generate income for her, she was supported by a relative who lent her money. This was how she started up an important business to sell her products through catalogs, as she has done up to this date,  but now she also buys in the commercial zone of Barranquilla from other merchants whose catalog she doesn't have. With her business, she has succeeded in attracting a growing customer base and in buying a display case to exhibit her merchandise in the house of her mother, with whom she lives, along with her brother and her little daughter, whom she dreams of raising to be a successful professional and is the main motivation for her life. Her dream and great challenge is to have a well-located store specializing in cosmetic lines and clothing. With her Kiva loan, her first financing through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, she will have additional capital to buy clothing and cosmetics for which she has orders, and she wants to do this in a timely manner so that she does not lose customers. Her investment will be successful since she still has orders from her most profitable clients and she will be prepared with her Kiva loan for the seasons in which sales rise, such as the month of love and friendship.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":318.3,"image":{"id":856295,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy clothing and cosmetics for which she has orders that she wants to fill in a timely manner","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad Atl\u00e0ntico","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-09-03T19:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mayra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1200000,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":89892},{"due_date":"2011-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":91615},{"due_date":"2011-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":93371},{"due_date":"2011-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":95160},{"due_date":"2012-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":96984},{"due_date":"2012-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":98843},{"due_date":"2012-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":100738},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":102669},{"due_date":"2012-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":104636},{"due_date":"2012-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":106642},{"due_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":108686},{"due_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":110764}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.56},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.54},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.52},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.53},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.55},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.6},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.66},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.76},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.85},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.99},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.14},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":50.56,"local_amount":89892,"processed_date":"2011-09-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:05:18Z","rounded_local_amount":89903.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232803759,"comment":null},{"amount":51.54,"local_amount":91615,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:18:15Z","rounded_local_amount":91626.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238614830,"comment":null},{"amount":52.52,"local_amount":93371,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-26T08:50:07Z","rounded_local_amount":93382.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244568784,"comment":null},{"amount":53.53,"local_amount":95160,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:06:40Z","rounded_local_amount":95171.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250780109,"comment":null},{"amount":54.55,"local_amount":96984,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:20:31Z","rounded_local_amount":96996.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257188503,"comment":null},{"amount":55.6,"local_amount":98843,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:36:18Z","rounded_local_amount":98855.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263324720,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-09-04T17:06:39Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":330295,"name":"Miriam Amanda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Miriam  D. 32 a\u00f1os D. edad vive   al sur D. la ciudad con su c\u00f3nyuge y sus 4 hijos, que estudian y se encuentran  en las edades D. 4 a 12 a\u00f1os.

She has a restaurant in her home, where she sells home-cooked lunches.\r\n\r\nHer experience in this goes back 10 years, to when she worked in a small restaurant very close to her home, where she prepared meals, and also ran the place. The owner of this business couldn't continue with it, and proposed to Miriam that she buy it. From the time she decided, she has managed to increase her income.  \r\n\r\nThe support of her older daughter and of her husband have been key for the success of her restaurant.

Her business dates back to when her brother was selling merchandise that came from the town of Maicao in the department of La Guajira.  With this experience, Merys began her business venture four years ago with a small amount of merchandise, distributing it on credit to her initial market of family, neighbors, and friends.  Gradually her growing clientele began to recognize her and ask her for clothing, small electric appliances, and so on, and from there she expanded her range a little.  At present Merys sells on credit in terms agreed upon individually with her customers; she recovers her money weekly, twice a month, and monthly, in accordance with each agreement.\n\nHer Kiva loan is her first funding from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.

Because of this she was unable to go to school because her disability kept her from understanding what the teachers were saying.\r\n\r\nShe has a business selling groceries.  She started out selling candy at first at home.  She says that she\u2019d keep it in her closet and sell it to her little nieces and nephews and one of them would help her sell and collect payments.

Her business grew, but her customers did not provide her with the fabrics and supplies that she needed to make a particular dress, so she began producing at all costs and also started exhibiting dresses of different sizes.  Martha gradually acquired more merchandise such as cosmetics, lipsticks, perfumes, and other items so that she could increase her sales.  At the moment, she is taking advantage of the time of year when her sales rebound by stocking her business with products that she knows her customers will need.  \r\n<p>\r\nFor this reason Martha is requesting a Kiva loan, her first form of financing through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She will use the money to buy raw materials for making dresses, as well as perfumes, cosmetics, shoes, and other items in time for the Day of Love and Friendship (the Colombian equivalent to Valentine\u2019s Day).

Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral.  This is Tasileta's first loan with SPBD.

Su credikiva es el primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, organizaci\u00f3n con la cual planea su crecimiento desde sus indicadores financieros actuales, que son apropiados al tipo de actividades que desempe\u00f1a y desde los cuales se estudi\u00f3 su potencial crecimiento. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","en":"Teresa lives in the Nelson Mandela neighborhood of Cartagena where she works selling men's sandals, women's shoes, sandals, and where she recently began selling clothes and undergarments.  For extra income, she sells cakes and rolls for cash on the weekends.  Her partner supports her in all of her business activities.  \r\n\r\nHer immediate goal is to get more work capital in order to buy shoes that she has on order for her customers.  This is the reason she is applying for a Kiva loan, as her work capital is no longer sufficient to meet her business's demand because of the the holidays coming up in September.  During these holidays, such as Columbian Valentine's Day, there is a significant upturn in sales and Teresa needs to take advantage of it to invest and earn money.  \r\n\r\nThis Kiva loan is the first financing she is seeking with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She plans to grow with this organization from her current financial indicators, which are in line with the kind of business she does and from which she has studied her potential for growth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":268.72,"image":{"id":856420,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy a higher volume of shoes that she has on order for her customers ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Cartagena de Indias","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-09-04T04:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":71076},{"due_date":"2011-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":76272},{"due_date":"2011-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":77734},{"due_date":"2011-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":79223},{"due_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":80742},{"due_date":"2012-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":82289},{"due_date":"2012-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":83867},{"due_date":"2012-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":85474},{"due_date":"2012-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":87112},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":88782},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":90484},{"due_date":"2012-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":96945}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.87},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.86},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.69},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.56},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.42},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.32},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.22},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.15},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.09},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.05},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.03},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.74}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40.87,"local_amount":71076,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:05:50Z","rounded_local_amount":72664.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232803777,"comment":null},{"amount":43.86,"local_amount":76272,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:18:12Z","rounded_local_amount":77976.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238614849,"comment":null},{"amount":44.69,"local_amount":77734,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:59:37Z","rounded_local_amount":79471.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244568801,"comment":null},{"amount":45.56,"local_amount":79223,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:07:16Z","rounded_local_amount":80993.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250780124,"comment":null},{"amount":46.42,"local_amount":80742,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:21:20Z","rounded_local_amount":82546.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257188518,"comment":null},{"amount":47.32,"local_amount":82289,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:34:55Z","rounded_local_amount":84128.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263324734,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-09-27T15:21:50Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":330367,"name":"Noataga","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Noataga is 31 years of age and married with five children.

She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 350 talas or US $146 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Vaitapu joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral.  This is Vaitapu's 2nd loan with SPBD.

Sra. Leslie was recently named group president and she hopes to ensure that all of the members prosper.  She operates a business making and selling tamales.  She joined a church project where she learned the business and now she works independently.  Her husband and children support her efforts.  She prepares the tamales at home once a week, making 200 of them and delivering them on Saturdays and Sundays.  Some of her buyers have become regular customers.  The business provides her with an extra income that, in turn, allows her to pay for some on-going work on her house.  She is also saving for a \"semi-industrial\" kitchen that will allow her to make more tamales and she wants to print flyers so that she can advertise her business to potential customers.  The loan will be a big help because she will be able to buy new pans and other kitchen utensils that she needs to work.\r\n\r\nSra.

This area is known for its rich cuisine and its vegetation.  The majority of this area's people work in agriculture and commerce in general.\r\n\r\nIn this location, we meet Se\u00f1ora Clara.  She is 53 years old and is married. She has two children from her marriage who are already grown; one of them still lives with her.  Her husband is retired as he is disabled.\r\n\r\nIn addition to caring for her husband, she has in her home a small store where she sells foodstuffs and fast food such as empanadas, corviches (a dish made from green plantains and fish), sodas, juices, and also candy.  She takes advantage of the fact that there is a school near her home, and that a large majority of the students come to buy her products.

Due to inadequate capital, she is asking for a loan of P15,000 to buy ingredients (vegetables, pork and fish) to be cooked and sold in her food stall. \r\n\r\nShe mentioned that she needs to work hard and strive harder to achieve her goals.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
