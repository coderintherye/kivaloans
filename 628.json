His wife and children help him tend to the store.\r\n\r\nHe needs the loan to buy barbering supplies and tools, tools to work in refrigeration and to buy soft drinks and juice for the grocery store.  With this investment he will be able to do the refrigeration jobs more quickly, have work tools that will allow him to work in the barber shop more efficiently and the stock in his grocery store will improve income.  His next goals are to improve the barber shop\u2019s locale, to have a better established grocery store and to buy a motorcycle for work.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":807570,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy barber

Today she only has a small glass case where she displays products in addition to those that she sells on the street.  She needs a loan to buy merchandise including clothing, shoes and silver jewelry to sell.

He started his business raising and butchering pigs then, after a while, he changed direction and started selling groceries from a small grocery store that he set up in his home.  As this business was not profitable, he now buys and sells cattle and grows coffee.  With the help of some young men, Nicolas is able to work in his businesses from 6.00am to 1.00pm. \r\n\r\nNicolas will use the loan that he has requested to buy manure and urea (fertilizer).

She is the group leader of a seven-member group loan offered by SEDA. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is \u0110\u00f4ng Th\u00e1i 1 - nh\u00f3m 11 (11).\r\n\r\nHu\u1ec7 is married and has two adult-aged children. To making a living, Hu\u1ec7 owns and operates a business making food items such as beef noodle soup and bun cha, and selling food. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling snacks and other delicacies in the local community.  Hu\u1ec7 has been engaged in this business for over two years and earns approximately 3.000.000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Hu\u1ec7 joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Hu\u1ec7 has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5.152.000 VND from SEDA. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. She is now requesting a new loan of 7.392.000 VND, which will be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make food items for sale. The loan will be the second loan taken out by the borrower from SEDA. Hu\u1ec7 plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to save as a reserve for future emergencies.\r\n\r\nAbout the Other Borrowers in the Group:\r\n\r\n1.  Thanh is a 46 year-old female who is requesting a 7.392.000 VND loan to support her business in the agriculture sector of raising livestock and feeding pigs.\r\n\r\n2.

When he has some time fR. that job, he always assists Suong on the farm. \r\n\r\nThey are blessed with two children who still study in the local school, and they depend on their income for a few needs such as food, clothing and education.

She lives in a traditional household with her husband and children in the 1st quarter of S\u00e9gou (fourth administrative region in the Republic of Mali).\r\nNot having attended school for societal reasons, she began working in business at an early age with her mother, who sold condiments and cereals. After several years of training at her mother's side, she eventually started her own business selling fruit and fruit juice. She has run this business for 20 years and has extensive experience and a large clientele. Her strong sales are due to the quality of her fruit and also to the taste of the juice she sells.\r\nTo make her juice, she uses 5kg of sugar, 10 packets of powdered juice, and 2 kg of powdered ginger, all mixed with 8 litres of water. She then pours the juice into plastic bottles and packets, which will be stored in a freezer before being sold.\r\nWith the goal of meeting her customers' demands, she turned to Soro Yiriwaso and has been working with this institution for 60 months. After 4 solidarity (group) loans and 3 individual loans, all repaid properly, she is on her fourth individual loan, which she intends to use to buy a freezer. She gets her supplies locally. Soumba sells her goods in cash and on credit to a clientele composed of women and men. She foresees realizing a monthly profit of 120,000 FCFA, which will allow her to repay her loan and participate in traditional social events.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

There are few other businesses selling similar items in the market where Shahlokhon has her kiosk. Because of this, customer demand continues to grow all the time. Shahlokhon has established a reputation as an entrepreneur with integrity. \r\n\r\nShahlokhon is requesting a loan for 5000 TJS to re-stock her inventory before the fall season. Compelling prices, along with a wide range of fashion and fabric choices to suit every taste and lifestyle, will attract many new female clients to her business. An increase in sales will help her generate more profit and expand her trade even more.  \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She lives in Bamenda North west region of Cameroon.\nHer major challenges in life have been the difficulty of her children dropping out of school and inadequate capital to start up a business for herself  before joining GHAPE. She has also suffered greatly from ill health. Given a loan she plans to buy pig feed, drugs for the animals, maintain her piggery and transport her newly bought piglets to their nursing site. Christina knows her business is going to succeed because she had acquired some basic training in finance management and pig training from GHAPE and also has ten years of experience in this business. She also  has got the land and other support. The loan if granted will enable her to sell in her neighborhood at cheaper rates. Christina has successfully borrowed and repaid loansin the past\nShe will plough back her profit into her business and use part to care for her family. She also will use the proceeds to finish the construction plan she earlier started. Her childrens school needs will be taken care of. She prefers GHAPE because of the training she frequently receives and the low cost in obtaining and paying back a loan.\n\nAbout GHAPE \nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instils a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\n\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":261.91,"image":{"id":808579,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy feed, maintain the  pigsty, transportation and purchase  piglets","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Bafut, NW.

She lives in Church Center Bamenda, Northwest region in Cameroon. She is separated with 3 children. With the difficulties she had in the matrimonial home she was unable to cope with the situation. Her parents died when she was still young. Shetu Ndjrumbomenyi was unable to continue her education. Her last resort was to get married, which could provide a solution to her problem, but later turned out to be a negative. Since she separated from her husband, the husband has never supported her nor provided needs for the children so she is the sole person that provides for the basic needs for herself and the children. \r\n\r\nBefore joining GHAPE, she was roasting fish, but without capital. She usually borrows and sells before paying, which earns her little income. Given a new loan, Shetu Ndjrumbomenyi plans to continue her business and even expand. She has a good site with more customers who are ready to buy. The profit she will obtain from the loan will enable her to pay her children's school fees and also provide the family with basic needs. \r\n\r\nShetu Ndjrumbomenyi prefers a loan from GHAPE because of the interest rate and repayment modalities offered. It is better when compared to other financial houses found in her locality. This, along with the training GHAPE gives its clients before a loan is granted, has also encouraged her to join GHAPE.\r\n\r\nAbout GHAPE\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instils a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.

Con el prestamo solicitado comprar\u00e1 abarroteria en general (arroz, cafe, azucar, frijoles, manteca, pastas, condimentos, etc) y su pulperia estar\u00e1 surtida de mas y variados productos. Una dificultad con su negocio es que algunos de sus clientes le piden fiado y se tardan bastante tiempo en pagarle y eso hace que en ocasiones no tenga dinero para invertirlo en la pulperia. Su meta es sacar a sus hijos adelante en sus estudios y tener un negocio mas grande. Desde que FAMA la apoya con prestamos siente que ha podido realizar muchas cosas para ella y su familia. Tienes varios ciclos en FAMA y ha sido una cliente puntual en sus pagos.  \n","en":"Sandra Lizeth is 32 years old and lives in Telica Abajo community, 40 minutes from the city of Juticalpa.  She is a single mother and has three children. Sandra has a small grocery store in her home which she works in on her own from Monday to Sunday, from 6.00am to 9.00pm.  Sandra started this business because she frequently had to travel to Juticalpa to buy food for her household in a grocery store there.  As she kept a good stock of products in her house, her neighbors always came round to borrow stuff.  After a while they would return what they had borrowed.  It occurred to Sandra that instead of lending products, she could sell them instead.\r\n\r\nSandra will use the loan that she has requested to buy general groceries (rice, coffee, sugar, beans, butter, pasta, herbs and spices etc.), so that her grocery store will be better stocked with a wider range or products.  One difficulty she has with her business is that some of her customers ask to buy on account and then take quite a long time to pay.  This means that sometimes she doesn't have the money she needs to invest in her store.\r\n\r\nSandra's goals are to get her children ahead in their studies and to have a bigger business.  Since FAMA have been supporting her with loans, she feels that she has been able to do many things for herself and her family.  She has been working with FAMA for several loan cycles and has been punctual in making her loan repayments."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":820150,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"to buy groceries","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Juticalpa, Olancho","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":168,"posted_date":"2011-07-22T18:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sandra Lizeth ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":4000,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2011-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":225,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:43:51Z","rounded_local_amount":4251.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221657984,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-07-22T18:12:42Z","paid_date":"2011-08-15T08:43:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":314997,"name":"Santa Rosa De Yanacoto Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Benito es socio hace m\u00e1s D. 3 a\u00f1os  D.

Throughout his life Serapio has worked in many trades. Currently he is a construction worker and he is frequently sought out by his neighbors. Whenever there is a roof to be installed or a wall that needs to be built he is in charge of the work. What he most enjoys is the way he is able to enjoy his work in construction. He knows that with this decent work he is able to pay for his children's education. He has been in business for 10 years. The most difficult part is having to transport the heavy bricks and to mix cement with his bare hands. It has caused his hands to age very quickly. He wishes to upgrade his tools, to improve the work that he carries out. He is very responsible and he doesn't want to be in difficulties with his association for lack of money. So he is constantly making new contactsto secure more construction jobs. He is a member of the communal bank \"Mujeres al Futuro\", meaning \"Women to the Future\" and it is his fourth loan with MFP (Kiva Field Partner).

But over time, she realized that she was neglecting her husband and children and so she decided to change her business and set up a grocery store in her house.

a\u00f1os; all\u00ed se dedica a la venta de productos naturales y productos de limpieza para el hogar. Como esencias, fragancias, productos veterinarios, \u00e1cidos, venenos y desinfectantes.  Daveiva  empez\u00f3 su negocio en el a\u00f1os 1995,  por iniciativa e su esposo ya fallecido, quien decidi\u00f3 proporcionarle un medio de sustento a su familia antes de morir, de manera que pudieran defenderse y eso fue su legado antes de morir en el a\u00f1o 2007. Su negocio ha sido posible, gracias a  los esfuerzos realizados conjuntamente con  su cu\u00f1ada y su hijo mayor y se siente muy satisfecha porque su disciplina y trabajo han permitido responder a las necesidades b\u00e1sicas de su familia.  Su meta m\u00e1s adelante es ampliarlo y tener mas puntos comerciales, pero su capital de trabajo aun no es suficiente para este prop\u00f3sito. Este es justamente el motivo por el cual ha recurrido a su credikiva, que es el primer financiamiento con la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, con el comprar\u00e1 esencias, desinfectantes, productos veterinarios en mayor volumen, con tal de ganar descuentos por la compra de contado y en una cuant\u00eda que entusiasme a sus proveedores para hacerle una oferta tentadora.  \nSu mayor desaf\u00edo y sue\u00f1o, es lograr que sus hijos tengan una educaci\u00f3n de calidad para que en un futuro, logren ser exitosos en todo lo que emprendan.  Mientras Daveiva trabaja por cumplir sus sue\u00f1os, se esmera d\u00eda a dio por lograr fortalecer su negocio, en el cual ocurre un repunte en las ventas en cada quincena y una disminuci\u00f3n de ellas en \u00e9pocas de lluvia, lo cual se convierte tambi\u00e9n  en su gran desaf\u00edo.\n","en":"Daveiva, 46, is a hardworking woman who lives in Soledad with her three children who are from 11-19 years of age.  She sells natural products and cleaning items for the home such as perfumes, essence,  veterinary products, acids, poisons and disinfectants.  Daveiva began her business on her own in 1995 prompted by her husband so that she would be able to support her family if he died , and this business was his legacy when he passed away in 2007.  Her business has been possible thanks to the efforts she has made along with her sister-in-law and her oldest son, and she feels very happy because her discipline and work have allowed her to cover her family\u2019s basic expenses.  \r\n\r\nHer goal for the future is to expand her business and to have more sales options, but her working capital isn\u2019t enough for this end.  So this is exactly the motivation she has to request a Kiva loan, her first financing with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation.  She will use the money to buy  essences, disinfectants  and a large number of veterinary products so that she can receive volume discounts and purchase with cash in a quantity that will appeal to her suppliers to make her attractive offers.\r\n\r\nHer greatest dream and challenge is for her children to have a quality education so that their futures will be successful in all they try to achieve.  While Daveiva works to fulfill these dreams, she strives every day to strengthen her business: her sales rise every payday and fall in the rainy season, which has also become a big challenge.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":340.93,"image":{"id":808825,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy essences, disinfectants, and veterinary products in large volume","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad-Atlantico","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-07-14T17:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Daveiva Amparo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1070000,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":70583},{"due_date":"2011-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":81507},{"due_date":"2011-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":83069},{"due_date":"2011-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":84661},{"due_date":"2011-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":86284},{"due_date":"2012-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":87937},{"due_date":"2012-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":89623},{"due_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":91341},{"due_date":"2012-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":93091},{"due_date":"2012-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":94876},{"due_date":"2012-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":96694},{"due_date":"2012-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":110334}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.23},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.61},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.52},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.45},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.4},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.37},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.35},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.35},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.37},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.42},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.48},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":41.23,"local_amount":70583,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:01:34Z","rounded_local_amount":72768.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227320475,"comment":null},{"amount":47.61,"local_amount":81507,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:05:42Z","rounded_local_amount":84030.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232803591,"comment":null},{"amount":48.52,"local_amount":83069,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:17:31Z","rounded_local_amount":85640.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238614674,"comment":null},{"amount":99.85,"local_amount":170945,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:59:01Z","rounded_local_amount":176237.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244568626,"comment":null},{"amount":51.37,"local_amount":87937,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:21:19Z","rounded_local_amount":90659.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257188358,"comment":null},{"amount":52.35,"local_amount":89623,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:36:09Z","rounded_local_amount":92397.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263324585,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-07-28T16:41:31Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":315015,"name":"Yvonne's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Yvonne\u2018s group is comprised of four hardworking women.

She has five children ranging in ages from 5 to 27 years.  For the last 18 years, since she received the house she currently lives in from the national government because she was the victim of erosion, she decided to sell coffee and sugar taking advantage of the fact that her mother was known for working in the market.  A grainer financed her initial purchases.  When Aid\u00e9e\u2019s mother disappeared her banana selling business passed down to her and this is where she gained most of her experience.\r\n\r\nLater on, noticing business opportunities in the neighborhood where she still lives and striving to be able to pay closer attention to her family obligations, she decided to set up a food selling business because it was difficult for her neighbors because there was no gas and they had to work so it occurred to her to offer prepared meals cooked over firewood.  Her clientele dates from back then and she has gradually gained position in the market until this day when she has better infrastructure and a good clientele composed of housewives, employees, independent workers who consume the fried fast food and lunches she prepares daily; most pay cash though she does have a few credit customers.\r\n\r\nHer goal for later on is to do more adjustments to her locale installing a comfortable terrace that\u2019s protected from the sun and the rain so that her customers can find a place of rest and pleasant refuge in her place of business.\r\n\r\nHer Kiva loan is her first.  She will buy ingredients in larger amounts to prepare her meals because her greatest challenge is not having sufficient working capital to pay cash and in significant volume that will allow her to keep good stock inventory on hand and to diminish transportation costs.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":202.45,"image":{"id":808830,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":" to buy meal preparation ingredients in larger amounts.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad Atl\u00e0ntico","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-07-12T23:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aidee ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":43602},{"due_date":"2011-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":46673},{"due_date":"2011-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":47568},{"due_date":"2011-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":48480},{"due_date":"2011-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":49409},{"due_date":"2012-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":50356},{"due_date":"2012-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":51321},{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":52305},{"due_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":53307},{"due_date":"2012-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":56979}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.16},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.01},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.54},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.08},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.65},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.21},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.8},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.38},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.98},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.19}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":26.16,"local_amount":43602,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:01:50Z","rounded_local_amount":46174.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227320476,"comment":null},{"amount":28.01,"local_amount":46673,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:06:01Z","rounded_local_amount":49426.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232803592,"comment":null},{"amount":28.54,"local_amount":47568,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:17:48Z","rounded_local_amount":50374.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238614675,"comment":null},{"amount":29.08,"local_amount":48480,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:59:17Z","rounded_local_amount":51340.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244568627,"comment":null},{"amount":29.65,"local_amount":49409,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:07:51Z","rounded_local_amount":52324.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250779966,"comment":null},{"amount":30.21,"local_amount":50356,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:21:39Z","rounded_local_amount":53327,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257188359,"comment":null},{"amount":30.8,"local_amount":51321,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:34:39Z","rounded_local_amount":54348.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263324586,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-07-14T17:21:11Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":315017,"name":"Mariana De Jesus","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mariana de 35 a\u00f1os, vive en una zona peri-urbana en el Fort\u00edn de Guayaquil.

During the second half of the year, many heads of household receive pay raises and bonuses.  Jader wants to cater to the tastes and interests of his customers.  Otherwise, it would not be possible for him to generate additional income by the end of the year.   \r\n<p>\r\nJader started his business in 2003 and finished his law degree in 2010.  Now he practices his profession as a lawyer and his mother helps him with managing the business.  She is a hardworking woman who receives a retirement pension and operates the business with a friendly and helpful attitude.  His main customers are pedestrians off the street, referrals from his existing customers, and relatives.  Even though the level of competition is strong, Jader is able to maintain the loyalty and appreciation of his customers because they know they are in good hands, those of his mother.  Jader\u2019s business is open from 9am to 9pm, Monday through Sunday.  Through his efforts and with the help of Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, he has built up sufficient credentials to be recognized as a qualified lawyer.

Angela is very content because she is able to help her husband with the school expenses of their youngest son, who still lives with them.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":804249,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to purcahse a new grill and kitchen implements.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2011-07-13T12:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Angela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":183.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":183.34},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":183.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":183.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":183.34},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":183.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":183.33,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2011-07-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:09:45Z","rounded_local_amount":503.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221712532,"comment":null},{"amount":183.34,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2011-08-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T09:50:36Z","rounded_local_amount":503.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227082932,"comment":null},{"amount":183.33,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2011-09-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:41:36Z","rounded_local_amount":503.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232844559,"comment":null},{"amount":183.33,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2011-10-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:48:42Z","rounded_local_amount":503.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238659432,"comment":null},{"amount":183.34,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:36:53Z","rounded_local_amount":503.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244613520,"comment":null},{"amount":183.33,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2011-12-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:44:13Z","rounded_local_amount":503.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250828731,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-07-18T20:57:37Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T10:44:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":315057,"name":"Claudia De La Concepci\u00f3n","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Claudia, de 47 a\u00f1os de edad, originaria de la ciudad de Masaya, actualemente vive en Palacaguina - Estel\u00ed,, donde se cas\u00f3 y tuvo tres hijos, de profesi\u00f3n Maestra, tiene un peque\u00f1o bar desde hace trece a\u00f1os el cual lo inicio con capital propio, generandole \u00e9ste mas ingresos a su hogar.

His work day begins very early in the morning and goes until 1:00 pm. His biggest advantage is that the soil where he grows his coffee is very fertile, although at times a harmful fungus appears. He fights it by applying lime and this incurs extra costs and at time she doesn't have the money to do it. This is his first loan and he needs it since it is time to re-plant and he will do it with 6,000 plants. He also has to pay for the clearing of 400 meters of land and buy fertilizer. Wilmer hopes that with the support of this loan, he will have what he needs to improve the condition of his crop and therefore his earnings will increase and he will be able to support his family and send his children to school so they will be educated and have a profession some day. His goal is to increase the quantity of plants in order to become a large scale coffee farmer.

She is noted as being a very cheerful and sincere woman.  She lives in her own home together with her husband Rolando and her youngest son, 22 year-old Gerardo, who she loves very much.\r\n\r\nNora's business is weaving handicrafts.  She has a sales stall in the craft center in San Pedro de Cajas.  This is where she sells the items that she makes and they are bought very quickly by her customers since the designs that she makes are very original.  She also stocks her business with a variety of loom-produced crafts and tapestries from other craftspeople in her area.\r\n\r\nWhat Nora most enjoys about her work is weaving and developing her creativity.  She has been in this business for seven years and she considers the most difficult part of her work to be having to spend the whole day on her sales stall without being able to go out.  However, this does not discourage her since she knows that she has to sell her products as quickly as she can so that she can take some time out every 20 days as her husband arrives home from the mine where he works and they are able to share most of their time together.\r\n\r\nNora also farms.
