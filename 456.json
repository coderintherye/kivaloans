He is married and has two grown-up children. To make a living, I Made Wirya raises cattle for sale. I Made Wirya has been in this business for over eight years and earns approximately 875,000 Indonesian rupiah (IDR) a month. His favorite part of the job is feeding the cows because it makes him feel at peace. I Made Wirya also owns a chili garden in North Bali. \r\n\r\nIn 2010, I Made Wirya joined MUK to gain access to financial services to help improve his living conditions and enable him to engage in business activities. I Made Wirya is requesting his first loan from MUK. He is requesting a loan of 10,000,000 IDR which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. I Made Wirya plans to use additional revenue to improve and expand his business.\r\n\r\n<b>About MUK<\/b>\r\nThe mission of Koperasi Mitra Usaha Kecil (MUK) is to assist small businesses in Bali by providing training, business consultation and loans, thereby helping the owners and their families improve their everyday lives.\r\n\r\nI Made Wirya 0 (0) merupakan 53 tahun pria.  Dia (laki-laki) tinggal di kota Melaya - Bali.  Dia (laki-laki) menikah dan memiliki 2 anak usia dewasa.  Untuk membiayai hidup, I Made Wirya memiliki & menjalankan usaha.  Bisnis beroperasi di sektor pertanian.  Tujuan utama bisnis tersebut adalah memelihara ternak.  Meskipun bukan satu-satunya sarana untuk menghasilkan pendapatan, sumber utama penghasilan bisnis tersebut terutama berasal dari beternak sapi untuk dijual.  I Made Wirya sudah menjalankan bisnis ini selama lebih dari 8 tahun.  Dari kegiatan-kegiatan ini, I Made Wirya menghasilkan sekitar 875,000 IDR sebulan.\r\n\r\nDalam 2010, I Made Wirya bergabung MUK untuk mendapatkan akses ke layanan keuangan untuk membantu meningkatkan  -nya kondisi kehidupan dan kemampuan untuk menjalankan kegiatan bisnis.  I Made Wirya telah berhasil melunasi pinjaman sebelumnya dari MUK.    Dia (laki-laki) sekarang meminta pinjaman baru sebesar 10,000,000 IDR.  Pinjaman saat ini akan digunakan untuk untuk membeli pakan ternak & pasokan lain.  Pinjaman ini akan menjadi 1st pinjaman yang diambil oleh peminjam dari MUK.  I Made Wirya berencana untuk menggunakan pendapatan tambahan yang dihasilkan dari bisnis  untuk meningkatkan\/memperluas bisnis peminjam.\r\n\r\nTentang MUK:\r\nMisi Koperasi Mitra Usaha Kecil (MUK) adalah untuk membantu usaha kecil di Bali dengan memberikan perlatihan, konsultasi bisnis, dan pinjaman uang, dengan demikian membantu pemilik usaha dan keluarga mereka memperbaiki hidup sehari-hari.\r\n\r\nPesan untuk Peminjam Kiva: Grup ini memakai model pinjaman komunitas\/\"\"community lending\"\" (biasanya dijuluk Bank Desa\/\"\"Village Banking\"\") yang populer di Asia. Di model ini, sejumlah representatif dari grup akan meminjam uang sejumlah lebih besar untuk seluruh grup (kadang-kadang seluruh desa). Representatif ini akan distribusi dan mengendalikan pinjaman, dan mengkoleksi pembayaran untuk peminjam akhir. Ini adalah praktek umum dan efisien di daerah ini, tapi merumitkan cara lapor untuk Kiva. Tidak serupa pinjaman lain, partner Kiva, MUK, akan menjadi kontak utama dengan tim kepemimpinan grup, yang sebaliknya menjadi kontak dengan peminjam akhir. Demikian, jurnal yang ditulis akan merefleksikan hasilnya tim kepemimpinan, bukannya peminjam-peminjam akhir.\r\n\r\n\r\nUntuk belajari lebih banyak tentang Village Banking di Wikipedia, mohon

They wish to have a stable business, to build their own house, to send their only child to a better school and to live comfortably and happily. It was 2008 when she joined Ahon sa Hirap, Inc. (ASHI), partner Microfinance Institution of KIVA in the Philippines. She joins ASHI and KIVA because she believes that these institutions can help her achieve her dreams. When she received her loan she used it properly on farming and now she earns a profit. She also maintains very good performance and shows discipline as a member. She is rewarded for her effort. Now, she is applying again for a new loan to use towards their rice field production. This loan will be used to purchase sacks of organic fertilizers, pesticides and to pay for the farm labor. The income from this business will help the couple in their daily needs and in preparation for the future of their children. The couple's plan is to expand their business and to seek an additional income generating project venture in the near future. They are hoping that ASHI and KIVA will always support their plan and their financial needs to be freed from the cycle of poverty.

Lorna has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 9000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Lorna joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Lorna has successfully repaid a previous loan of 15000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Lorna is requesting a new loan of 18000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. This will be the 6th loan taken out by Lorna from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

N. is 20 years old and lives in the town of Bulenga in the Kampala West region of Uganda. She is single and has two children. One of her children is currently in school. Justine has a business running a hotel\/restaurant, which she has had for 5 years.\r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Justine has requested a loan of 200,000 Ugandan shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase a fridge for drinks for her hotel\/restaurant. With the help of this loan from BRAC, Justine hopes to generate greater profits and pay for her child's school fees. In the future, Justine hopes to own a house. Justine is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program which has improved her prospects for the future by teaching her how to maintain her business.\r\n\r\n<b>Note to lenders:<\/b> \r\nBRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product to Kiva which funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills. Afterward, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses. These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance. Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans and giving Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in microfinance.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":594775,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"To

She will use the loan to manage repair needs of the vehicles and legal follow-ups like licenses and registrations. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n\r\nRosejean dreams of being able to give her child a good and high-quality education through all her hard work in her business.

This is Minerva F., 41, resident of Dasmari\u00f1as, Cavite City, Philippines. Already widowed at such a young age; she manages to be mother and father to four children, one of whom is already in high school, while the younger children are enrolled in elementary school. By the grace of God, Minerva has managed to support her older child's schooling. At this time, she is working hard to be able to send all of them all the way through college--a dream for most Filipino parents like Minerva as she herself has been a college undergraduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents could leave to their children.\r\n\r\nMinerva operates a food stall where her main products are mostly breakfast fare. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals in the evenings when all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one or two people when buying cooked rice and viands costs less than raw food. Minerva's regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php 200 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 15,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more products such as meat, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nMinerva dreams of being able to give all her children a good, high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She also hopes to have her own stall someday, so that she can save her rent money and use it for her children. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":594879,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"buy

He has four children between the ages of 5 and 12; the 3 eldest go to school.  Ernesto only finished sixth grade and did not continue because of his parents' financial troubles.  He and his family live in his own house, which his parents gave to him, and he supports his parents, who live with him.\r\n\r\nHe left his hometown to come to Boane with his parents.  Ernesto has been a stonemason for more than 15 years and works with three helpers.  He earns about 3,500 meticais per month after paying his helpers, and he manages to save some money at home for unforeseen circumstances.\r\n\r\nHe has never had loans with other banks.

M. was born in 1970. She is single and God has blessed her with children. She shares three rooms with her children and other external family members. She lives in Musang mankon, a quarter in Bamenda in the Northwest Region of Cameroon.\r\n\r\nShe has encountered difficulties in life ranging from the inability to provide for her daily needs to the failure to attain quality education. She also reiterates how happy she was when she gave birth to a set of twins. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Shirri plans to invest in the business of buying and selling of foodstuffs like cocoa yams, yams, corn, potatoes and beans. She is convinced that the business will succeed because this is not her first time receiving a loan from GHAPE and investing in the same business, and also that the previous investment was successful. The loan will help her community because she will be able to provide general provisions in the form of food items. Her neighbors will not need to incur transportation costs to buy them elsewhere in distant places. \r\n\r\nWith her income from the business she will be able to take care of her children\u2019s education. She will plow back her profits into her business and use part to care for her family. She will use a fraction of the profit to upgrade her standard of living. She also wants to open a workshop for her son. \r\n\r\nShe prefers GHAPE because of the training she frequently receives, the follow up, and also that GHAPE does not ask for collateral securities, and the low cost in obtaining and paying back a loan, and that payment is gradual.\r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instills a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":714.3,"image":{"id":594951,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"purchase general provisions to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Musang, Bamenda, NW.

She is married to Neba Clement Ngwa and they are blessed with five children. She shares five rooms with her five children, where they live at Musang, a quarter in Bamenda North West Region of Cameroon.\n\nEmelia has faced difficulties in life ranging from ill-health, the inability to meet her daily needs, and the untimely death of her relatives. Her failure to attain a quality education has contributed to her inability to afford basic necessities like lighting. With this loan, she plans to invest it in her food buying and selling business which she has had for several years.  She is convinced that the business will succeed because she has a business strategy that is unique. She also thinks her business site has a lot to do with her success since it is located inside the main market of her village. Also, she sees her low price policy as a tool to capture customers which adds to her success in business. The loan will help her community because they will be able to afford foodstuffs at relatively low prices and will not need to incur the transport costs to buy food from distant places. \n\nThe profit from her loan will help her to take care of her children\u2019s education. She will put back her profit into her business and use part of it to care for her family. She will use a fraction of the profit to pay for her children Meducation when they are sick and upgrade her standard of living. She prefers GHAPE because of the training she frequently receives, the follow up, and the low cost in obtaining and paying back a loan.\n\n\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instils a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\n\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":594953,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase beans, vegetables and cassava.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Musang, Bamenda, NW.

Over the years Gladys has worked very hard in her plantations to yield high quality harvests.

What she most enjoys about her work is the harvest. She has 10 years' experience in the field. The most difficult part of the work is having to transport the harvest to the markets where it will be sold. In time she hopes to cultivate the entire expanse of her fields to increase production. This loan is the first she requests through MFP (Kiva Field Partner) and she is committed to the responsibilities of the loan.  She wishes to acquire future loans to keep developing her business.

Los verdes campos del poblado de Huaracayo (Distrito de la provincia de Tarma), han sido en la vida de Luzmila un lugar muy agradable para trabajar, desde muy peque\u00f1a sus padres le ense\u00f1aron esta labor y ahora ella tiene sus propias tierras en las que trabaja con mucho esmero y sacrificio. Lo que m\u00e1s le gusta de su trabajo es cultivar arvejas y choclos, lleva 21 a\u00f1os realizando esta actividad y considera que lo m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil es transportar sus cultivos, hasta el lugar donde los vende en el mercado de Tarma. Con el tiempo, espera poner un peque\u00f1o puesto en el mercado, ya que siente que pierde mucho al vender sus productos al por mayor. Este es el octavo cr\u00e9dito con MFP, sabe que tiene la responsabilidad de pagar todas sus cuotas puntualmente y est\u00e1 dispuesta a hacerlo.

She lives in her mother-in-law's house with her husband Fredy, who is 26, and her dear son Bryan, to whom she wishes to offer a good education.  The green fields of Huaracayo (a district of Tarma province) have always been a feature of Luzmila's life.  This is a very agreeable place to work.  Since she was very small, Luzmila's parents taught her farming skills and, now, she has her own lands in which she works with much care and sacrifice.\r\n\r\nWhat Luzmila likes most about her work is cultivating vetch and corn.  She has been doing this for 21 years.  What she considers most difficult is transporting her harvests to where she sells them, the market of Tarma.  In time, she hopes to establish a small stall in the market, because she believes she loses much by selling them at wholesale.\r\n\r\nThis is her 8th loan with MFP, and she understands the responsibility of making all her payments punctually which she is disposed to do.  Within her communal bank she is always up to date on the agreements they arrive at.\r\n\r\nWith the 1,000 new sols she requests Luzmila will buy vetch seeds, since this leguminous plant is selling very well in the market.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Harold Sims, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":595008,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"BUYING VETCH SEEDS TO SOW ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-09-03T18:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luzmila ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:37:45Z","rounded_local_amount":1048.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201326939,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-09-05T03:11:14Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T11:37:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":228763,"name":"Kossivi","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"A. kossivi a une moto qu'il exploite comme un taxi moto, ayant remarqu\u00e9 la rentabilit\u00e9 de ce type d'activit\u00e9 , il souhaite acheter une moto de plus pour accro\u00eetre ses revenus raison pour laquelle il sollicite de WAGES un second cr\u00e9dit. il a d\u00e9j\u00e0 obtenu de WAGES un cr\u00e9dit qu'il a bien rembours\u00e9. il est mari\u00e9 et p\u00e8re de 4 enfants.","en":"Kossivi A. has a motorcycle that he uses as a taxi, having noticed the profitability of such a service.

She lives in her own home with her husband Oscar, 29, and she works with him on a farm.  Together, they want to provide a better life for their beloved son, Aldair.  Working arduously each day in their fields, Marcela is changing their lives.  With her husband she plants beans, corn, and gladioli, which they sell in the markets of Tarma and La Merced, since this is where they can obtain the best prices.  What she likes most about her work is to care for the plantings so that they remain free of diseases and pests.  She has been doing this work for 19 years, and what she considers most difficult is to take her products to the markets where they are sold, since she must carry sacks that are very heavy.  In the future, she hopes to improve her crops and in this way obtain better prices.  This is her 8th loan with MFP, and she feels that this loan will be very beneficial in helping her to grow as a farmer.  In her communal bank she is a very active and cooperative member.  With the 3,000 Peruvian soles that she requests, she will buy 5 sacks of pea seeds.  She will use all of the loan proceeds this way, since each sack is costing her 600 soles.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":595012,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy 5 sacks of pea seeds","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-09-03T18:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marcela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1075}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1075,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:38:04Z","rounded_local_amount":3006.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201326940,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-09-12T13:31:03Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T11:38:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":228766,"name":"Ida Marie Claire","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"cette femme exerce depuis 2003 le commerce de produits d'alimentation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. elle s'approvisionne au grand march\u00e9 de Lom\u00e9. sa client\u00e8le se compose de toutes personnes. elle fait face en ce moment \u00e0 une baisse de son stock de marchandises. elle sollicite un cr\u00e9dit qui va lui permettre d'augmenter son stock avec 10 sacs de riz, 15 bidons d'huile et 1 cartons de sucre. elle est mari\u00e9e et m\u00e8re de 3 enfants.","en":"Since 2003 this woman has been a retail merchant of general food products.

Dina tiene planeado invertir el cr\u00e9dito solicitado en la compra de cantidad de mercader\u00eda en productos de belleza, adem\u00e1s de accesorios para ofrecer mayor variedad a sus clientes. \n\n","en":"Dina, 37, lives in a house that she owns with her husband, Manuel, 36, and their 2 young children.  Every day is a work day for this tireless woman.  She has to get up very early to care for her children so that she can then tend the business that she runs from her house.  She started the business, selling beauty products, 7 years ago after a friend recommended it.  She hasn't stopped working since and she hasn't allowed anyone or anything to keep her from making it a success and, in turn, providing her family with the extra income they need to get ahead.  She says that, over time, she has built up an ever-larger base of customers who, in turn, bring in other customers, a process that allows her to grow her business and increase her earnings.  Her hard work and the success she's had paid off when she was made the senior rep in her neighborhood, something that qualifies her for a greater income, bonuses, etc.  Dina is always thinking ahead.  She is considering increasing the quantity of goods that she displays in the space that she has set aside for the business.  This is her sixth MFP loan and she is committed to repaying it on time because she wants to continue working with the bank.  In addition to the merchandise she has long sold, Dina is thiking of adding a wider range of related products.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":595031,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"Buy products to resell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-09-03T19:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1700,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":249.28},{"due_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":267.92},{"due_date":"2010-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":275.95},{"due_date":"2010-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":288.79},{"due_date":"2011-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":303.18},{"due_date":"2011-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":314.88}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.65},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":98.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101.45},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.17},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":111.47},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.76}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":91.65,"local_amount":249.28,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:16Z","rounded_local_amount":256.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172154586,"comment":null},{"amount":98.5,"local_amount":267.92,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:14:24Z","rounded_local_amount":275.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449898,"comment":null},{"amount":101.45,"local_amount":275.95,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:59:57Z","rounded_local_amount":283.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588598,"comment":null},{"amount":106.17,"local_amount":288.79,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:04:47Z","rounded_local_amount":296.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188725101,"comment":null},{"amount":111.47,"local_amount":303.18,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:39:27Z","rounded_local_amount":311.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191463197,"comment":null},{"amount":115.76,"local_amount":314.88,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:52:58Z","rounded_local_amount":323.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195886603,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-09-16T12:36:11Z","paid_date":"2011-03-24T08:52:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":228772,"name":"Rosslinda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nLa socia pertenece al banco comunal \u201cVIRGEN DE LA O\u201d; La socia est\u00e1 ubicada en el distrito de Yucay, perteneciente a la provincia de Urubamba y departamento de Cusco.\n\nLa socia es la Srta.

She shares the work of managing the stall with an assistant so that they can take turns opening up shop.  She says proudly that her stall is open for business from Monday to Friday, and weekends are devoted entirely to producing glass handicrafts.  Dora enjoys shaping the glass, painting it, and finishing shaping it to produce a product that decorates rooms around the world.  Her excellent customer service skills generate a good income, which allows her to raise her child without difficulty.\r\n\r\nBecause Dora is such an enterprising woman, she plans to expand her business by stocking her stall with a variety of merchandise in order to offer the best to her customers.  This is her first loan with Kiva Partner MFP and she promises to complete her payments on time so as not to disappoint all the people who have put their trust in her.

She is a single mother with 2 children who are reliant on her: 11 year-old Roberto Mario, who they call Tito, and Linda Patricia (Pati), who is 6. And the baby who will be born in a few months will be a girl, and she is eager to hold her in her arms. \r\nShe has been an elementary school teacher for 11 years. She teaches in a community called Madero, which is some distance from where she lives. But she is still doing well and has been able to help her family get ahead. People treat her well thanks to the service that she gives to her students and they don't want her to leave her work for any reason because she is a good person.\r\nShe says that she requested a loan to buy materials for her craft production, being: thread, rings, wood, and needles to make hammocks, bags, landscape pictures, and swings. She has been doing this work for 10 months and says that it is going well as her customers buy in bulk and she gives them payment schemes.  \r\nWith the income that she makes from her sales, she buys more material so she can make more crafts, and every day she has more income and will be able to repay the loan that she is requesting from Fundac\u00edon Realidad and the loan will give her better work opportunities. \r\nShe wants to be able to save so that in time she can build a larger house and make her children comfortable. She also wants to have a stationary store where she can sell high-quality goods. She wants this so her children can have a good education and good future.  \r\nMacarena became part of the group when her friend, Flor Delva, who is the group's representative for the loan, invited her. She was interested because the loan payments are easy and the interest is low, so she joined. The group is called \"Ori\u00f3n\" because where they work there is a street of that name. \r\nThere are 4 women in the group and each has a different business, being:\r\nMacarena will use the loan to buy materials to make crafts such as hammocks, swings, pictures, and bags. \r\nFlor Delva will use the loan to buy and sell shoes, sandals, and women's bags.\r\nMar\u00eda Elid\u00eda will use the loan to buy catalogs to sell shoes from the Impulso and Maga brands.\r\nAdalia will use the loan to buy catalogs from Fuller, Jafra, and Blondy to sell perfumes, deodorants, and other goods.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Alison Hynd, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":591793,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":"la compra de materiales para la elaboracion de hamacas, cuadros, mecedoras entre otros.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"COPAINAL\u00c1, CHIAPAS","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2010-09-03T22:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Macarena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Flor Delva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Elidia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adalea","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":15000,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2010-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2010-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2010-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2010-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2010-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2010-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1875}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.88},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.87},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":146.88},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":146.87},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":146.88},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":146.87},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":146.88},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":146.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":293.75,"local_amount":3750,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T08:53:59Z","rounded_local_amount":3831.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172121203,"comment":null},{"amount":146.88,"local_amount":1875,"processed_date":"2010-10-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:25:45Z","rounded_local_amount":1915.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177415350,"comment":null},{"amount":146.87,"local_amount":1875,"processed_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:26:14Z","rounded_local_amount":1915.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177415351,"comment":null},{"amount":293.75,"local_amount":3750,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:16:21Z","rounded_local_amount":3831.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182554957,"comment":null},{"amount":265.37,"local_amount":3387.72,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:17:29Z","rounded_local_amount":3461.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188691447,"comment":null},{"amount":28.38,"local_amount":362.28,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:45:00Z","rounded_local_amount":370.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191430867,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-09-04T04:14:05Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T03:45:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":228782,"name":"Tlatoani Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Este Grupo solidario se llama Tlatoani, esta ubicado en Tlayacapan, en el estado de Morelos, esta conformado por 4 integrantes que se conocen y son vecinos y est\u00e1n muy contentos con el pr\u00e9stamo que le proporcionan.\nLos integrantes del grupo son el se\u00f1or Eutimio G\u00f3mez T. va a comprar con su pr\u00e9stamo madera (polines), tablas, etc. para tener madera para cimbrar el es alba\u00f1il, el se\u00f1or Humberto Eduardo Mart\u00ednez Rodr\u00edguez va a comprar hojas para tamal, carne, chiles secos, leche, canela, az\u00facar, arroz para elaborar sus tamales y su atole, la se\u00f1ora Antolina Cornelio X.

It is made up of 4 members. They all know each other and are neighbors. They are all very happy for the loan they have requested. \r\n\r\nEutimio G. Torrez will purchase wood and wood planks with his loan to use in his work. He is a construction worker. Humberto Eduardo M. R. will purchase corn husks, meat, dried chilies, milk, sugar, cinnamon and rice to make tamales and warm corn flour drinks.   Antolina Cornelio X. F. will purchase new catalogues to restock her business with linen and blankets in various sizes.  Maria Elena O. M. will purchase a grill, chairs, sacks of corn on the cob, cheeses, powdered chili for the corn, and for corn drink. \r\n\r\nHumberto Eduardo M. R. is the representative of the group. He is 40 years old and he has a grade 9 education. He lives together with his wife and their 6-year old daughter named Anel. She attends primary school. Humberto requests a loan to invest in his business, selling corn flour drinks and tamales. He will use it to purchase corn husks, lard, meats, cups, spoons, napkins, sugar, chilies, corn flour, milk, cinnamon and rice. He started his business 20 years ago for the lack of paid work. He used to work one or two days a week so he started selling corn drinks and tamales. His business has been very successful. He started out selling his products from buckets but with time he started to save money and he purchased an adult tricycle which helped him to go all over town. He goes to gas stations and along the streets to sell his corn drinks and tamales. He sells to the entire population of the village and to tourists that stop to purchase ornate clay objects and pottery.  He is proud of his business because with it he has been able to purchase a plot of land where he lives and where he is building a house. The house where he lives is made of wood and aluminum sheeting, but he is saving money to make the walls out of bricks and the roof of concrete. \r\n\r\nHe faces competition from others that work in the same business, selling the same products. He invests his earnings in part to cover the family\u2019s expenses, in part to continue building their house, and he also invests a part of his earnings back into the business. \r\n\r\nWhat he enjoys most of his work is completing a sale. It is very important because it feeds and supports his family. His dreams are to see his house completed and beautiful. He also wishes to see his daughter attend school and achieve a career and a have a good job. He is very happy and content and in good health. He is glad about the loan he is granted he wishes to thank Kiva and Fundacion Realidad for the trust imparted to them by this loan and future loans. \r\n\r\nThe village of Tlayacapan is quiet and clam and every one knows the members of the group. The region is very friendly and it is known by tourists for its clay pottery. It is a lovely village where everything is green with vegetation and there is a magical history of the surrounding mountains, commonly known as The Little Sombrero, Butterfly, and The Little Window. The church was once a convent. It is also the birthplace of chinelos, colorfully dressed dancers.  In the months of February and March up to 5 days before Ash Wednesday there are weekly fairs, on Friday to Tuesday every week.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Erika Lindig, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1400,"image":{"id":593982,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase corn husks, lard, meats, cups, spoons, napkins, sugar, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Tlayacapan, estado de Morelos","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2010-09-07T14:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eutimio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Humberto Eduardo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Antolina Cornelia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":18000,"loan_amount":1400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2010-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2010-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2010-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2010-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":2250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":350,"local_amount":4500,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:11:09Z","rounded_local_amount":4564.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172121204,"comment":null},{"amount":175,"local_amount":2250,"processed_date":"2010-10-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:25:40Z","rounded_local_amount":2282.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177415352,"comment":null},{"amount":175,"local_amount":2250,"processed_date":"2010-10-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:26:05Z","rounded_local_amount":2282.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177415353,"comment":null},{"amount":525,"local_amount":6750,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:16:24Z","rounded_local_amount":6847.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182554958,"comment":null},{"amount":95.13,"local_amount":1223.16,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:17:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1240.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188691448,"comment":null},{"amount":79.87,"local_amount":1026.84,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:44:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1041.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191430868,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-09-09T19:17:14Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T03:44:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":228783,"name":"Mirta","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mirtha, de 51 a\u00f1os, vive en su casa que es propia, que esta hecha de material noble, en compa\u00f1\u00eda de su esposo Sergio de 53 a\u00f1os y de su joven hija Mayra de 18 a\u00f1os, pues sus otros 5 hijos son mayores e independientes.

Desde hace 1 a\u00f1o se asoci\u00f3 con una amiga en el negocio de crianza y venta de pollos. Dice que el trabajo es tranquilo, ya que solo deben brindar lo necesario para que los polluelos crezcan sin dificultad y as\u00ed despu\u00e9s de un mes los venden a buenos precios a sus amigos y conocidos, que los requieren para consumo o para comercializarlos. Lo que no le gusta es que muchas veces los pollos enferman debido a que son bastante delicados; pero lo que le agrada es que crecen con rapidez, de esta manera puede obtener ganancias con regular frecuencia. Dice que es un negocio bastante rentable, ya que las rentas  le permiten ayudar a su esposo con los gastos del hogar. Como es una mujer bastante emprendedora, en adelante tiene planeado ampliar este negocio, y para esto quiere, junto con su amiga, comprar un terreno para aumentar la cantidad de polluelos y criarlos con mayor espacio. Es la segunda vez que tiene un cr\u00e9dito con MFP, y promete pagar puntualmente sus cuotas para no defraudar a todas las personas que hicieron posible el cr\u00e9dito que le permitir\u00e1 continuar trabajando. Graciela tiene planeado invertir  el cr\u00e9dito solicitado en la compra de alimento y engorde para los pollos, y de esta manera espera que crezcan con mayor rapidez, para despu\u00e9s comercializarlos y generarse buenas ganancias. \n\n","en":"37 year old Graciela lives with her husband, 38 year old Primitivo, who installs cables, and their 2 small children. For the past year she has worked with a friend raising and selling chickens. She says that the work is straightforward as they only have to provide what is necessary for the chickens to grow without difficulty and then, after one month, they sell them at a good price to their friends and acquaintances, who need them for food or to sell. She doesn't like that the chickens often become sick because they are quite delicate, but she is pleased that they grow quickly and so they can get regular income. She says that this business is quite profitable and the income enables her to help her husband with the household expenses. As she is an enterprising woman, in the future she plans to grow the business and for this she and her friend need to buy some land to increase the number of chickens they can keep and raise them in more space. This is the second loan that she has had from MFP, and she promises to make her repayments punctually so as to not disappoint all the people who have made the loan possible and are helping her to continue working. Graciela plans to use the loan to buy food and fatten-up the chickens, and so have them grow more quickly so they can sell them and generate good profits. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Alison Hynd, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":595111,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy chicken feed.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-09-03T22:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Graciela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":122.9},{"due_date":"2010-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":138.75},{"due_date":"2010-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":142.52},{"due_date":"2010-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":148.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":153.15},{"due_date":"2011-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":159.34},{"due_date":"2011-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":165.75},{"due_date":"2011-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":168.92}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.09},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.03},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.44},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.76},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.43},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.75},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.16},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":46.09,"local_amount":122.9,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:20Z","rounded_local_amount":128.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172154593,"comment":null},{"amount":52.03,"local_amount":138.75,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:14:40Z","rounded_local_amount":145.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449905,"comment":null},{"amount":53.87,"local_amount":143.66,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:59:50Z","rounded_local_amount":150.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588604,"comment":null},{"amount":55.33,"local_amount":147.53,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:05:09Z","rounded_local_amount":154.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188725109,"comment":null},{"amount":57.43,"local_amount":153.15,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:39:44Z","rounded_local_amount":160.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191463204,"comment":null},{"amount":69.89,"local_amount":186.37,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:52:52Z","rounded_local_amount":195.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195886609,"comment":null},{"amount":63.24,"local_amount":168.63,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:37:19Z","rounded_local_amount":176.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201326944,"comment":null},{"amount":52.12,"local_amount":139.01,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:41:36Z","rounded_local_amount":145.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211270325,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-09-04T10:01:14Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T11:41:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":228795,"name":"Epifania","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Epifania S. is 24, married, and has six children aged between two and eight.

He is grateful to Ceprodel for the loans granted that have helped him stock his business.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":595115,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy meat at wholesale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Condega","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":74,"posted_date":"2010-10-02T07:10:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Felix Pedro ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":4000,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":347},{"due_date":"2010-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":361},{"due_date":"2010-11-06T07:00:00Z","amount":370},{"due_date":"2010-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":384},{"due_date":"2011-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":392},{"due_date":"2011-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":402},{"due_date":"2011-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":422},{"due_date":"2011-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":430},{"due_date":"2011-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":444},{"due_date":"2011-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":448}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.35},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.05},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.2},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.6},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.1},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.1},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.5},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.2},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.4}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":35.4,"local_amount":708,"processed_date":"2010-10-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:21:53Z","rounded_local_amount":762.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177382703,"comment":null},{"amount":18.5,"local_amount":370,"processed_date":"2010-11-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:32:43Z","rounded_local_amount":398.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182520305,"comment":null},{"amount":19.2,"local_amount":384,"processed_date":"2010-12-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:43:37Z","rounded_local_amount":413.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188654677,"comment":null},{"amount":19.6,"local_amount":392,"processed_date":"2011-01-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:30:04Z","rounded_local_amount":421.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191397799,"comment":null},{"amount":20.1,"local_amount":402,"processed_date":"2011-02-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:29:52Z","rounded_local_amount":432.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195815969,"comment":null},{"amount":21.1,"local_amount":422,"processed_date":"2011-03-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:38:49Z","rounded_local_amount":454.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201258374,"comment":null},{"amount":21.5,"local_amount":430,"processed_date":"2011-04-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:34:32Z","rounded_local_amount":462.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206125152,"comment":null},{"amount":22.2,"local_amount":444,"processed_date":"2011-05-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:50:25Z","rounded_local_amount":477.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211197003,"comment":null},{"amount":22.4,"local_amount":448,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:44:14Z","rounded_local_amount":482.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216475453,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-10-04T03:09:45Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T10:44:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":228797,"name":"Fanuafou","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fanuafou V. is 28, married, and has two children aged six and eight.

Dice que a diario debe despertarse al amanecer, pues sus proveedores le dejan los pollos a esa hora, y empieza su labor  en el mercado a partir de  las 8 de la ma\u00f1ana hasta las 4 de la tarde. Esta muy satisfecha pues obtiene buenas ventas ya que sus caseras la buscan por la calidad de los pollos que ofrece, y tambi\u00e9n por los precios c\u00f3modos. A veces se siente algo cansada pues como trabaja todos los d\u00edas,  no descansa durante  los fines de semana ni feriados, a veces desea un descanso, pero sabe que con mucho esfuerzo y sacrificio saldr\u00e1 adelante, ya que quiere el progreso de su familia. Y como siempre se proyecta para el futuro ya tiene pensado aumentar la cantidad de pollos que ofrece, adem\u00e1s quiere mejorar las instalaciones de su negocio, para proyectar una buena imagen.

She says that she has to arise every day at dawn because that\u2019s when her suppliers deliver the chickens.

She will buy quintales of corn, pork, lard, a quintal of beans to increase sales.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":595142,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"Will buy quintales (weight measure equivalent to 46 kilos) of corn, lard, pork and other ingredients for Nacatamales (Nicaraguan tamales popular as weekend fare) like quintales of beans to increase production.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2010-09-03T23:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":950,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yelba Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":20000,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.16},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.16},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.16},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":81.11,"local_amount":1707.51,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T07:46:27Z","rounded_local_amount":1746.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172205228,"comment":null},{"amount":77.22,"local_amount":1625.83,"processed_date":"2010-10-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T12:01:39Z","rounded_local_amount":1662.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177330932,"comment":null},{"amount":158.45,"local_amount":3335.72,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-19T09:09:50Z","rounded_local_amount":3411.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189098215,"comment":null},{"amount":79.05,"local_amount":1664.29,"processed_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T00:46:00Z","rounded_local_amount":1702.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191348784,"comment":null},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":1666.67,"processed_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:04:58Z","rounded_local_amount":1704.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195766467,"comment":null},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":1666.67,"processed_date":"2011-03-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T09:56:07Z","rounded_local_amount":1704.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201209509,"comment":null},{"amount":237.5,"local_amount":5000.01,"processed_date":"2011-06-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:25:03Z","rounded_local_amount":5113.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216432930,"comment":null},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":1666.67,"processed_date":"2011-07-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:03:07Z","rounded_local_amount":1704.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221597931,"comment":null},{"amount":79.16,"local_amount":1666.63,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:09:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1704.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238531168,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-09-15T15:43:55Z","paid_date":"2011-11-15T09:09:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":228817,"name":"Ang\u00e9lica Mar\u00eda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"En las afueras de  Portoviejo, ciudad hermosa conocida como la ciudad de Los Reales Tamarindos, por la cantidad de arboles que hab\u00edan de este fruto.

N. is from the village of San Pedro, Dapitan City, Zamboanga del Norte, Philippines. She is 31 years old. Michelle is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Michelle owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from raising pigs for sale. Michelle has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 3,500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Michelle joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Michelle has successfully repaid a previous loan of 11,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used as additional capital for fish vending. Michelle is requesting a new loan of 11,000 PHP which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise & sell in future. This will be the 7th loan taken out by Michelle from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Mairtes has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from PMPC. Marites is requesting a new loan of 14,900 PHP which will be used as additional capital for the business.

It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":583861,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Additional capital for hog raising","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Northern Poblacion, Calamba Mis.

What made things worse was that she accumulated family expenses every 15 days, but there was not enough money to cover them.  Nelly decided to work by herself at first, but then she began helping another woman sell food and gradually learned the business.  She bought a few small pots and a table so that she could begin cooking and selling food to the workers at a bus stop.  Nelly was afraid of failing, so she was surprised when she ran out of food because she had gotten off to a great start.  She is determined to move her business forward now that she has many customers, most of whom are drivers and fare collectors who buy the food she prepares.  Nelly prepares meals and soups, which she sells more of now that the weather is colder.  She is very happy that she can help her husband with paying for their children\u2019s education and making improvements to their home.  Nelly wants to have her own restaurant in the near future even though the thought makes her apprehensive.  \r\n<p>\r\nHer loan will be used to buy ingredients and supplies in bulk, which will help her save more and generate better earnings.  The Communal Bank \u201cMadres Ladere\u00f1as\u201d is a new group and Nelly was recently named its President.  The group consists of ten members who plan to work together.  They all live in the district of Puente Piedra in Lima, Peru.  \r\n<p>\r\nSra. Nelly is the woman in the back wearing a pink sweatshirt and gray vest.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1375,"image":{"id":595456,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase ingredients & supplies in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Puente Piedra","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.870278 -77.086111","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2010-09-14T15:57:24Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Bella Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Reynalda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sonia Ricardina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Nelly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Maritza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Humberto Gerardo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Ana Melva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Concepcion","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nancy Flor","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3800,"loan_amount":1375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":950},{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":950},{"due_date":"2010-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":950},{"due_date":"2011-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":950}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":343.75},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":343.75},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":343.75},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":343.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":343.75,"local_amount":950,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:36:17Z","rounded_local_amount":961.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177390860,"comment":null},{"amount":343.75,"local_amount":950,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:43:38Z","rounded_local_amount":961.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182529140,"comment":null},{"amount":343.75,"local_amount":950,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:52:20Z","rounded_local_amount":961.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188665248,"comment":null},{"amount":343.75,"local_amount":950,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:52:03Z","rounded_local_amount":961.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191408512,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-09-15T14:52:15Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T02:52:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":228855,"name":"Mujeres Buscando Un Futuro Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Consuelo tiene 40 a\u00f1os vive en San Martin D.

She is 61 years old. Nellie is the group leader of a 3-member group loan offered by PMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Nellie Q. Group.\r\n\r\nNellie is married and has 3 adult children. To make a living, Nellie owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector running a general store, selling a variety of different products in the local community. Nellie has been engaged in her business for over 31 years and earns approximately 3000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Nellie joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Nellie has successfully repaid a previous loan of 13000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. Nellie is requesting a new loan of 14900 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the 9th loan taken out by Nellie from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is married to Romeo C., a farmer. Adela and her family live in a municipality called the North Peninsula of Antique which is Pandan. The place is rich in natural resources. Pandan is surrounded by verdant mountains and blue ocean that sparkles during the daytime.\r\n\r\nAdela has been practicing her knowledge of dealing with different people by operating a sari-sari (variety) store for the past three years. This has been her business and her source of income. The profit she has made has helped her husband a lot to augment the family income. Her previous loan from ASHI supported her business and her husband's farming ventures. Since she was able to repay her previous loan, she is now qualified to apply for another loan of a higher amount to support her business. Now, she plans to utilize this loan and her future loans in the same business until it grows. She wishes that someday she could set up a mini-grocery store in their village where she can provide her customers with convenient purchases.\r\n\r\nAdela's aspiration is that all her children will graduate from college with degrees and have a good life. This is the reason why she wants her business to succeed. Through business success, Adela hopes to build her own dream house. Her loan from Kiva through ASHI is a very important factor that could lead her towards fulfillment of her dreams.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":595613,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To

G. is from the city of Dipolog.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from providing hairdressing and beauty services to local community members. Leselda has been engaged in her business for over 16 years and earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Leselda joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She is requesting a loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to purchase materials needed to provide services. This will be the first loan that Leselda has taken out from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in north-western Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Flordeliza is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. This will be the third loan that Flordeliza has taken out from PMPC.

Her middle son and the youngest son work as salesmen in a department store. None of her children could complete their education due to financial reasons and had to leave their education to help support the family financially. \r\n\r\nPerveen supports her family financially with her sewing work. She sews clothes for neighborhood clients specifically. She is good at it and gets regular orders. She charges between 100-150 PKRs for each dress which doesn\u2019t feel high to her customers and they give her good orders.  \r\n\r\nShe has applied for a loan from Asasah to financially assist her eldest son with his furniture-making business. With the loan amount he will buy wood, nails and a furniture polisher of good quantity which will enable him to make more furniture for his business and improve his sales. \r\n\r\nPerveen is a regular loan user of Asasah and is on her 4th loan. In every loan year she has been found very responsible in paying back her installments and in attending meetings.

S. is from the village of Guibang.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Josie has been engaged in her business for over 25 years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Josie joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Josie has successfully repaid a previous loan of 9,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Josie is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Josie from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the pioneer microfinance institutions in the Philippines committed to serve the needy in Central and Northern Luzon through socio-economic development and holistic transformation.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Two of her children are college graduates and the youngest is a high school graduate.\r\n\r\nCristina did not want anything in her life other than to give her children a better living, which means their reaching a higher level of education and having a better house to live in someday. The best way Cristina thought to achieve her dream for her children and to make herself happy, was to have her own expanded business and to have grandchildren someday.\r\n\r\nThere is a piece of land which is owned by Cristina's family that can be used for farming. Cristina joined ASHI to obtain a loan which enabled her to utilize their land by planting rice. With the help of her oldest child, Camilo, their business has grown. Her loans have also increased in size as she has repaid her previous loans while maintaining a very good performance in ASHI.\r\n\r\nRecently, Cristina applied for a loan which is intended for her other business endeavor - a hog-fattening business. However, this does not mean that her farming business will be stopped because some portion of her loan will still be used for it. Hog fattening is just Cristina's way of saving in case her farming business has a problem and needs more
