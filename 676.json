She starts work very early in the morning; she and her partner go to their canteen, where they sell breakfasts in the mornings and lunches in the afternoons. At the other stall, she sells braided products. She has been doing this for ten years, and every day is better. So, she hopes to fix up her canteen and provide her customers with greater comfort. She has always enjoyed cooking, even as a young child. Thanks to her cooking, she  makes a good income. This will be her tenth loan with MFP, and she promises to be punctual with the payments of her quotas. With the requested loan, she will purchase products, basic ingredients for making her food, and braided items to stock her business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":876523,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"to buy basic ingredients and corded products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-09-23T23:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ines ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":456.59},{"due_date":"2011-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":477.68},{"due_date":"2011-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":475.86},{"due_date":"2011-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":513.25},{"due_date":"2012-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":532.39},{"due_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":544.23}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":167.42},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175.15},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":174.48},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":188.19},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":195.21},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":199.55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":167.42,"local_amount":456.59,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:49:06Z","rounded_local_amount":458.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232851383,"comment":null},{"amount":175.15,"local_amount":477.68,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:56:31Z","rounded_local_amount":479.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238666585,"comment":null},{"amount":174.48,"local_amount":475.86,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:22Z","rounded_local_amount":478.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621734,"comment":null},{"amount":188.19,"local_amount":513.25,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:51:45Z","rounded_local_amount":515.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250835815,"comment":null},{"amount":195.21,"local_amount":532.39,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:18:50Z","rounded_local_amount":534.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245574,"comment":null},{"amount":199.55,"local_amount":544.23,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:31:25Z","rounded_local_amount":546.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263385626,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located near the roadside of their community. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 1,200 in sales every day. She also earns additional income from room rentals in her house.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 33,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMagdalena hopes to add rice grains in her store and prays to God for her family to always be in good health. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.

She is married to Virgilio, a caddie boy, and is the mother of four children. Three of her children are already working while the youngest is still studying in school. Together with her husband, Pacita manages the household while operating a business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses. \r\nPacita has been buying and selling golf balls for several years. She buys the balls at wholesale prices and then sells them at a piece rate. Her store is located outside the Philippine Navy golf course in Fort Bonifacio, which is very accessible to all golf players, who are her immediate customers. Aside from this, she also earns additional income from a small variety store. She earns a minimum of 1,000 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\nTo help her continue to operate her business, Pacita is requesting a loan of 30,000 PHP. She will be using the loan to buy more quantities of quality golf balls to sell. She knows that having a lot of stock will attract more customers to her store. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\nPacita hopes her business grows and dreams of being able to give her children a good future and a high quality education through all her hard work in her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":641.67,"image":{"id":876946,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sporting Good Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy additional stocks of golf balls.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Pasay City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-09-26T11:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pacita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":30000,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:35:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1267.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232764663,"comment":null},{"amount":116.66,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:37:10Z","rounded_local_amount":5070.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238571786,"comment":null},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:31:49Z","rounded_local_amount":5070.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244529336,"comment":null},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:39:31Z","rounded_local_amount":5070.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250738553,"comment":null},{"amount":116.66,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:48:15Z","rounded_local_amount":5070.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257145807,"comment":null},{"amount":145.84,"local_amount":6250,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:01:30Z","rounded_local_amount":6337.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263274796,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-09-30T02:01:03Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":338852,"name":"Chanthorn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Chanthorn is a 28-year-old housewife.

When Fatma requested her first loan, she was newly separated from her husband and living in her neighbor\u2019s wooden shed with her six-year-old son.  Neighbors suggested that she should take a loan from Maya to open up new possibilities for her future.  \r\n\r\nFatima's life has changed since meeting with a Maya loan officer.  She was accepted into a group and received a loan for $450.  With a small part of the loan she found a small place to rent and bought some furniture and other household items.  With the remaining money, she went to Istanbul and bought some loose beads and some things for the boh\u00e7a trade (usually cheaply made pajamas, clothes, table clothes, etc. that are wrapped up a cloth and carried on one\u2019s back to sell around the neighborhoods).  Sometimes Fatima took her boh\u00e7a on her back to make sales and sometimes she made prayer beads from the loose beads she had bought and sold them at mosques and on street corners.  She repaid her first loan and requested another.  With her second loan she bought more items for the boh\u00e7a trade.\r\n\r\nOn the days she was not out selling, Fatima was planting and raising vegetable seedling in an unused garden spot next to her house.  She took the seedlings and started to sell them at the local bazaar.  She saw that she could earn more money raising vegetable seedlings.  She repaid her second loan.  For her third through fifth loans she concentrated on expanding the areas where she could raise seedlings and planted produce to sell in the bazaar.  Her business was going so well that during this time she built a house, bought a vehicle to transport her expanding seedling and produce supplies to the bazaar, and hired a seasonal worker.   \r\n\r\nWith her sixth loan, Fatima will continue to expand her business using the loan to rent additional fields, buy seeds, fertilizer, watering supplies, and materials for a greenhouse. Fatma\u2019s life has changed a lot.  She is now a free and happy woman.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Fatima wants to rent other fields and upgrade her vehicle. She also hopes to own her own fields, so she won\u2019t have to rent but can have her own land and production, and travel to holy places.  She wants her son to be successful in school, his work and make investments for their retirement.\r\n\r\nTranslated from Turkish by Maya Staff\r\n\r\nFatma Han\u0131m 45 ya\u015f\u0131nda ve dul.

Her store is located near the roadside of their community. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of  500 Philippine Pesos (PHP)in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 15,000 loan.

After three correctly reimbursed individual loans, she is now on her fourth loan which will permit her to grow her working capital so as to buy (in Sikasso) five buckets of peanut butter, four cartons of Maggi cubes, three cartons of tomato paste, five sacks of onions, and five cartons of mustard.  \r\n\r\nMadame Mah sells her goods for cash and credit to a clientele composed of all comers. With this loan she expects to make a monthly profit of 100,000 F CFA which she will use to contribute to the family budget, pay the interest on her loan, and invest the remainder back into her business.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":877003,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy condiments.

has been selling clothes and shoes for the last five years. She is separated and has two children, ages 7 and 14 years old. Virginiah has lived in Malindi town for the last 15 years. Malindi is a tourist destination town. The challenge Virginiah faces is when the town is in low season and she receives low sales and more competition from other sellers.\n\nVirginiah has been a Milango client since June 2011. She heard about Milango from her friends and joined a self-help group.

Limited capital leads him to seek a loan from TLM. He wants to buy chicks to raise and fodder as well. He is requesting a loan of 6,000,000 Indonesian rupiah. He is hoping that TLM will assist him in improving his business.

He is a Palestinian National Authority employee with a decent salary.\r\n\r\nMosa wants to replace his old home furniture with new furniture such as beds for his children and seating for the living room in order to provide better living conditions for his family. He does not have enough money to pay for the furniture, so he needs to take out a loan from FATEN. When he gets the loan, which will be repaid on a monthly basis, he will purchase the new furniture. Mosa was photographed at the FATEN branch.\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\n\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see requested includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

is 55 years old and married. She has four children. The youngest child is 23 and the oldest one is 35 years old.\r\n\r\n\"Before I started the trading business, I was a housewife. I raised four kids, but while I was struggling against financial problems, I could buy and sell a very little amount  of goods. Later I decided to open my own shop. Taking the support of my husband and my oldest son, I  opened my own shop. However, I have been through very hard times, and unfortunately I had to close my shop when I could not afford the rent. Back at home, I finished the remaining products by selling them to relatives, and I somehow managed to pay my debts.\" \r\n\r\n\"Just when I thought I was desperate, I discovered Maya. With the loans I borrowed from Maya, I bought new products from a wholesaler and I am back in business in my house. With the loans I borrowed from Maya, I can buy more products with a cheaper total price. My plans for the future are, if my affairs continue to go as fast and as well as they are going now, to open a shop--not in the city center but in a closer spot to my house--and to support my children and grandchildren as much as I can (by means of both financial and psychological support). My family is really important to me.

Este es su segundo cr\u00e9dito en Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa y le gusta por la agilidad con la que puede obtener recursos econ\u00f3micos para su negocio. El quiere extender su sembr\u00edo y para ello necesita comprar plantas y abonos. Un obst\u00e1culo es que no es due\u00f1o de los terrenos por lo que debe arrendarlos pero est\u00e1 seguro de que produciendo m\u00e1s podr\u00e1 mejorar su calidad de vida.\n\nSu gran sue\u00f1o es tener su propio terreno y sabe que con los esfuerzos que ahora realiza podr\u00e1 estar m\u00e1s cerca de conseguirlo.\n","en":"Juan is a 44 year-old man who lives with his family in the Milpe precinct of Los Bancos, a canton in the province of Pichincha. The area around this canton holds an important natural resource, the \"Mindo Nambillo\" Protective Forest. A large area of the canton is covered by grasslands, and the principal economic activity there is cattle-raising. People in the canton also farm palm heart, sugarcane, bananas, and naranjillas over smaller areas.\r\n\r\nThis gentleman works planting <i>naranjilla<\/i>, an exotic fruit that is typical of the region. He has been working independently for eight years, and explains that he learned this type of work from his family and has been doing it his whole life. He also comments that work in the fields is difficult and that he has endured inclement weather, like strong rains, and generally faced the challenges of the countryside. This is his second loan through Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa and he is pleased by the ease with which he has been able to obtain economic resources for his business. He would like to expand his planting and in order to do so, he needs plants and fertilizer. One impediment is that he does not own the land he cultivates, so he has to rent it. Nevertheless, he is sure that producing more will improve his quality of life.\r\n\r\nHis greatest dream is to have his own land, and he knows that his current efforts will bring him closer to achieving that."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":418.24,"image":{"id":877224,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

She sells these crops at the wholesale market in the town of Tarma. In the afternoons, she sells kebabs made from sheep's heart. According to her, she says that she sells an average of 50 pieces daily which helps her earn an extra income. Her main difficulty is the cost of childcare for her daughter, which she pays every month. However, she feels assured as recently she bought a car which she uses to provide public transport. Her current plans are to plant in greater numbers so she can finish off paying for the car. She belongs to the communal bank \u201cProgreso Carita\u201d and this is her 6th loan with MFP; she feels very happy as they support the development of her work. For this reason, she promises to be prompt with her repayments. Yolanda is thinking of planting potatoes of the \"yungay\" and \"unica\" varieties. As she is receiving support, she will invest the money requested to purchase natural fertilizers to spread over her next crops.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":877244,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy sacks of fertilizers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-09-26T14:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yolanda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2011-09-26T20:01:52Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":339035,"name":"Sirende Yg Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Augustine is the facilitator of the Sirende Youth Group.

He lives with his wife, Amanda, his companion for 25 years.  They have 5 children together, 4 of whom still live at home.  They live in a house they own in the small town of Queta.  Milcerio is a farmer, work that he's done for 30 years.  He tells us that before he heads out to his fields, he feeds his donkeys and horses--useful for carrying heavy loads at harvest time--and the 25 head of sheep that he owns.  He grows potatoes, olluco, beans and peas on 5 hectares of land and sells what he harvests at the Tarma wholesale market.  What most bothers him are the plants that he loses to frost and worms.  He doesn't dwell on the problems that he faces, though, choosing instead to fight and overcome them.  He will soon harvest a crop of Andean-variety potatoes and he's sure that he'll be happy with the results.

He makes about 50 PEN a day.  This helps with his income.  He also sells his crops at the wholesale market in the city of Tarma.

Juan is a responsible, hard-working, and above all very entrepreneurial man. Several years ago he managed to establish a small store in his home residence which has allowed him to give his family their daily bread. Keeping the business going has not been easy, expresses Juan, as in the area where he resides there are other businesses that compete with his store, and day by day there are more businesses that by one way or another are gaining ground in the area and consequently taking way customers in their favor. But for Juan this is not an obstacle but rather a challenge since this has made him be alert to the changes in the market. He counts on many advantages since he has a lot of experience and moreover, has already won the trust of his neighbors. The most important thing to him is that his customers are satisfied, which is why he always puts a great deal of effort to have everything they need. Juan is a daring and safe man, and does not fear any challenge. All of this has motivated him to apply to Integral for a loan with the faith in God that in this way he will manage to keep his business running for many more years. With the loan he plans to buy a variety of store items like drinks, rice, sugar, beans, detergent, oil, candy, etc. so that his customers continue to prefer him because of his excellent service. In this way, he hopes to be able to obtain a better opportunity in life for him as well as for his family."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":109.27,"image":{"id":876778,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy a variety of store items like: drinks, rice, sugar, beans, detergent, oil, candy.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2011-09-24T18:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan Francisco","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":20.36},{"due_date":"2011-11-06T07:00:00Z","amount":20.52},{"due_date":"2011-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":21.83},{"due_date":"2012-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":22.11},{"due_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":22.96},{"due_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":24.74},{"due_date":"2012-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":24.73},{"due_date":"2012-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":26.05},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":26.6},{"due_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":27.93},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":28.63},{"due_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":29.69},{"due_date":"2012-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":31.02},{"due_date":"2012-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":31.93},{"due_date":"2012-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":33.28},{"due_date":"2013-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":34.35},{"due_date":"2013-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":35.61},{"due_date":"2013-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":37.66}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.36},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.52},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.83},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.11},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.96},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.74},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.73},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.05},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.6},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.93},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.63},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.69},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.02},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.93},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.28},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.35},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.61},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":20.36,"local_amount":20.36,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:20:01Z","rounded_local_amount":20.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238546119,"comment":null},{"amount":20.52,"local_amount":20.52,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:12:46Z","rounded_local_amount":20.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244505708,"comment":null},{"amount":22.19,"local_amount":22.19,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:18:00Z","rounded_local_amount":22.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250713184,"comment":null},{"amount":21.75,"local_amount":21.75,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:29:18Z","rounded_local_amount":21.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257116037,"comment":null},{"amount":24.45,"local_amount":24.45,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:28:10Z","rounded_local_amount":24.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263241151,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-10-20T02:12:09Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":339091,"name":"Hilda Isabel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Hilda Hisabe\nla se\u00f1orita Hilda Hisabel, desde hace cinco a\u00f1os ella comenz\u00f3 su negocio de venta de tortillas, ya que  su papa falleci\u00f3 y nos comenta que solo su mama no pod\u00eda con todos sus hermanos  por lo que deciodio hacer su negocio propio  y con lo que gana ha logrado seguir estudiando y  y vestirse y con lo que puede aporta a su mama para ayudarla con sus hermanos, para que ellos sigan estudiando, de igual forma esta alegre porque su negocio ha hecho que ella aprendiera a ser independiente  y valorar lo mucho que vale la vida\nella esta solicitando este credito para la compra de productos de usos domesticos y copra de maiz para la elavoracion de tortillas.","en":"Five years ago, Srta.

The reason that Ayde lives alone is because her life partner emigrated to the United States several years ago and with the help of his arduous work she has been able to stay afloat. She is a very entrepreneurial young person with a great desire for self-improvement and seeing her daughter in better conditions than those which she has had. Several years ago she managed to establish a small store in her home residence from which she sells a diversity of products like: candy, oil, sweet bread, cereals, vegetables, shoes, and many other things. This business is the main source of income for Ayde since her husband's situation is not stable and there are some months when she doesn't receive a remittance of money as her husband is not able to rely on a permanent job in the country in which he finds himself. She has been thinking a lot about how to make her store grow and manage to increase the level in sales as for the time being this is the only way to manage to support herself economically. This motivated her to apply to Integral for a loan in order to invest in her store purchasing a variety products such as: vegetables, rice, sugar, beans, sweet bread, drinks, detergent, candy, etc. She sincerely hopes to be able to better her quality of life and that of her family.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":190.54,"image":{"id":876780,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy a variety of products like: vegetables, rice, sugar, beans, sweet bread, drinks, detergent, candies, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2011-09-24T18:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ayde Esperanza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":34.23},{"due_date":"2011-11-06T07:00:00Z","amount":34.91},{"due_date":"2011-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":36.71},{"due_date":"2012-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":37.58},{"due_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":39},{"due_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":41.19},{"due_date":"2012-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":41.97},{"due_date":"2012-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":43.81},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":45.15},{"due_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":46.99},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":48.56},{"due_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":49.9}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.23},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.91},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.71},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.58},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.19},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.97},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.81},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.15},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.99},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.56},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.9}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":38.34,"local_amount":38.34,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:20:17Z","rounded_local_amount":38.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238546120,"comment":null},{"amount":38.04,"local_amount":38.04,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:12:59Z","rounded_local_amount":38.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244505709,"comment":null},{"amount":36.99,"local_amount":36.99,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:16:41Z","rounded_local_amount":36.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250713185,"comment":null},{"amount":37.87,"local_amount":37.87,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:27:56Z","rounded_local_amount":37.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257116038,"comment":null},{"amount":39.3,"local_amount":39.3,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:28:26Z","rounded_local_amount":39.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263241152,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-09-27T10:04:19Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":339093,"name":"Deysi Isabel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nDeysi Isabel de 31 a\u00f1os de edad, reside en casa propia en uno de los municipios mas populosos del pa\u00eds, junto con su grupo familiar que est\u00e1 integrado por su esposo, 3 hijos y su querida madre de 70 a\u00f1os.
