It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC, and communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They live as a family in Dasmarinas, Cavite.\r\n\r\nHer current focus is on making her sari-sari (variety) store survive competition and level up into something like a grocery. Weekly she observes which products sell the most and which brands are the most in demand. Aside from her sari-sari store, she also has a mineral water business. Monthly, Salvacion earns approximately Php 9,500.\r\n\r\nTo help her advance her business, Salvacion is applying for a loan amounting to Php 19,000. She will buy more quick-selling items such as toiletries, canned goods, and instant noodles to add to her inventory of products. She sees this as a sure way to increase her profits over time.\r\n\r\nSalvacion simply dreams of getting away from poverty and giving her family a prosperous life. She desires that as her business grows with the application of every entrepreneurial skill and the spiritual support CCT gives her, every member of her family will experience not only happiness, but joy that transcends all circumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

product line that never ceases to gain regular customers is one that serves the food market. Sarah M., 62, banks on this fact and runs a food micro-enterprise. Sarah is married to Wilfredo, a driver, and together they have raised children who are now in college. Sarah is out to prove that having finished only three years of high school does not limit her in business.\r\n\r\nAt present, Sarah runs a food stall, called a \"carinderia\", in the Philippines. The carinderia is annexed to their house, so she is able to manage both the household chores and the daily routines in the carinderia. This business of hers has been running for 15 years now, and with the diligence she puts into her work and the quality training and spiritual support she receives from CCT*, Sarah manages to earn Php 15,000 net income every month. She has one employee hired to help her with the daily tasks in her carinderia.\r\n\r\nBecause Sarah aims to serve nothing but quality food to her customers, she decided to borrow Php 10,000 to better finance her business. She intends to use this loan money to purchase meat products, vegetables, and other nutritious ingredients to come up with daily sumptuous meals. With this loan, Sarah is also equipped to meet the daily needs of her family and pay for the tuition fees of her children.\r\n\r\nOne challenge Sarah faces is the competition she has in the community, since there are not a few business-minded people like her who have set up food stalls in the vicinity. But Sarah is not going to give up the fight. She holds on to the hope of making her business grow, so that she may be able to finance the education of her children up to college and take care of the family's health.\r\n\r\nAs a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she receives.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay micro finance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":750217,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"purchase

M. is a micro entrepreneur who sees her business as a God-given opportunity to produce wealth. She is 58 years old, and since she runs her own business, the fact that she only reached high school does not seem that important. Estrella is married to Angelo, who runs his own business. They have two children, one of whom is at home while the other works for a living. The family used to live in Pangasinan, but now they reside in Pasay City.\r\n\r\nEstrella runs a sari-sari (variety) store. She runs her store from her home which gives her the ability to manage both her store and house without missing details. She has run her store for the past two-and-a-half years and now she knows what her customers need and want, down to the specific brands and products. Estrella earns 10,000 PHP each month, based on her experience and entrepreneurial learning from CCT*.\r\n\r\nEstrella is requesting a 29,000 PHP loan to expand her business. She will use the loan to buy sacks of rice to sell and to purchase groceries to add to her inventory. Her loan will help her increase her daily income and better meet the needs of her family. Above all else, she sees that the blessings she receives in business are God\u2019s favor upon her and so she depends even more upon the Lord.\r\n\r\nWith God\u2019s help, Estrella does not have any life challenges at present. According to her, there is no challenge too hard to bear when you pray to God. It is Estrella\u2019s desire to be able to serve the Lord full time. As a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group\u2019s weekly fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she received.\r\n\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay micro finance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":750218,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase rice and groceries","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Pasay City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-04-13T14:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Estrella","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":29000,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1208.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1208.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1208.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1208.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1208.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1208.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1208.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1208.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1208.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1208.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1208.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1208.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1208.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1208.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1208.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1208.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1208.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1208.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1208.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1208.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1208.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1208.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1208.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":1208.41}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":168.75,"local_amount":7249.98,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:33:39Z","rounded_local_amount":7271.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206123595,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":4833.32,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:49:46Z","rounded_local_amount":4847.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211194964,"comment":null},{"amount":140.62,"local_amount":6041.65,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:43:04Z","rounded_local_amount":6059.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216474053,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":4833.32,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:31:54Z","rounded_local_amount":4847.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221636834,"comment":null},{"amount":140.63,"local_amount":6041.73,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:40:48Z","rounded_local_amount":6059.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227005170,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-04-18T19:12:23Z","paid_date":"2011-09-15T08:40:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":290110,"name":"Salavmat","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"S.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, has epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients present a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Sherozjon is married and the father of two children. He lives in Isfara, Tajikistan, with his family. He works at home in a special place which is built for a bakery business. In a day he cooks 2-2.5 bag of flour or 450-500 individual breads and sells bread in the market. He has been in this business for 15 years. He would like to get a loan of 6000 Somoni for purchasing flour and coal. Thanks to this loan, he will be able to grow his business further and help feed his family.\r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, Western culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only seven percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients have viable business propositions. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

What she does is buy the chicks or chickens two days from hatching and raises them with the necessary care this type of animal requires.  When they reach the age of 6 weeks and they weigh about five pounds or more they are ready for sale.  \r\n\r\nLocal customer demand for her beautiful chickens has increased lately and sometimes she can\u2019t meet all the demand.  Because of this she\u2019s decided to ask INTEGERAL for a loan to invest in her business and buy a larger number of chicks and chickens as well as supplies needed to maintain them such as: concentrated feed and vaccines to prevent illness.  She has faith in God that these measures will improve her situation and she\u2019ll be able to provide her children with a better

Since she was very young her parents have taught her this work and now she has her own land which she works with Felix, planting coffee, cacoa, achiote and coca leaves with great dedication and sacrifice.  What she likes best about her work is harvesting her lands and the feeling that her hard work has paid off. Elsa has eight years working in this way and she considers the most difficult part to be transporting their crops to the city of San Francisco where the crops are sold. Elsa is requesting this loan to carry out her plan of increased planting of cacao plants since it is one of the plants with the largest market in the world. With time, she hopes to put together sufficient funds to buy new land. This is her fifth credit with MFP, she knows that she has the responsibility to pay all of the payments on time and is ready to do it. Within her communal bank she is always aware of all the agreements that they reach. With the loan she will buy cacao seeds and will increase cacao production. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":750375,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy cocoa seeds ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-04-14T21:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elsa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-04-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":81.47},{"due_date":"2011-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":87.39},{"due_date":"2011-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":90.85},{"due_date":"2011-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":93.46},{"due_date":"2011-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":97.29},{"due_date":"2011-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":102.03},{"due_date":"2011-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":105.47},{"due_date":"2011-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":110.25},{"due_date":"2012-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":114},{"due_date":"2012-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":117.79}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.55},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.77},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.07},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.05},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.48},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.26},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.56},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.34},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.75},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":30.55,"local_amount":81.47,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:41:04Z","rounded_local_amount":85.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211270208,"comment":null},{"amount":32.77,"local_amount":87.39,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:32:00Z","rounded_local_amount":92.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216550227,"comment":null},{"amount":34.07,"local_amount":90.85,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:13:02Z","rounded_local_amount":95.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221718902,"comment":null},{"amount":35.05,"local_amount":93.46,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:42Z","rounded_local_amount":98.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350370,"comment":null},{"amount":36.48,"local_amount":97.29,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:49:11Z","rounded_local_amount":102.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232850865,"comment":null},{"amount":38.26,"local_amount":102.03,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:55:44Z","rounded_local_amount":107.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238665989,"comment":null},{"amount":39.56,"local_amount":105.47,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:46Z","rounded_local_amount":111.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621172,"comment":null},{"amount":41.34,"local_amount":110.25,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:50:43Z","rounded_local_amount":116.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250835332,"comment":null},{"amount":42.75,"local_amount":114,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:17:49Z","rounded_local_amount":120.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245130,"comment":null},{"amount":44.17,"local_amount":117.79,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:31:00Z","rounded_local_amount":124.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263385273,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-04-16T16:25:06Z","paid_date":"2012-03-15T10:31:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":290196,"name":"Ana Julia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"la sra.

She lives in her own house together with her husband Ernesto, age 49, and their 4 beloved children, for whom they would like to provide a better future. Lidia's farmlands are the best, and she keeps them well cared-for. Every day she gets up to make breakfast for her children who go to school. Later, she and her husband get ready to go out to the fields to cultivate their coffee, cacao, palillo [perfume guava] and barbasco plants, products which she later takes to sell in the wholesale centers located in the cities of San Francisco and Kimbiri. What she likes most about her work is the freedom she has to wander through the green fields of her village. She has been doing this work for 22 years, and she thinks the most difficult part is protecting her crops from the pests which attack the buds of the plants. With time, she would like to buy more land to increase her production. This is her fifth loan with MFP, and she knows that she has to make all of her payments punctually if she would like to have access to another loan afterward. In her communal bank, she is a very cheerful and cooperative member. With the loan she is requesting, she will buy insecticides to fumigate her crops against the insects that affect them. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":750393,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy insecticides to fumigate her crops","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-04-15T00:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lidia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-04-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":244.47},{"due_date":"2011-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":262.24},{"due_date":"2011-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":272.63},{"due_date":"2011-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":280.47},{"due_date":"2011-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":291.96},{"due_date":"2011-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":306.16},{"due_date":"2011-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":316.49},{"due_date":"2011-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":330.86},{"due_date":"2012-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":342.1},{"due_date":"2012-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":352.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.6},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.97},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.69},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.51},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.61},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.71},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":113.41},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.56},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":122.58},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":126.36}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":87.6,"local_amount":244.47,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:41:39Z","rounded_local_amount":246.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211270210,"comment":null},{"amount":93.97,"local_amount":262.24,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:32:37Z","rounded_local_amount":263.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216550229,"comment":null},{"amount":97.69,"local_amount":272.63,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:13:37Z","rounded_local_amount":274.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221718904,"comment":null},{"amount":100.51,"local_amount":280.47,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:14:20Z","rounded_local_amount":282.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350372,"comment":null},{"amount":104.61,"local_amount":291.96,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:47:49Z","rounded_local_amount":293.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232850867,"comment":null},{"amount":109.71,"local_amount":306.16,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:56:59Z","rounded_local_amount":308.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238665991,"comment":null},{"amount":113.41,"local_amount":316.49,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:42:26Z","rounded_local_amount":318.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621174,"comment":null},{"amount":118.56,"local_amount":330.86,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:51:20Z","rounded_local_amount":333.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250835334,"comment":null},{"amount":122.58,"local_amount":342.1,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:18:37Z","rounded_local_amount":344.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245132,"comment":null},{"amount":126.36,"local_amount":352.62,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:31:51Z","rounded_local_amount":354.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263385275,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-04-16T21:07:31Z","paid_date":"2012-03-15T10:31:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":290203,"name":"Fatou Kin\u00e9","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Madame Fatou  Kin\u00e9 D. est une femme mari\u00e9e de 41 ans.

She is a very cheerful and hard-working woman who lives in her own house together with her husband Dar\u00edo, age 40, and their 4 beloved children, for whom they would like to provide a better quality of life. The hard work carried out by Margarita together with her husband on their fields has resulted in crops that are very well cared-for, and on sales days, her products are purchased rapidly. Her main source of income is the sale of cacao, coffee and coca leaves, which she sells to the wholesale companies located in the city of San Francisco. What she likes best about her work is harvesting her fields. She has done this work for 17 years, and she thinks the most difficult part is protecting her crops from the insect pests that can affect her plants. With time, she would like to acquire new fields to expand her crops. This is her fifth loan with MFP, and she has been very punctual with her payments. In her communal bank, she is a very responsible member. With the loan she is requesting, she will buy barbasco seeds, since she has 2 hectares of land where she can cultivate them.\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":750405,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

She is a very cheerful and hard-working woman, who lives in her own house together with her husband Fernando, age 29, and their 2 beloved children, Gabriel, age 8, and Pa\u00fal, age 3, for whom she wants to provide a better quality of life. Ylaria has spent the greater part of her life in her beloved village of Santa Rosa. Since she was a very young girl, she has learned how to farm; today she works on her own fields at her husband's side, where together they grow cacao, coffee and coca leaves. This work has provided the income necessary to cover the needs of her children. She sells everything she harvests to the wholesale centers located in the city of San Francisco, where she receives better prices for each of her products. What she likes most about her work is planting her fields, and she does this with great care. She has done this work for 9 years, and she thinks the most difficult part is transporting her products, since cargo vehicles are very scarce in this part of the rainforest zone of the Apurimac river valley. With time, she would like to buy new lands, with the aim of increasing her production.

She is married to Frank, 35, and they have three children. They live together in harmony in their own home. Olga and her husband are the pillars for their children, who from a very early age were taught how to tend the land. Olga is a farmer and has four hectares of land where she cultivates coffee and cocoa, plants that originated from the rain forest area in the Apurimac River Valley. She has been dedicated to this activity for the past 11 years, and at harvest time she counts on the support of hired laborers to harvest the crops and transport them to to be dried. What she likes most about her work is harvesting the plants since she can see her months of hard work be repaid with quality fruit. The task she considers to be the most difficult is transporting the products from her community to the commercial centers where she sells her items.

P. sells MicheTM fashion bags and accessories.  Her primary vending location is a kiosk at Lackland Air Force Base\u2019s exchange, but she also sells at Fort Sam Houston and various special events in and outside of San Antonio.   \r\n\r\nAnnette likes MicheTM bags because she believes they are unique, fun products.  MicheTM makes \u201cbase\u201d bags that people can buy and then customize with special \u201cshells\u201d (covers).  The shells can be changed off and on so that the same bag can have many different looks.  It\u2019s a creative way for fashion-conscious women to have the perfect-looking bag for any occasion.\r\n\r\nOriginally from New York, Annette settled in San Antonio after serving in the military.  When she first started her business, she was working full-time with Travelocity.  She would work nights at Travelocity, and then go work all day at the kiosk.  Now she devotes all of her time to her business, which allows her to attend and sell at more events.  Last summer, Annette was invited by the Army Air Force Exchange Services to sell bags at military bases in Arizona and New Mexico.  Despite the fact that she had to drive so that she could bring enough inventory, the events were very profitable for her and are something she wants to continue in the future.\r\n\r\nAnnette is using this loan to increase her inventory.  Because MicheTM frequently updates its product line, she has to have the latest styles so that she can maintain her client base.  By the end of the year, she hopes to buy a van so that she can have more inventory with her when she sells at out-of-state military bases and events.\r\n\r\nAnnette says she has definitely lost personal time since starting her business.  However, she says it works for her family because her husband is supportive of her and her business, and helps out a lot at home.  Annette\u2019s advice to other aspiring entrepreneurs is to not be afraid.  \u201cI\u2019m not really a salesperson, I\u2019m kind of shy, so it was hard for me to sell something.  I\u2019ve learned that if you just talk to people, you find out what they like, and it is easier to sell things to them.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1763.62,"image":{"id":750473,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy new inventory for the spring season.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"US","country":"United States","town":"San Antonio, Texas","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39.76 -98.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":173,"posted_date":"2011-04-13T19:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Annette","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2145,"loan_amount":2150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":153.03},{"due_date":"2011-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":168.22},{"due_date":"2011-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":171.49},{"due_date":"2011-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":173.13},{"due_date":"2011-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":175.62},{"due_date":"2011-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":178.77},{"due_date":"2011-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":180.74},{"due_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":183.79},{"due_date":"2012-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":186.02},{"due_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":188.71},{"due_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":191.79},{"due_date":"2012-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":193.69}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":153.39},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.61},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":171.89},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":173.53},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":176.03},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":179.19},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":181.16},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":184.22},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":186.45},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":189.15},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.24},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":194.14}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":153.39,"local_amount":153.03,"processed_date":"2011-05-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:19:45Z","rounded_local_amount":153.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211145781,"comment":null},{"amount":168.61,"local_amount":168.22,"processed_date":"2011-06-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:23:50Z","rounded_local_amount":168.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216431410,"comment":null},{"amount":171.89,"local_amount":171.49,"processed_date":"2011-07-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:01:11Z","rounded_local_amount":171.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221596333,"comment":null},{"amount":173.53,"local_amount":173.13,"processed_date":"2011-08-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-29T07:41:11Z","rounded_local_amount":173.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":226966209,"comment":null},{"amount":176.03,"local_amount":175.62,"processed_date":"2011-09-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-28T07:40:10Z","rounded_local_amount":176.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232725046,"comment":null},{"amount":179.19,"local_amount":178.77,"processed_date":"2011-10-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-23T08:44:20Z","rounded_local_amount":179.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238529094,"comment":null},{"amount":181.16,"local_amount":180.74,"processed_date":"2011-11-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-30T08:35:50Z","rounded_local_amount":181.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244488925,"comment":null},{"amount":184.22,"local_amount":183.79,"processed_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:03:28Z","rounded_local_amount":184.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250697287,"comment":null},{"amount":186.45,"local_amount":186.02,"processed_date":"2012-01-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:11:45Z","rounded_local_amount":186.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257101339,"comment":null},{"amount":189.15,"local_amount":188.71,"processed_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:08:36Z","rounded_local_amount":189.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263226448,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-04-16T02:44:18Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":290230,"name":"Cristo Resucitado Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El grupo se llama CRISTO RESUCITADO el cual esta ubicado en el estado de Puebla, Mexico.

He lives with his wife Jenny, age 28, and their two children Javier and Ruth (ages 5 and 2 respectively).  They have their own home where they live in harmony.  Joel works on his land where he grows cacao, coffee, <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Lonchocarpus_urucu\" target=\"_blank\" >barbasco<\/a>, and pineapple.  He has a total of three hectares of land on which he cultivates his crops.  His parents taught him how to farm and now he has his own land that he bought with the savings he accumulated.  Joel knows how to hard.  He has been farming for nine years and has the help of workers during the harvest season who are in charge of collecting the produce so that it can be sold later.  Joel is very committed to his work and today he gets to enjoy the fruits of his labor.  Although he generates good earnings, he is not pleased with the winter season because of the large population of insects that are present during these months that could harm his crops.  The loan he is requesting will be used to buy pineapple seedlings to plant in place of coffee since these fruits generate more income in less time.  For now, his greatest priority is to acquire additional farmland so that he can expand his production.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis is his fifth loan with MFP.  Joel knows that if he submits his payments on time, he will be able to access more loans from his Communal Bank with greater ease and few complications.

Her father was a fisherman and her mother sold fish.\r\n\r\nEach time the river rose they had to leave their home because it would end up under water.  Back then there was still no retaining wall.  Isabel could only study up to her third year of secondary education because when she was 15 her father abandoned the family and, as the eldest daughter, she had to work to help her mom raise her siblings.\r\n\r\nMaria Isabel started working as a cleaner.  At the age of 19 she had her first child and had to go and work on a farm stay as a cook in order to be able to raise her child.\r\n\r\nIsabel currently lives in San Francisco neighborhood, in the city of Concepci\u00f3n with her partner, 32 year-old Carlos Alberto, who works as an assistant chainsaw operator.  They have two children: 15 year-old Daysi and 8 year-old Jos\u00e9 Miguel.

Sonia and her partner are the mainstay of their family. From very early on in her childhood Sonia's parents instilled in her the value of working the fields. She has her own plot where she has been growing coffee plants and coca leaves. She has been working her own land for ten years. During harvest season she hires day laborers to extract the beans and thus proceeds more quickly with the harvest. \r\n\r\nThe thing she enjoys most about her work is collecting the beans from the plants as she feels then that the months of arduous work are rewarded by the quality of the beans. She believes that the most difficult aspect is transporting her products from the field to the collection centers located in the city of San Francisco [Peru], a place where better prices are to be had for her beans and coca leaves. The difficulty she has is not having enough income to cover advance payments to the workers who help her with the harvesting. Thus she turns to loans provided by the institution MFP.

This is a very densely-populated, poor, urban area of the city.  It is known as 'the prison sector' because Portoviejo women's prison is located in this area.\r\n\r\nHere we meet 20 year-old Jennifer who is single and lives in her parents' home.  She is studying her fifth semester of a psychology degree at Manab\u00ed Technical University.  This is her second loan cycle with her community bank and she likes it because, through the loans, she has managed to get ahead in her business and help herself in her studies.\r\n\r\nAs well as being a very good student, Jennifer also makes party supplies, such as decorations and appliqu\u00e9s, from Styrofoam.  Sometimes her customers also ask her for educational games for their little ones.  Jennifer works three days a week and sometimes four when she has a lot of work.  She tells us that she has been in this business for two years and it has done very well.

B. is a 30-year-old, married woman from the village of Balbagon, Mambajao, Camiguin Province. She and her husband have two school-age children. To earn a living, Loni owns and operates a business venture in the food sector. Specifically, she operates a small restaurant. Her primary source of income is derived from serving a variety of different traditional Filipino meals (such as afritada, caldereta, and bulalo) to customers in her local community. Loni has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP per month from these activities. <p>\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Loni joined HSPFI to gain much-needed access to financial services. As a result, she is better able to engage in business activities and to thereby improve her family's standard of living. Recently, Loni successfully repaid a previous loan in the amount of 13,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase food and drinks for the restaurant. Loni is now requesting another loan, this time in the amount of 14,000 PHP ($325), which will be used to purchase additional ingredients like vegetables, spices, and meats. Notably, this loan would be the fifth loan taken out by Loni from HSPFI.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<p>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<p>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Narzullo is an active 47-year-old father. His wife is a housewife. He is a farmer and also, he is engaged in animal husbandry. The income he earns from this business allows him to take care of his family of two children and his wife. \r\n\r\nNarzullo would like to increase his harvest in order to maximize his income, and to do so he needs to buy fertilizer, seeds.

As he lacks the financial means to do all this, Narzullo is requesting a loan of 9000 Somoni to help him buy cattle, fertilizer and seeds.\r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This school was founded by the Roman Catholic Mission in 1954 to promote education. Over the years, the school has produced a great number of lecturers, teachers, and other professionals in different walks of life. Currently, the school has 18 staff members and 637 pupils.  \r\n\r\nThis is the first loan that RC Junior Secondary School from Kabala is accessing from Kiva through SMT. School staff from this institution, like many other schools' staff within SMT\u2019s operational areas, come to SMT to apply for loans. With the help of these loans, they can accomplish certain tasks that they would otherwise not be able to accomplish with their salaries alone. But with the help of this loan, some can pay school fees for their children; others can use the loan to buy furniture, a plot of land, house-building materials, or invest in business. At the end of each month, these teachers can repay the loan out of their monthly salaries. The institution\u2019s bursar is directly responsible for deducting the repayment and pays SMT on their behalf.\r\n\r\nSixty-seven-year-old Andrew A.Y. M. is the leader of this group of teachers and has been a teacher himself for 41 years. He was born in Kabala township and is married with four children: one in secondary school, two in college and one no longer attending school. Andrew will use his loan to pay his children's college fees. \r\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":4475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":761446,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","use":"To pay his children's college fees ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Kabala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"9.583333 -11.55","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":4475,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Andrew A.y.","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anna A.

C. lives in Samtredia District, in the village of Dabla Gomi. She is 56 years old and lives with her husband, two sons, and her daughter-in-law. A couple of weeks ago, she became a grandmother and now they have an infant boy in the home. \r\n\r\nEleonora\u2019s sons are in military service. Eleonora and her husband are heading the family agricultural business: a small dairy farm, which consists of four milk cows. The end-product \u2013 20 kg of traditional Georgian cheese is sold on the market. They also have a plot of the land where maize is grown. From the harvested 6 tons of maize only 600 kg is sold and the rest is used in the farm. Also the family owns a lemon garden, which gives them 500 kg of lemon per year. These are sold locally. Along the above-mentioned, Eleonora had 30 bee-hives with bee colonies. 24 colonies were destroyed because of unfavorable weather conditions last year. Now only six bee colonies are left.\r\n\r\nThe requested credit will be used for further development of their farm, in particular \u2013 50% of the credit will be used for purchasing 10 new bee colonies.

Su mayor desafio ha sido el arrendamiento de un carro de perros que sea muy funcional porque el que maneja en la actualidad tiene un solo freidor y una plancha, el cual  le ofrece muy poco espacio de trabajo, de todas maneras dia a dia se esfuerza para aumentar su utilidad que es no menor del 55% y su credikiva comprar\u00e0 su carro de perros.\n\n","en":"Victor Manuel is a young man who is 22 years old and since he was very young he looked for a way to generate an income by carrying out academic work. At the age of 12 years old, motivated by an enterprising spirit and independence, he started to work as an assistant in a neighborhood bakery. And when the owner opened another business selling fast foods he set out to learn the business. The following year, at the age of 13, he knew how to prepare foods and slowly he began to make a business of his own once he finally was able to purchase tools for his work. Even though he still does not have a cart of his own he has a personal goal of purchasing one. He really needs one especially because the one he uses is rented. This is the reason why he has approached Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo (Kiva Field Partner) to apply for his first Kiva loan, through which he will reach his goal. His dream is to complete his university studies in Physics; he is already on his sixth semester. His greatest challenge has been to rent a food cart that is highly functional because the one he currently rents only has one fryer and one skillet, giving him very little space to work. But despite this he works day after day to increase his profits. They never fall below 55%. And his Kiva loan will be used to purchase a food cart."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":396.56,"image":{"id":749184,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"to

M. and lives in a small city in Pakistan called Chichawatni. She resides in a three-room brick house with her husband and four children: two boys and two girls. Three of them are enrolled in a local school while youngest one has not started attending school yet.  Talat is a working woman as well as a housewife. She manages her household responsibilities and takes care of her children. She also sells embroidered clothes to her neighborhood clients. She purchases them from a city called Multan. The earned profits help her pay school fees for her children and utilities expenses.\r\n \r\nHer husband is a fruit vendor who operates a shop in the market. He believes in quality and provides fresh seasonal fruits for his clients to purchase.Talat has applied for a loan from Kiva partner Asasah for her husband, who will invest that money in his business.
