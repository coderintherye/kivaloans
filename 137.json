She treks to farming communities to buy her stock of tomatoes, pepper and fish from the farmers and fishmongers. This saves her from middlemen who buy from the farmers and resell to her at higher prices. With this loan, she wants to buy fresh tomatoes, pepper and dried fish in bulk to serve her customers.

She is 42 years old, divorced, and the mother of 3 children with ages between 15 and 21.  She only supports her children.\r\n\r\nLaurinda studied until the 2nd grade and stopped for a lack of financial conditions.  She was raised by her mother who was separated, along with 12 siblings.  When she was 18 years old she had her first child, and at 20 she was married.  She separated in 1993 3 years after moving from the Manhi\u00e7a district to the city of Maputo.  Before moving she was already in business selling coal, but she moved on to sell eggs and later began to sell grains and cereals which she continues to sell today.\r\n\r\nLaurinda lives basically selling grains and legumes.  She does not have any employees except for contracting temporarily for shipments.  The principal foods that she sells are corn, beans, and peanuts.  She acquires a can of peanuts for 200MT and sells it for 450MT. She has had a monthly income of between 18,000MT to 20,000MT.  She does not make periodic bank savings, only a common saving called Xitique that consists of a payment of all against all, being one each time.\r\n\r\nLaurinda intends to use this loan to increase the volume of her business.  She has future plans to construct some rooms once she has a big enough yard.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Jared Wandry, Kiva

She stared with a loan of $500.00 USD, but she is currently requesting a 7,000.00 BOB loan in order to increase her work capital and purchase the products and supplies she needs for her bakery. She is a very dynamic customer who, until recently, had a contract with Colegio Loretto school in the city of La Paz to make and sell breakfast in this educational center. She concurrently delivers her baked goods throughout different institutions and offices in the southern area of the city. She has two children who collaborate with her and who are now professionals. Her husband works for an electric company, so he is constantly traveling.

The members found food sales to be very lucrative. They were previously involved in another type of business, but it did not turn out to be as lucrative as expected. Alejandrina owns a stand on 6 de marzo Avenue (near Senkata) in which she sells candy, soft drinks, empanadas, and more. Marisol owns a stand in which she prepares and sells fast food, such as salichipapas (street food that consists of fries and sausages), fried chicken, hamburgers, tucumanas (fried pastry stuffed with meat and vegetables), and stuffed mashed potatoes. Guadalupe makes traditional llauchas (oven-baked cheese empanadas), which she sells on the city streets.

They will use the loan which they obtain for different purposes. Mr. Hun T. is the village bank president and a farmer who owns two-hectare to cultivate rice. Aside from this, he is a construction worker who can make a small income to support his household. His wife, Mrs. On Nam, helps him on the plantation. On this plantation, they face a problem because their field is infertile which affects their crops. To solve this problem, Mr. Hun T. decided to ask for a loan to buy fertilizer to support the field in order to make their crops more productive. Mr. Hun T. is 53 years old and the father of a child who is attending the local school. Two men among the three have come to get a loan instead of their wives because they are busy with their work. \r\n<p>\r\nThis is a village bank loan consisting of mainly end-of-term loans. Five members have end-of-term loans, and the rest have monthly payment loans. Group members are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK's main product because they are the most beneficial to Cambodia's poor. The EoT loans allow them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK's clients make their payments on time.

Since this business is going well, she wants to expand it, S. she decided to ask for a loan to buy two more pigs for breeding. Her husband, Mr. Thon Thuren, is a construction worker who can make a small income to support his family. Mrs. Prak S. A. is 50 years old and the mother of two children, one of whom sells firewood and another, the youngest, attends the local school. Mrs. Hem Chantha is a group guarantor and is alS. presented in the picture. All of the members are shown in the picture but two of them are blocked.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is a village bank loan consisting of mainly end-of-term loans. Seventeen members have end-of-term loans and the rest have monthly payment loans. Group members are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK's main product because they are the most beneficial to Cambodia's poor. The EoT loans allow them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able.

Muhabat works in a sphere of trade where the demand is always very consistent and high, because the national dresses in Tajikistan are very popular and a very important item in the dowry of any girl. She is one of the leading fabrics vendors in the market where she works. She is very perseverant and determined in all of her business endeavors, which has helped to sustain her venture for 17 years. Muhabat has about $3,500 in inventory at the moment. \r\n<p>\r\nMuhabat is a skilled entrepreneur. When she started this trade, she decided to implement basic concepts of integrity and hard work in her business to reach ultimate success. This laid a firm foundation for winning results and Muhabat has obviously been a successful small entrepreneur. However, she doesn\u2019t want to stop.

She is 48 years old, divorced, and the mother of 5 children.  The oldest is 25 years old, and the youngest is 11 years old.  She only supports her family.  Laura did not have the oppurtunity to go to school due to the war of colonial liberation, and her family did not have the conditions to pay for enrollment in other zones.\r\n\r\nShe passed her youth until her marriage when she moved to the city of Maputo with her husbands' company in 1988 to the Airport District B where she lives today, and from there her husband abandoned her.  As such she found herself obliged to search out alternatives to support her children and she decided to sell products of primary necessity.\r\n\r\nLaura lives basically through the business where she works every day from 6:00am to 6:00pm.  Her stand out products are salt and cabbage.  She acquires the salt for 140MT per 50kg sack, and she sells it for 250MT.  She has a daily income of 400MT and saves 3,000MT monthly.  This is her first loan through Hluvuku and Kiva, and she never solicited other institutions.  She came to know Hluvuku through some friends who were already clients.  Her big dream is to have one more stand to increase her profits.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Jared Wandry, Kiva

M. lives in the Spitamen region of Tajikistan, and she is a schoolteacher by professional background. She is married, and she has one child. She first applied to MicroInvest for a loan earlier in 2008, when she heard about MicroInvest and the way in which its loans are disbursed. Thanks to the previous loan she secured and successfully repaid, she was able to improve her family's living conditions. <p>\r\nUnfortunately, it is difficult to get by on a schoolteacher's salary alone, so Khalimahon is also engaged in the livestock business. Indeed, she has a good flock of animals, and she takes care of her animals so that she can sell milk products from such animals at the local bazaar on weekends.

Saidamir is married with two children. He is 32 years old and lives in Dushanbe, Tajikistan. Saidamir is an animated man full of enthusiasm. He works hard preparing and selling oil in his house.

Initially he had only one oil-press. He expanded his business and now has two oil-presses. Her wife and his brother help him with the business.

She's the mother of three children, ages 18, 15 and 10, all enrolled in school.\r\n\r\nHer studies were interrupted in 11th grade, when she got pregnant with her first child. She and her partner have been together since 1989 and own their own house. She's learned how to run a business with her grandmother, who used to sell shellfish at one of the markets on the outskirts of Maputo.\r\n\r\nSandra helps support her family, and her mother, by selling basic food products from home, an activity that gives her a monthly net income of about 28.000,00 MT and allows her to  save some money. The bulk of her profit comes from selling peanuts, which she buys bulk for 1.950,00 MT a bag, and resells for 2,500,00 MT.

She's 43 years old, married, and mother to six children.  The eldest is 26, and the two youngest ones are 13-year-old twins.  All are still students.  Besides her family, she helps her mother, sending money to the town of Pemba.\r\n\r\nPaulina studied until 7th grade in the old national system of education.  She stopped her studies due to health problems and financial difficulty in paying the fees.  Paulina left Cabo Delgado, accompanied by her husband, who was transferred by his work, and they have been here until today.\r\n\r\nPaulina works at selling clothes, a business that she learned from her sisters ever since she was little.  Her best product is clothing made out of African wax print cloth, sold for 125 meticais per blouse and 950 meticais for a suit.  She has a monthly income of 5000 meticais and saves 2000 of it.\r\n\r\nFor Paulina, this is her first loan from Hluvuku and Kiva.  She has never solicited a loan from other institutions.  She heard of Hluvuku through friends who are clients.  She plans with this loan to increase her amount of stock and supply more products for her clients.

For more than 10 years she has been selling children's clothing. Firengiz is a very enthusiastic and dynamic woman. She has very good taste in selecting the clothing that she buys and amazing marketing skills in convincing her clients about the clothing they should buy. She has been the main breadwinner of the family for a long time. She now requests a loan which she will use to buy new clothing for the autumn season and to purchase some women's clothes. Firengiz is grateful for your generosity and help."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":211456,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To buy

age 37, is married and has four children. As a young woman M. was treated badly by a relative with whom she was living, and so M. resorted to getting married early to relieve the stress on her. She is a very hard-working woman who produced and sold products, but she encountered a break down when her goods were destroyed inside a transport vehicle that was carrying animals. This caused her to become short on market capital.\r\n\r\nIt was under this stress that a friend introduced her to GHAPE, from which she took a loan and was able to pay it back.

She is a fish seller who earns a small income to support her family. Her husband, Mr. Bo Beang, and one of their children, are fishermen, while their other child is a pig breeder. Although Mrs. Phon M.'s family members work in different businesses, they still cannot afford to pay for electricity in their house. Mrs. Phon M. is asking for a loan to buy three batteries for a lamp to light the house to improve her family's living conditions. \r\n<p>\r\nAll the members in the group have end-of-term loans and they are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK's main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia's poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK's clients make their payments on time.
