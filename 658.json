She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products through the popular direct selling brands like Avon, Fuller life and other direct selling brands. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealer\u2019s prices are lower than those in the catalogue, and these are the profits that dealers are investing on as their income. Aside from this she is also selling silver and beads accessories. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 4,500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, she is requesting a 35,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy merchandise items and products needed in her business. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nYvonne dreams to expand her business and hopes to have an apartment unit some day. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance

is Rhea, 28, a resident of Quezon City, Philippines. She is married to Christopher, her business partner, and a mother to her children. She, together with her husband and children, manage their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nRhea operates a tailoring business. She mainly offers curtains, bed sheets, blankets, and other home trappings. Seasonal demands for clothing like uniforms and such are available all year round. She also does repairs and alterations. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 800 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy more quantities of raw materials like fabric, thread and newspapers for patterns. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nRhea hopes to be able to expand soon and dreams of being able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work in her business.

International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for everyday expenses.  \n\nLiza operates a laundry soap retailing business.

She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities and varieties of products to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \n\nLiza dreams of being able to give all her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\n\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n","en":"Muslihitdin is a hard-working and conscientious person.

Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Aykaz's sons live together with their families separately from the parents.  Aykaz finished a Sevan professional technical college.  He spent twenty years working as a mechanic in the agricultural collective and then started his own farm in 1993.  Aykaz's wife helps him, and thanks to their joint efforts, they breed cows, sheep, pigs and chickens.  Aykaz also owns a small plot of land, where he grows feed for his domestic animals and buys the remaining feed from his neighbors.  He sells his agricultural products (milk products, beef, lamb, pork, eggs and poultry) at the Razdanskiy city market and uses resulting profits to support his family.  Aykaz needs a loan in the sum of 500,000 dram for the purchase needed animal feed and to repair his lawn mower.  He and his wife intend to use the obtained income to finish the construction of their

They all come from the community of San Bernardo in the city of Santiago.\r\n\r\nNelly is the president of the Communal Bank, who is seated in the front row of the photo.  She is the second from the right, and she is wearing a black jacket.  Her hair is short and blonde.  She has been working selling second-hand clothes for the last 15 years, at a stand located in the open markets.  Her work schedule is mornings twice a week, and also the weekends.  She has many customers, some of whom she has kept since the beginning.  \r\n\r\nShe now wants to start moving into selling new clothes.  With the loan, she will buy new clothes.  Her goals are to have a permanent location in the bazaar, and in this way to prosper with her business.\r\n\r\nNelly lives with her husband and her four children aged 30, 29, 17 and 13, plus a 7-year-old granddaughter.  Her dreams are to provide her children and granddaughter with a quality education, so that they may have a better quality of life.  Her motivation is to continue with her business, as it is through her work that she is able to make a financial contribution to her household. \r\n\r\nNelly is very happy and grateful for the loans and the services offered through Fondo Esperanza.  In addition, she feels very comfortable with her group at the Communal Bank, as she has known them for several years and has neighbors among them.  These meetings have allowed her to achieve self-fulfillment.  In regards to the training, it's helped her to specialize and to manage her business better.\r\n\r\nSan Bernardo is a city located 18km due south of the Plaza de Armas of Santiago (the capital of Chile).  It is well known as the capital of folklore, thanks to the fact that in January of each year, they have the \"International Festival of Folklore\".  This is an event where the roots of the country come together and meet with musical groups from throughout South America.  They also host the \"Festival of Traditional Handicrafts\", in which many Chilean artesans participate, as well as those from other nearby countries.  Later in April, there is \"April of a Thousand Cuecas\", which consists of cueca dancing (a traditional Chilean dance) for the whole community."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3700,"image":{"id":855188,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to

Her husband makes and sells Chilean flags for the patriotic holiday season.\r\n\r\nHer goals for her business are to have a larger cart which would allow her to stock more merchandise for her business.\r\n\r\nXimena lives with her husband and her three sons aged 20, 15, 12, and 3.  Her dream on a personal level is to buy her own home.  She is already putting together the documentation, as she wants to buy the house in which she and her family are currently living.  Another of her dreams is to pay for higher education for her children, so that they may become professionals.\r\n\r\nXimena is very happy and grateful for the loans from Fondo Esperanze, as they have allowed her to invest in her business.  In regards to the trainings held at the Communal Bank meetings, she has been able to put these into place in her business.  Additionally, she also participates in several workshops for micro-entrepreneurship.\r\n\r\nEstaci\u00f3n Central is a community located in a central area of Santiage (the capital of Chile).  The community takes its name from the Central Railway Station, which dates back to 1887 and was declared a National Monument in 1983.  In its early days, this station, together with the Mapocho station, was the entrance to the capital for the Valpara\u00edso -  Santiago route, and also routes from the southern part of the country."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":855361,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy candy, and also invest in small Chilean flags for decorating cars during the patriotic holidays.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CL","country":"Chile","town":"Estaci\u00f3n Central","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-30 -71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":157,"posted_date":"2011-08-26T19:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ximena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CLP","disbursal_amount":400802,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":21238},{"due_date":"2011-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":24147},{"due_date":"2011-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":23859},{"due_date":"2011-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":24087},{"due_date":"2011-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":24317},{"due_date":"2011-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":24163},{"due_date":"2011-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":25134},{"due_date":"2011-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":25020},{"due_date":"2011-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":24974},{"due_date":"2011-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":25749},{"due_date":"2011-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":25744},{"due_date":"2011-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":25628},{"due_date":"2011-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":26526},{"due_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":26488},{"due_date":"2011-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":26741},{"due_date":"2011-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":26987}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.37},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.71},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.09},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.58},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.09},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.75},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.87},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.62},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.52},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.22},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.2},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.95},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.91},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.83},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.37},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":151.17,"local_amount":69244,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T09:05:33Z","rounded_local_amount":70965.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227035330,"comment":null},{"amount":213.29,"local_amount":97701,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:00:18Z","rounded_local_amount":100130.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232795988,"comment":null},{"amount":221.56,"local_amount":101487,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:11:45Z","rounded_local_amount":104010.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238606909,"comment":null},{"amount":288.98,"local_amount":132370,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:50:33Z","rounded_local_amount":135661.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244561277,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-08-27T07:59:55Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T09:50:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":329858,"name":"Angelica","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Husband and wife entrepreneurs Angelica and Roman started Colmex Construction, LLC in June 2008.

Last year Sheree was laid off from being a long-time executive assistant for a community bank, but it allowed her the time to be a full-time caregiver for her ill mother who later passed away in April 2011. It was during this time of reflection that she sought divine revelation for the next steps of her life and as a result the idea for Virtuous Executive Services, LLC (VES) was born. \n\nSheree's experiences as a legislative assistant to over 32 state representatives in the Louisiana Legislative Black Caucus, Tulane University Medical School and College, and formerly Dryades Savings Bank, now First NBC Bank provided a firm foundation for her new business venture. Now, Sheree is using her 26 years of executive-level administrative skills to win contracts to provide other executives with high quality administrative and back office support services. \n\nSheree will use the Kiva loan to pay for marketing expenses and operational expenses, such as office supplies and equipment and payroll. As a working mother, Sheree ultimately wants to demonstrate to her two young daughters that they, too, can succeed as business owners.

Esailama explains that their mom and pop company is a perfect marriage of her business administration background and her husband\u2019s entrepreneurial skill (he has had a successful line of oils, incense, and shampoos as an herbalist for over a decade). Camara introduced Esailama, a dancer, and Tyrone, a drummer, and was a mainstay in their lives and the New Orleans cultural community for many years. Camara was stranded for many days after Katrina and died from complications caused by cancer not long after being evacuated and returning to his native Senegal. The couple sees their company as part of a cultural and vocational heritage he bequeathed to them. Six years after Katrina, some of Tyrone\u2019s family are still displaced. Esailama explains that the company melds together family traditions and culture, and their product includes spices that have been passed down in the family for many generations.  \r\n\r\n\u201cBissap\u201d is a West African word for \u201chibiscus.\u201d In many cultures globally, the hibiscus is valued for its medicinal properties. High in antioxidants and vitamin C, the Bissap Breeze product can be used as a tea, in cooking, or as a cocktail mix. The company launched its first product sales of Bissap Breeze at the French Market during Jazz Fest weekend earlier this year, and the company has rapidly expanded. A portion of the proceeds from the sale of each bottle are used to support the performing arts and ensure that the cultural legacy of dance and music live on in New Orleans.  \r\n\r\nThis Kiva loan will be used to purchase organic agave, the most expensive ingredient in the product, as well as for marketing expenses and working capital.  \u201cWe\u2019re not just out to make a product,\u201d

is 51 years of age, married, and is blessed with nine children. Most of his children are sent to college. His wife is a teacher and works also as a housekeeper.\r\n\r\nManaging a large crop of rice is the main source of income for Hilary. Through profits in farming, he helped his wife provide for their children's school fees.

Her good, kind service is one of the factors that makes her store one of the most popular in the area, with some of the highest sales.

His wife is a homemaker, son attends the Kapan polytechnical institute, and daughter goes to the Kadjaran secondary school.  Davit works as a driver at the Zangezursk copper-molybdenum factory.  Parallel to his factory work, Davit is involved in agriculture at the Tandzaver village.  Davit breeds cattle, bees, and also grows vegetables and fruits on his farm.  He sells his agricultural products, such as vegetables, fruits, beef, milk and honey, in the cities of Kapan and Kadjaran.  Davit likes to work on his farm very much and receives an enormous satisfaction from the fact that his family gets natural products straight from his farm.  Davit needs a loan in the sum of 1,000,000 dram in order to purchase five bulls, new beehives, frames for honey and hay for the winter, so that he would be able to gather more agricultural products in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":448.27,"image":{"id":855691,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

She is married to Reynaldo, a stockman, and they have three children. Beverly and her husband manage their own household while operating the business. Beverly works hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nBeverly operates a variety store which, in the Philippines, is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, PHP 5 worth of cooking oil or an egg. Beverly earns an income by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house and her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 300 PHP in daily sales.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, Beverly is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan, which she will use to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nBeverly hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she dreams of being able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work in her business.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a 5-pesos worth of cooking oil or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 450 Philippine Pesos (Php) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 33,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nImelda hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she dreams to be able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work in her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Having started her agricultural business over ten years ago with practically nothing, Rahimakhon achieved good results.  Today, she has eight heads of sheep and cultivated land with potatoes, corn and sunflowers in her household.  Her monthly income from the sale of these products amounts to an average of 6,000 som (KGS), which provides a good support for the family, where the husband receives only a disability pension.  Rahimakhon went to the \"Bai Tushum and Partners\" to obtain a loan in the sum of 80,000 som for the purchase of livestock.
