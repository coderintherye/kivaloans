They plan to buy merchandise for their businesses or to fix up their homes with the money. Griselda, the newest member, is a part-time university student who studies psychology and needs the loan to help finance her education.\r\n\r\nDavid is the current president of Kantu San Jer\u00f3nimo. He has three children and runs a metal carpentry shop for producing things such as furniture, doors, stairwells, and window frames. He wants to purchase new machinery for his store with this loan.\r\n\r\nThe group met at Arariwa headquarters in Cusco to discuss the terms and conditions of their loan. They are committed to paying it back on time and are grateful to have access to the capital needed to run their businesses.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3825,"image":{"id":339071,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":708,"youtube_id":"TlzTdOCU3v0"},"activity":"Metal Shop","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"to purchase new machinery for metal carpentry shop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"San Jeronimo - Cusco - Cusco","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":119,"posted_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3825,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"David Pasto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Susana Marlyn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yanet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Silvia Patricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Norma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sisinia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Leopoldo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maribel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatriz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alyde Marisol","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Griselda Hesperida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ruth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Javier Fausto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":11500,"loan_amount":3825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2708.13},{"due_date":"2009-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2816.46},{"due_date":"2009-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2929.13},{"due_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":3046.28}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":900.75},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":936.78},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":974.25},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1013.22}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":900.75,"local_amount":2708.13,"processed_date":"2009-07-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T11:24:52Z","rounded_local_amount":2724.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63139226,"comment":null},{"amount":938.67,"local_amount":2822.14,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T12:22:09Z","rounded_local_amount":2839.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73564845,"comment":null},{"amount":975.25,"local_amount":2932.11,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T13:07:44Z","rounded_local_amount":2950.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86998408,"comment":null},{"amount":1010.33,"local_amount":3037.62,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T14:47:59Z","rounded_local_amount":3056.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96910660,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-07-14T19:38:41Z","paid_date":"2009-11-15T14:47:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":116754,"name":"Fahed","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fahed is a young man who is married and has two children.

So, Kifah thought of creating this micro business.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe business is primarily managed by Kifah since her husband is employed elsewhere, but he helps her after finishing his work.

Gloria places orders with beer delivery trucks, then sells the beer from her home. She tries to keep well-stocked, since this beverage is in high demand and she earns good money selling it. Sometimes, though, she doesn't have enough money to buy large quantities of beer and runs out by the time the weekend comes. \r\n\r\nGloria hopes to continue to expand her business, since it makes her feel independent and helps her provide her family with a higher quality of life. She is a long-time client of Microfinanzas PRISMA, and has always shown herself to be dedicated and responsible to her village bank. Her fellow group members are also her friends. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Gloria will buy more beer so that her supply will last through the weekend. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Cynthia McMurry, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":339298,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Liquor Store \/ Off-License","sector":"Food","use":"Buy beer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-06-23T18:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gloria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":35,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:43:49Z","rounded_local_amount":105.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990788,"comment":null},{"amount":35,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:45:27Z","rounded_local_amount":105.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211920,"comment":null},{"amount":35,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-08-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:27:56Z","rounded_local_amount":105.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641448,"comment":null},{"amount":35,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:40:18Z","rounded_local_amount":105.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080887,"comment":null},{"amount":35,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-10-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:15:40Z","rounded_local_amount":105.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997028,"comment":null},{"amount":35,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-11-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:00Z","rounded_local_amount":105.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842367,"comment":null},{"amount":140,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-26T10:01:30Z","rounded_local_amount":423.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110733938,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

D. is from the town of Lingating, Baungon, Bukidnon. She is 51 years old. Anaceta is married and has four adult-aged children. To make a living, Anaceta owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector operating a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from engaging in the buying and selling of dried fish in their village. She peddles her product every day. During our visit to Anaceta, her dried fish was already sold out. Anaceta has been engaged in her business for over a year and earns approximately 3000 PHP a month for these activities. She is hoping for more improvement to her business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Anaceta joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Anaceta has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Anaceta is requesting a new loan of 8000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Anaceta from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement income of the family. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":339364,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish

C. is from the village of Buenavista, Oroquieta City, Misamis Occidental. She is 58 years old and single. To make a living, Tita owns and operates a business in the retail sector operating a \"sari-sari\" store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling daily use products such as soap, shampoo, toothpaste, etc. in the local community. Tita has been engaged in her business for over 16 years and earns approximately 2,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Tita joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Tita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,000 PHP from GDMPC. Tita is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Tita from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to save as a reserve for future emergencies. \r\n\r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is a 31-year-old married mother of two school-aged children. To make a living, Nancy owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector operating a clothing business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling of used clothing locally known as ukay-ukay. She delivers her ukay -ukay in nearby villages during market days. Nancy has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns ~3,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Nancy joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Nancy has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to invest in expanding the business. Nancy is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP to purchase additional items of clothing for the business. This will be her 2nd loan from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to support her children\u2019s education and put up a stall for her business in the village.\r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

K. was born in 1964 and is a mother blessed with three kids. She is a local crop cultivator, growing crops such as morning glories, cucumbers and cabbages. She takes 2 or 3 months' time to cultivate her crop and then sells them to the market sellers.

Together with her husband, she works to clear their school dues. She also helps to care for her aunt. \r\n<p>\r\nJackline has had a business selling second-hand clothes for eight years. Her main challenge is transporting her goods between various markets, which sometimes becomes too costly. Her main markets of business are Katerera, Kyendangara and Mugyera town markets, and these give her a monthly profit of 250,000 UGX. Jackline is successful because she deals in a variety of clothes, including womenswear, menswear and childrenswear. Her dream is to have a clothes store in Katerera town so that she can cease transporting her stock to markets. She also dreams of seeing all her children attain the best education and get good jobs.

She started her own clothing business sixteen years ago and has been building a successful enterprise. She has a good location in the market for her sales and creates an attractive display of clothing for passing customers. She is a married woman with two children. The income she is able to make is a help to her to support her children with a proper education.\r\n\r\nInoyatkhon has requested a loan of 12,000 Somoni so that she can purchase an inventory of new clothing. This loan will allow her to increase her income by having the right clothing available to meet seasonal demand. Over the last four years, She has proven to be a great loan client with IMON International. We are glad to have this new opportunity to continue assisting her with her business.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is very grateful to everyone who is helping him to achieve his dreams with this loan. \r\n\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

R. is from the village of Tagoloan, Misamis Oriental. She is 38 years old. Menelyn is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Menelyn owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector, operating a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling beverages, like soft drinks, in their village. Menelyn has been engaged in this business for over 4 years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2007, Menelyn joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Menelyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 11,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Menelyn is requesting a new loan of 13,000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the 4th loan taken out by Menelyn from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to support the education of the children and provide for the family's needs. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About HSPFI:<\/b><br>\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

When bought in bulk he purchases his merchandise cheaper, in order to make a larger profit on the sales.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":339622,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase of merchandise such as rice, sugar, flour, noodles, tea and candy","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PY","country":"Paraguay","town":"Villa Elisa","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-25.366667 -57.616667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":58,"posted_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:23Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luiz","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PYG","disbursal_amount":4000000,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":444444.44},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":444444.44},{"due_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":444444.44},{"due_date":"2009-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":444444.44},{"due_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":444444.44},{"due_date":"2009-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":444444.44},{"due_date":"2009-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":444444.44},{"due_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":444444.44},{"due_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":444444.48}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.89},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.89},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.89},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.89},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.89},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.89},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.89},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.89},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.88}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":177.78,"local_amount":888888.88,"processed_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-22T09:21:06Z","rounded_local_amount":894222.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63177502,"comment":null},{"amount":88.89,"local_amount":444444.44,"processed_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T15:52:01Z","rounded_local_amount":447111.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73602886,"comment":null},{"amount":88.89,"local_amount":444444.44,"processed_date":"2009-09-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-17T09:30:42Z","rounded_local_amount":447111.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87038967,"comment":null},{"amount":88.89,"local_amount":444444.44,"processed_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T22:06:14Z","rounded_local_amount":447111.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96951414,"comment":null},{"amount":88.89,"local_amount":444444.44,"processed_date":"2009-11-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:39:21Z","rounded_local_amount":447111.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103793513,"comment":null},{"amount":88.89,"local_amount":444444.44,"processed_date":"2009-12-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:46:41Z","rounded_local_amount":447111.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110684282,"comment":null},{"amount":88.89,"local_amount":444444.44,"processed_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-19T08:44:55Z","rounded_local_amount":447111.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118078893,"comment":null},{"amount":88.88,"local_amount":444444.48,"processed_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:11:38Z","rounded_local_amount":447111.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123915070,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-07-21T01:40:43Z","paid_date":"2010-03-15T10:11:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":116933,"name":"3 De Junio Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This committee formed with the reunion of various neighbors in the city of Villa Elisa.

Val\u00e9rie was born on April 28, 1975 in Cotonou, the administrative and political capital of the Republic of Benin.  She is married to ZOHOUN Archille, a building technician, and is the mother of four children, of whom two are twins.  Val\u00e9rie attended school through the 5th grade, that is, through primary school.  Then she learned how to sew and did so for two years.  She dropped sewing because it did not allow her to support herself. \r\n\r\nCurrently, Val\u00e9rie sells second-hand clothing door-to-door.  She has already benefited from two loans with Alid\u00e9 and has repaid them.  Val\u00e9rie needs funding to augment her working capital in order to produce more income for supporting herself.  This is why she\u2019s requesting a third loan from Alid\u00e9.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva

The last loan she had was used to buy ten trays of eggs, as well as spices to sell in order to grow her revenues.  \r\n\r\nKilolo is divorced and is the mother of four children, ranging in age from 6 to 17.  Three of them are students.  One is in secondary school, and two are in primary school.  Currently, her capital amounts to $100.  Her business generates for her a profit of $48 each week.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva

Then, she learned how to sew, something she has been working at for a few years. \r\n\r\nAlong with sewing, Victorine has been selling various items: candies, cookies, canned foods (milk, sardine, tomatoes), sugar, pasta, soaps for the laundry, dishes, and bath, batteries, candles, etc., and this business has in the end supplanted her sewing.  She has already benefited from four loans with Alid\u00e9 and has repaid them.  She needs funding to diversify her business by selling pub products and fruit juices.  She is therefore requesting a fifth loan from Alid\u00e9 to buy a refrigerator. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":339767,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","use":"To buy a refrigerator ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Cotonou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.35 2.433333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2009-06-23T20:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Victorine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":200000,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2009-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2009-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2010-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2010-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T10:26:21Z","rounded_local_amount":20043.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63126483,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T10:52:22Z","rounded_local_amount":20043.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73549909,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T11:13:58Z","rounded_local_amount":20043.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86983700,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T12:07:48Z","rounded_local_amount":20043.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96896069,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T11:09:21Z","rounded_local_amount":20043.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103735649,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T11:28:08Z","rounded_local_amount":20043.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110623160,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T10:13:49Z","rounded_local_amount":20043.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118019865,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T08:21:19Z","rounded_local_amount":20043.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123858359,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-27T23:22:13Z","rounded_local_amount":20043.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":130494859,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:40:08Z","rounded_local_amount":20042.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144652604,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-06-24T18:20:25Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T08:40:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":117000,"name":"Victoria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Victoria D. is forty-five years old.

is 38 years old, married, and the father of one child who is currently in school.

Carpentry has been his major occupation and the main source of livelihood for his upkeep. He owns a carpentry shop where he manufactures all kinds of things pertaining to furniture work. He manufactures things like chairs, wardrobes, beds etc. He says that, for lack of adequate working capital, he is not able to pre-finance most of the orders from his customers.

His wife left him and he was forced to find ways to feed his growing boys. This is how he ended up being a small entrepreneur from Belaya Tserkov working in the sphere of recycling services. Vasyl owns two small market stalls at different marketplaces in his home town of Belaya Tserkov. He has two hired employees who help him run his small venture. People bring empty glass bottles that are to be recycled to Vasyl. He collects them in plastic boxes and takes them to a recycling company. Vasyl has been in this business for eight years so far. Presently, he gets about 19,000 Grivnyas in income each month. \r\n\r\nVasyl is seeking a 5,500 Grivnya loan to re-construct and equip his garage with necessary units for glass bottle storage. Moreover, he would like to re-construct it so that he could keep his car there as well. Vasyl believes he could use his spacious garage facility much more efficiently if he reorganizes everything inside.

This will allow her to improve her business and earn a higher income to fulfill her family needs and support the education of her children. Gloria serves as both a mother and father to her children. It is really hard, she said and she really is bringing out her best to become a successful parent to them.

Usapi Sonbai Village is situated about 29 Km from Kupang City. The community in this area leans on the agricultural sector to support their family lives. The main income comes from selling agricultural products such as bananas, coconuts and corn. There is no local market in this area, so the community has to get into the Inpres Market in Kupang City.\r\n\r\nSesawi A1 is led by Sem T., 32 years old. He is a married man.

The children are: Reman, 8 years old, in the 2nd grade of elementary school; Rali, 6 years old and Alfin, 2 months and not at school yet. \r\n\r\nTo meet his family's needs, Sem leans on the crops (coconut and cucumber). But usually, the income generated from selling the crops cannot cover all of their needs. He also has several goats that can be sold in an emergency.  Living as a farmer in a remote area really becomes a challenge for Sem. Lack of capital becomes the main issue for him to improve his living standard. This situation motivated Sem to join the TLM cattle-fattening program with a hope for a better future. His experience in raising goats for two years has given him the self confidence to join the program. Sem is requesting a loan of IDR 3,300,000 from TLM to buy young cattle to fatten in 12 months. He hopes that this loan will help him improve his living standard.

His parents are only poor farmers who couldn\u2019t afford to send him to the high school. As a result, Oktofianus only has a primary education. \r\n\r\nOktofianus is a married man with one child aged 10 months. Due to the low level of education that Oktofianus has, he can not get a better permanent job in the city. This is the reason why Oktofianus works as a farmer who plants corn, peanuts and vegetables to pay for his family's needs. The biggest challenge for Oktofianus is the increasing of prices in the market that makes it difficult for him to support his family. His income generated from farming is not enough to cover all of his family's needs. \r\n\r\nThe difficulties that Oktofianus faces have motivated him to find another way to support his family. One of the alternatives that has become his preference is to fatten cattle because of the high demand and good price for the fattened cattle. To fatten cattle Oktofianus needs capital to buy the young cattle and he can not afford it as a poor farmer. \r\n\r\nThis is the reason why Oktofianus is interested in joining the cattle fattening program with the other group members.

R. is from the village of Santiago, Iligan City. She is 25 years old. Jennelyn is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Jennelyn owns and operates a specialized business venture in the retail sector. While not the only means of generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling  scrap materials in their village. From the money she borrows from the organization, she will immediately procure a \"trisikad\" that will help her in buying scrap materials in their place. Jennelyn has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Jennelyn joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Jennelyn is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Jennelyn from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

M. is from the village of Sta. Felomina, Iligan City. She is 33 years old. Arlene is married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Arlene runs a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. The main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food and daily-use products in the local community. Arlene sells vegetables , spices  and other food products. Arlene has been engaged in her business for more than 11 years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Arlene joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Arlene is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the first loan taken out by Arlene from HSPFI, a Kiva partner. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the income of the family. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.
