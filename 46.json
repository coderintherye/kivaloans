Even though, it's a seasonal job since there is some time during the year that embroideries are not very sought after. Regardless, she dedicates her time all throughout the year  to make the best embroideries so that she can sell them during the religious holidays in her area such as Fiesta de Santiago.  This is when the demand is very high for her beautiful embroideries since they're very high-quality.<p>\r\nShe wishes to continue working in this type of art taking advantage of the fact that there's a lot of tourism in the area where she lives.  She is always striving to provide a much better quality on each of her work of art.  She needs to increase her income since now she has more bills to pay due to the fact that her 2 daughters are going to school, and she is recuperating from a recent surgery. But this doesn't stop her in anyway because she is full of strength and can't wait to get back to her daily work.<p>\r\nShe's asking each one of you to loan a little bit so that she can use this loan to increase the quality and variety of her products.<p>\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Carolina Zelaya-Kronlund, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nAydee es una mujer valiente y fuerte, es precisamente estas caracter\u00edsticas las   que en poco tiempo la han convertido en una de las mejores bordadoras de su localidad.\r\n\r\nIncursiona en esta actividad a ra\u00edz de que  una de sus amigas la anima a integrarse a un grupo que realizaba este  trabajo bordando  t\u00fanicas para su  exportaci\u00f3n y es as\u00ed que decide iniciar su traves\u00eda y hasta el d\u00eda de hoy  dedica su tiempo al desempe\u00f1o de esta labor  y se siente muy feliz por hacer lo que le agrada. \r\n\r\nEste trabajo le permite  generar aportes para incrementar su econom\u00eda familiar por temporadas ya que  existen \u00e9pocas  del a\u00f1o en las que el trabajo de bordados es escaso;

Once she learned the business, she joined the \"Mujeres con Futuro\" (Women With Futures) community bank because she needed new funds to support the business.  The bank gave her an initial loan of S\/.300 (300 Peruvian soles or about US$100) which she used to buy and sell cheese, a product that her customers demanded.  She also subsequently added sales of pork meat.\r\n<p>\r\nWith her own earnings and other loans from the community bank, she set up a small store in her house where she works most days so she only has to travel out to sell her products once a week now.\r\n<p>\r\nThe recently-granted loan of S\/.1,000 (about US$333) from Manuela Ramos, to be repaid in 4 months, will be used to buy merchandise like writing supplies and lamps for the store.  Sra. Narcisa dreams of having a large store with a range of products so that she can earn her living solely from it and give up the weekly trips to Mache to sell her goods.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva Volunteer<\/b><p>\r\nLa se\u00f1ora Narcisa tiene 70 a\u00f1os D. edad, actualmente vive en el distrito D.

In 2002 Mrs. P. borrowed 50USD to buy vegetable and sell it in the local market.  When another store was about to disintegrate, she found it a good opportunity to buy those household products at cheap price for her grocery store.  With her great experience and the high demand of local people and students from nearby schools, her store always attracts a lot of customers with a variety of products.  The smile on her face proves how her life has improved.  Her husband is now retired and helping her with her store.  Her oldest son graduated from college and starts to work.

She is a member of TYM fund since 2001.  In the beginning  the loans were of small amounts so she could only use it to buy goods to resell. The profit margin was small, it was difficult. As a side job, she offered child care service for the families in her neighborhood. The demand was so great that the idea of opening a child care center was germinated in her head. She consulted her family members about this and decided to do so. At first, there were a lot of obstacles:  lack of capital,  lack of  material  and especially the paperwork procedure from the Education Ministry was lengthy and complicated. It also took a lot of effort and time to attend \"child care education\" classes to obtain the permit. After a few years of hard work and dedication, everything was set in place. She gained trust and support from everyone including the Education Ministry and her customers. Her husband is very supportive, everyday he  goes to the market to buy grocery to prepare food for the kids. The child care center is quite neat, there are 5 classes under the supervision of 5 teachers specialized in young children education. There are about 100 kids attending the child care center. Ms Tuy\u1ebft is a  examplary member for the Xu\u00e2n H\u00f2a branch of TYM fund.

It was very difficult for her family to get a loan. All the banks required collateral. Since her family was in a difficult financial situation, it was impossible to qualify for a loan. When TYM fund opened a branch in Qu\u1ea3ng X\u01b0\u01a1ng, she could qualify for loans from TYM because it was based on trust and support between women. With the loans, she buys fishes and resells at the market. The living condition of her family is not high standard but it had improved a lot. Everyday, she sells fishes at the market, she brings home about 125 USD a month. Her wish is to qualify for bigger loans.

When her husband was still in the army and on duty away from home, H\u1ee3i had to make a living and raised their children by herself. The main fish suppliers for her inventory are the fishermen in her village. When her oldest child bought a fishing boat and started working for his own, H\u1ee3i joined TYM fund and invested her loan in the fishing equipment. Now that her son supplies her fishes, she makes bigger profit. Everyday, she and her daughter in law go to the market to sell fishes, their revenue is about 130 USD a month. Her husband is now a retiree and receives 125 USD a month from the state pension.

Crecencia Oritiz, 46, is married with four children. The older two are now married and live with their spouses. The younger two are in school, one of them studies at the local high school and the other is in college. Juan Matto, Crecencia\u00b4s husband, has contributed to the household income through his job at a poultry farm. In 2003 they decided to begin raising chickens and have been doing well since that time. \r\nThe process of raising and feeding the chickens takes much work and patience.

It is the most important one of Villa.Pagador<p>\r\nShe has been selling food for many years and she and her husband are very well known in the area, especially by the people of the line of taxi-trufis. They have very good personal references. There is a low competition for Elena\u2019s business because of it\u2019s location. It is located in the taxi-trufis central, so it is easier for all the taxi-trufi drivers to consume her products. In addition that she has an excellent and extroverted character that helps to have lots of clients, even from other taxi lines.<p>\r\nShe is asking for a loan of U$550  to buy supplies for her business such as rice, spaghettis, potatoes, etc. She has had two previous loans with an average of low delay, in general she demonstrated to have good behavior so a second loan was granted to

Besides saving man-power, it's also more efficient. We can raise Kereman cows faster so that we can sell it in 4 to 6 months. Therefore, I Nyoman Kartikayasa used the loan from Dinari to buy 1 cow (2-3 years old) which cost Rp. 3,500,000 (about $386). The rest of the loan was used to cover the cow's food expense. I Nyoman Kartikayasa feeds the cow twice a day in the morning and in the evening. The basic food is processed food made from the mixture of rice chaff, corn and ground soyabean dregs. The estimated cow's food per kg is Rp. 1,500 (about $0.16) (Rp.1,500 x 120 days = Rp. 180,000 -- about $20). This processed cow's food is given every morning. In the afternoon, he feeds the cow with natural food such as grass, jackfruit leaves, and cocoa skin which contained good protein for cow. When the harvest time comes, the cow's weight was 415 kg and its price is Rp. 15,000 (about $1.65) per kg. Hence, the net income (after subtracted with the initial capital and cow's food expense) was Rp. 2,545,000 (about $281). I Nyoman Kartikayasa is very pleased with this business. He hopes to get more loans from Dinari so that he can raise more cows. He can use the income to cover his family's daily expenses.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Indonesian by Kustini Lim, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nDi Kabupaten Jembrana, Bali Barat,  pemeliharaan sapi Kereman ( sapi yang dikandangkan ) sangat diminati oleh masyarakat . Selain menghemat tenaga, juga lebih efisien. Dengan adanya sapi kereman yang pemeliharaannya cepat, jangka waktu 4 - 6 bulan sudah siap untuk dijual. Oleh sebab itu lewat Dinari, I Nyoman Kartikayasa memperoleh modal pinjaman Modal ini dipergunakan untuk membeli 1 ekor sapi yang sudah cukup besar ( umur 2 \u2013 3 tahun ) dengan harga Rp. 3.500.000,-. Sisanya dipakai untuk biaya pakan.. Sapi kereman I Nyoman Kartikayasa diberi makan 2 kali setiap pagi dan sore hari. Makanan pokoknya makanan olahan ( konsentrat ) yang terbuat dari dedak padi yang kasar, jagung, ampas kedelai yang dihaluskan kemudian dicampur menjadi satu. Perkiraan harga pakan per kilogram adalah Rp.1.500,- ( Rp. 1.500.- X 120 hari = Rp. 180.000.- )\r\nPakan olahan diberikan pada pagi hari dan untuk siang hari diberi makanan alami sebagai makanan tambahan seperti rumput, daun nangka dan kulit coklat ( kakao ) yang proteinnya bagus untuk sapi. \r\nPada saat panen berat sapi I Nyoman Kartikayasa 415 kg dengan harga per kg Rp.15,000,-. Jadi pendapatan bersih setelah dipotong modal sapi dan pakan yang menjadi Rp. 2.545.000,- selama empat bulan. I Nyoman Kartikayasa sangat senang dengan usahanya ini . Harapannya supaya pinjaman dari Dinari bisa meningkat agar bisa pelihara lebih dari 1 ekor. Dengan keuntungan ini bisa dipakai untuk keperluan rumah tangganya."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":80277,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To

A. is 44 years old, married and has 4 children. She has a high school education. She has been selling children's clothing for the past 3 years. Because her husband is in Russia earning money for the family it is up to her to take care of the children. After the Soviet Union fell apart, she has lost her job and decided to try working in sales. In order to increase turnover and purchase more goods, she became a client of MicroInvest. Back in 2005 her assets amounted to $600. Currently she has a permanent point of sales in one of the main markets of the region. In the future she is planing to increase the selection of goods she has to offer and start selling adult clothing as well. \r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Jane Mazur, Kiva

V. is 33 years old. He has a college education, is married and has 4 children. He has extensive experience in the field of cattle raising because he was helping his parents raise cattle since early childhood. He has his own house with all the necessary conditions needed to raise cattle. He became a client of MicroInvest back in 2006. Back then his assets amounted to $400 and he had only two calves in his possession. Thanks to MicroInvest he was able to increase the amount of cattle he owns and stock up on cattle feed for the winter. In the future he is planing to acquire more milk cows and better the conditions the animals are held in.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Jane Mazur, Kiva

She used to not have a permanent point of sale and had to buy her goods for credit, which significantly reduced the profitability of her business.

Some time ago, Maria started out selling in the market, but due to relocation issues she had to find a location of her own to continue her business and helping to support her family.

The rest of the loan was used to built the barn for the cow and to purchase cow food for 4 months. He feeds the cow twice a day, in the morning and in the evening. In the afternoon, he feeds the cows with grass and leaves as supplements. He bought food concentrate from the merchants in his village. The food concentrate cost Rp. 1,500 (about $0.16) per kg. The Kereman cow is given 1 kg food concentrate with sugar cane liquid, salt, and some water. After 4 months passes, the cow with 400 kg of weight can be sold for Rp. 16,500 (about $1.8) per kg.

Due to the increasing family expenses and their children's high school fees, Ni Nyoman Noli decided to start breeding pigs. She got the initial capital from Dinari.

Her pigpen is very simple with bamboo wall and cement floor. Everyday she cleans the pigpen, and then feeds the pigs with food mixtures such as rice chaff, tofu concentrate and dregs. The food cost her Rp. 1,000,000 (about $110). The revenue from selling the pigs were Rp. 2,000,000 (about $221) so the net income was Rp. 500,000 (about $55). She is very grateful that the earned profit can be used to support her children.

Modal yang didapatnya diperoleh dari Dinari . Dari modal ini Ni Nyoman Noli  membeli 2 ekor babi penggemukan dengan harga satu ekor Rp.250.000,- jadi 2 babi harganya Rp.500.000,-. Sisa dari pembelian bibit dipakai untuk modal pakan selama 6 bulan. Kondisi kandang babi Nyoman Noli sederhana, dinding dari bambu dan lantai semen. Setiap hari Ni Nyoman Noli rajin membersihkan kandangnya, setelah itu baru babinya diberi makan dengan campuran makanannya seperti dedak padi, konsentrat dan ampas tahu. Sampai babi siap dipanen, menghabiskan biaya pakan sebesar Rp.1.000.000,-. Sedangkan pendapatan kotornya Rp.2.000.000,- jadi pendapatan bersihnya Rp.500.000,-.

As cabbage farmers, they require at least 3 months, from preparing the land for planting cabbage seeds to harvesting.  They prepare the land through mutual cooperation.  Before the field is ready for preparation, they are aerated.  This will make the field easier for the process.  When the fields and seed are ready they are planted.  Thereafter commences the care.  They need fertilizer for nutrition and pesticide for the insects.   The amount of water also needs to be controlled, not too much or too little.  These activities are carried out till almost harvest.  Their effort will generate a profit of Rp 3.000.000,00 (about USD330) per person.  This amount is attained from 3 months of farming.

Sebagai petani cabe mereka membutuhkan waktu kurang lebih 3 bulan, mulai dari persiapan lahan untuk ditanami bibit cabe sampai dengan saat panen. Mereka mempersiapkan lahan dengan cara bergotong royong. Sebelum lahan siap untuk diolah, perlu diairi dengan cukup. Hal ini akan membuat lahan menjadi gembur-mudah untuk diolah. Setelah lahan dan bibit cabe siap, maka dilakukan penanaman. Pada masa-masa berikutnya merupakan masa perawatan. Mereka perlu memberikan pupuk-untuk nutrisi-dan atau pestisida \u2013untuk membasmi serangga. Jumlah air juga perlu dikontrol. Jumlah air tidak boleh terlalu banyak atau terlalu sedikit. Aktivitas ini mereka lakukan sampai menjelang masa panen. Usaha yang mereka lakukan tersebut memberikan keuntungan sebesar Rp 3.000.000,00\/orang. Nilai ini mereka peroleh setelah 3 bulan penantian. Selain cabe mereka juga menanam padi dan tomat. Pergantian tanaman ini mereka lakukan sesuai dengan kesepakatan bersama.

Apart from rice, they also grow hot peppers and peanuts.  This subsidy crop is carried out by mutual consensus.  Each family\u2019s daily expense of Rp 30.000,00 (USD3) will be less if they already have their own rice.  This loan will be used to purchase padi seeds, manure, care and working expenses.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Indonesian to English by Pheng Tan, Kiva volunteer.<\/b> <p>\r\n\r\nKelompok tani ini terletak di Br. Bluangan, Desa Perean Kangin, Baturiti, Tabanan. Kelompok yang diketuai oleh I Wayan Purna ini beranggotakan : I Nyoman Joni, I Gede Suandi, I Ketut Sudiarta dan I Wayan Keret. Sebagai petani padi mereka membutuhkan waktu kurang lebih 6 bulan, mulai dari persiapan lahan untuk ditanami bibit padi sampai dengan saat panen. Mereka mempersiapkan lahan dengan cara bergotong royong. Aktivitas ini mereka lakukan sampai menjelang masa panen. Usaha yang mereka lakukan tersebut memberikan keuntungan sebesar Rp 3.000.000,00\/orang. Nilai ini mereka peroleh setelah 6 bulan penantian. Selain padi mereka juga menanam cabai dan kacang. Pergantian tanaman ini mereka lakukan sesuai dengan kesepakatan bersama. Biaya hidup per hari Rp 30.000,00\/keluarga akan lebih ringan, jika mereka memiliki persediaan beras sendiri. Pinjaman yang mereka peroleh akan mereka pakai untuk membeli bibit padi, pupuk, biaya perawatan dan ongkos kerja."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1650,"image":{"id":80538,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase rice seeds, manure, care and working expenses (Membeli bibit padi, pupuk, biaya perawatan dan ongkos kerja)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Badung","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.5 115.333333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2007-11-02T14:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"I Wayan Purna","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"I Nyoman Joni","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"I Gede Suandi","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"I Ketut Sudiarta","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"I Wayan Keret","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-11-17T01:43:19Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":15000000,"loan_amount":1650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":2500000},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":2500000},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":2500000},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2500000},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2500000},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":275}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":275,"local_amount":2500000,"processed_date":"2007-12-17T10:23:34Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-17T09:04:26Z","rounded_local_amount":2501730.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":98428,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":275,"local_amount":2500000,"processed_date":"2008-01-17T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-17T09:04:26Z","rounded_local_amount":2501730.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":117118,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":275,"local_amount":2500000,"processed_date":"2008-02-17T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-17T09:04:26Z","rounded_local_amount":2501730.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":137101,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":275,"local_amount":2500000,"processed_date":"2008-03-17T10:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-17T09:04:26Z","rounded_local_amount":2501730.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159864,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":275,"local_amount":2500000,"processed_date":"2008-04-17T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-17T09:04:26Z","rounded_local_amount":2501730.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":184688,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":275,"local_amount":2500000,"processed_date":"2008-05-17T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-17T09:04:26Z","rounded_local_amount":2501730.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":212344,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2007-11-03T00:43:19Z","paid_date":"2008-05-17T09:04:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":23030,"name":"Junior","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"I am concerned about the security of my children.

These women have an unequalled spirit.  A confidence and a hope was reflected in their faces during the pre-credit meetings (four informational sessions that are given to potential clients of Friendship Bridge in order to help them administer their credit and their business in the best manner).  The average loan that each one of these clients will receive is $264 in six payments. <p>\r\nDuring their childhood and adolescence, many of these women worked as artisans, since the majority of indigenous women are taught the art of weaving traditional clothing as children.  In addition, many of them have worked as housekeepers in their respective homes.  However, these women, along with the help of Friendship Bridge, are no longer going to follow that path, since they have opted to become successful micro-entreprenuers. <p> \r\nThese women have been becoming micro-entrepenuers for a long time; however, they have not been able to get ahead in the the field of their respective businesses due to a lack of capital.  Thanks to the credit that they will receive, the women will be able to invest their credit in distinct economic areas.  For example, the credit will be used to buy clothing in bulk and resell it, to buy wholesale materials for making \u201chuipiles\u201d (traditional Guatemalan dresses), to buy chickens and pigs and begin a livestock business, to buy flowers in bulk and sell them during the day of the dead (a traditional holiday in Guatemala during which you show respect for relatives who have died), to buy wood wholesale in order to resell it in the villages, and finally, to buy rice, milk and chocolate and to strengthen a coffee break stand. <p>\r\nThe dreams of these women, like the majority of our clients, are that their businesses will grow in order to be able to give their children a better future.  Mrs. Mar\u00eda L.

With this money Alma will be able to stock her business and increase her sales. \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by Yvette D\u00edaz, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nDespu\u00e9s de que el padre de Alma Delfina le diera un derrame cerebral ella comenz\u00f3 a vender ropa de ella y de su familia, puesto que su padre era el sustento de su casa, y as\u00ed comenzo a vender para poder sacar para los gastos de su casa y del medicamento que tanto necesita su padre, todo esto fue hace 17 a\u00f1os, y de ah\u00ed en adelante ella se a dedicado a este oficio, actualmente ya se encuentra m\u00e1s establecida en un mercado y con mucho esfuerzo a ido haciendo de clientes que la buscan para comprarle ropa y as\u00ed ayudarla a su sustento.<p>\r\n\r\nAlma considera, (y est\u00e1 en lo cierto) que las fechas de navidad es cuando las personas m\u00e1s est\u00e1n interesadas en comprar algun regalo para sus failiares, y es po esto que ella est\u00e1 solicitando un cr\u00e9dito de US $ 675 que est\u00e1 dispuesta a pagar en un plazo de 6 meses y con ese dinero Alma podr\u00e1 surtir su negocio y as\u00ed tener m\u00e1s ventas."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":80627,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"Purchase merchandise for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Hermosillo, Sonora","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"29.066667 -110.966667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":16,"posted_date":"2007-11-02T01:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alma Delfina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-11-16T14:56:43Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":7000,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1166.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":226,"local_amount":2343.7,"processed_date":"2007-12-02T20:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-02T09:04:49Z","rounded_local_amount":2426.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":108417,"comment":"scheduled_repayment (late autopay posting)"},{"amount":113,"local_amount":1171.85,"processed_date":"2008-02-02T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-02T09:04:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1213.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":126516,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":113,"local_amount":1171.85,"processed_date":"2008-03-02T10:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-02T09:04:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1213.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":147135,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":113,"local_amount":1171.85,"processed_date":"2008-04-02T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-02T09:04:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1213.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":171362,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":110,"local_amount":1140.74,"processed_date":"2008-05-02T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-02T09:04:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1180.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":198559,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2007-11-02T13:56:43Z","paid_date":"2008-05-02T09:04:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":23051,"name":"Griselda","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Griselda is a good mother and a good wife, who supports her husband is any way she can.

With your help, Carolina will be able to support her daughters, in spite of the grief she carries for the loss of her husband.\r\n\r\n<P><b>Translated from Spanish by Eliana Colunga, Kiva Volunteer<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nCarolina Esther, sufri\u00f3 la terrible p\u00e9rdida de su esposo, quien era el que manten\u00eda a ella y a sus cuatro hijas quienes est\u00e1n estudiando y necesitan de dinero para poder comprar sus \u00fatiles escolares.

He prepares the green plants  to feed his cattles. Since he joined DINARI, Made bought a cattle for 3,500,000 IDR (USD~9,000 IDR) from a friend in a neighboring village and bought wheat pollard for additional feed. Every morning, I Made Hermanto washes his cattle to keep it clean. Feeding the cattle and cleaning the stall are done three times a day, morning, noon and afternoon. It took him two hours to complete the tasks. The rest of the time was spent working on his crops.  The cattle feeds cost him 3,000 IDR per day. After three months, I Made Hermanto sells his cattle and plans on getting another cattle to be raised again. A cattle was sold for 4,900,000 IDR with a net profit of 1,000,000 IDR in three months. With the loan, Made Hermanto plans on adding more cattle to increase his income. \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Arliadi Mahadi, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nDitengah tengah kesibukan sebagi petani Made Hermanto melengkapi usahanya dengan memelihara sapi. Persiapan pakan hijauan memang disediakan dari dulu untuk memenuhi pakannya. Semenjak bergabung menjadi client Yayasan DINARI Made membeli satu ekor sapi dengan harga Rp.3.500.000,- dari temannya yang ada di desa tetangga dan membeli dedak gandum sebagai pakan jadi untuk pakan tambahan. Setiap pagi, I Made Hermanto selalu memandikan sapinya agar kebersiahan dan kesehatannya terjaga. Pembersihan kandang dan pemberian pakan dilakukan dalam sehari sebanyak tiga kali yaitu pagi, siang dan sore. Waktu yang diperlukan hanya dua jam saja.Waktu selebihnya dipakai untuk bekerja dan mengurus kebunnya untuk menambah pemasukan keuangan dalam keluarganya. Biaya pakan dalam setiap hari mencapai Rp. 3.000,-. Setelah tiga bulan masa pemeliharaan, I Made Hermanto menjual sapinya dan rencananya akan membeli lagi sapi dengan harga yang lebih murah dan dipelihara kembali. Sapi dijual dengan harga Rp.4.900.000,-dengan keuntungan  bersih mencapai Rp. 1.000.000,- dalam tiga bulan pelihara. Dengan pinjaman yang didapatnya, I Made Hermanto berencana untuk menambah populasi sapinya agar pendapatannya dari beternak sapi lebih meningkat."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":80898,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To

Because otherwise, it's very difficult to ensure that the children can study. <p>\r\nIf business goes well in the future, some of these women plan to improve their homes, while others want to save money to pay for their children's schooling, for them to continue as long as possible.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Portuguese by a Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nAs 5 senhoras nao sao casadas oficialmente mas cada uma delas vive com um homem com quem tem filhos.Elina tem 3 filhos,Lina tem 6 filhos, Helena tem 3 filhos, Argentina tem 7 filhos e Lucia tem 4 filhos.Os homens com os quais estas senhoras vivem nao estao empregados.
