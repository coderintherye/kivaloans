separaci\u00f3n de su esposo la motiv\u00f3 a buscar trabajo hace tres a\u00f1os con la finalidad de sustentar a sus hijos, empez\u00f3 con la venta de pescado en el terminal pesquero de la zona y contin\u00faa en esta actividad hasta la actualidad: junto a un grupo de vecinas suelen esperar en el muelle de Pimentel (Balneario ubicado a 10 minutos del distrito) a las embarcaciones que vienen al muelle luego de sus jornadas de pesca para comprarles pescado y venderlo luego en el terminal a diversos comerciantes de la regi\u00f3n.\n\nEl negocio le brind\u00f3 temporalmente los ingresos que necesitaba pero las continuas temporadas de veda la hicieron pensar en otro negocio con el cual seguir sustentando a su familia, fue as\u00ed como instal\u00f3 en su casa una peque\u00f1a bodega \u2013 tienda en la cual vende productos de primera necesidad (arroz, az\u00facar, aceite); frutas, verduras y golosinas.\n\nEste negocio es atendido por su hija mayor por las ma\u00f1anas y por ella en las tardes; Tomasa a\u00fan vende pescado en el terminal pero sin captar los ingresos que antes percib\u00eda. Ella desea implementar su tiendita para dejar de vender pescado y dedicarle m\u00e1s tiempo a sus hijos; por este motivo se encuentra solicitando a Edpyme Alternativa un cr\u00e9dito de 1500 nuevos soles que piensa utilizar en el logro de su objetivo.\n\nTomasa desea incursionar con la venta de \u00fatiles escolares en su negocio, ya que en la zona en donde vive no existe ning\u00fan establecimiento de ese tipo y los ni\u00f1os del lugar (incluyendo a sus hijos) tienen que caminar hasta el centro de la ciudad para agenciarse de material de trabajo.\n\nEste es su primer pr\u00e9stamo con Edpyme Alternativa, ella es muy conocida por sus vecinos los cuales la admiran y aprecian ya que es una mujer luchadora que ha sabido sacar adelante a su familia a pesar de las adversidades.\n","en":"Tomasa is 33 years old, is separated and takes care of her three children who are 11, 10 and 6 years old.  They live in the district of Santa Rosa, located 25 minutes of the city of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\n<p>The separation from her husband motivated her to look for a job three years ago in order to support her children.  She started selling fish in the fishing terminal and continues the activity to this day.  Tomasa along with a group of her neighbors, usually wait in the Pimentel pier (Balneario some 10 minutes from the district) for the boats who come to the dock after their fishing workday ends to buy their fish and sell them later in the terminal to various merchants in the region.\r\n\r\n<p>The fishing business temporarily gave her the necessary funds to survive but the close season made her consider going into another business to keep supporting her family.  She set up in her home a small grocery store, where she sells basic household goods (rice, sugar, and oil); fruits, vegetables and candy.\r\n\r\n<p> This business is taken care of by her eldest daughter in the mornings and by Tomasa in the afternoons.  She still sells fish in the terminal but does not gain the same profit as before.  She wishes to maintain her store and stop selling fish to dedicate more time to her children.  This is why she is asking Edpyme Alternativa (kiva\u2019s field partner) for a loan of 1500 nuevos soles that she will use to meet her goal.\r\n\r\n<p>Tomasa wishes to sell school supplies in her business as well, since the place where she lives there aren\u2019t any businesses of this type and the children (including hers) have to walk to the center of the city to get their school supplies.\r\n\r\n<p> This will be her first loan with Edpyme Alternativa.

M. is from the village of Sto.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling ready to wear items and used clothing to local community members. Monico is just starting this business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Monico joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Monico has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to invest in expanding the business. Monico is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional fabrics and materials. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Monico from HSPFI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to grow the business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is an accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

To make a living, Julleta runs a specialized retail store which sells ready-to-wear items as well as used clothing in the local community. She has run her business for over a year, and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Julleta joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Julleta has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase new stock to expand. Julleta is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Julleta from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve\/expand the borrower's business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Sherly has run the business for over five years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month from it.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Sherly joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Sherly has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase stock to expand her product range. Sherly is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Sherly from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to expand and improve her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

The official name of this borrowing group is 10.1 Nam Ng\u1ea1n (02.10.1.1).<p>\r\n\r\n\r\nThanh is married and has 2 adult children.

Thanh has been engaged in this business for over 4 years and earns approximately 2.000.000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Thanh joined Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Thanh has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1.626.900 VND from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  This previous loan was used to invest in expanding the business.  She is now requesting a new loan of 6.000.000 VND which will be used to invest in expanding the business.

G. is from the village of Bucana, Sicayab.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for sale. Pablita has been engaged in her business for over 5 years with an approximate average monthly earnings of 2,500 PHP a month for these activities.\n\nIn 2006, Pablita joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Pablita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase livestock feed & other supplies. Pablita is requesting a new loan of 14,900 PHP which will be used for the same purpose. This loan will be the 4th loan taken out by Pablita from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to save as a reserve for future emergencies. \n\nAbout PMPC:\n\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Ruben has been engaged in his business for over 10 years and earns approximately 3000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Ruben joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Ruben is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand his product offering. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Ruben from HSPFI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand his business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

She lives at home with her two children, Guillermo (age 14) and Daysi (age 16).  They are the main reason for everything she does.  Maria operates a pushcart from which she sells candy at Bolognesi Park (a large park in the city of Juliaca).  She is well-known among her customers for her good humor and charisma, as well as for being in a good location.  Maria says she enjoys talking with her customers and making them laugh.

P. is from the village of Bigaan. She is 54 years old. Norberta is married and has 10 adult children. To make a living, Norberta owns and operates a service-based business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from providing transportation services to local community members. Norberta has been engaged in her business for over 4 years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Norberta joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Norberta has successfully repaid a previous loan from PMPC. Norberta is requesting a new loan of 3000 PHP which will be used to repair a transport vehicle used in the business. This loan will be the ninth loan taken out by Norberta from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

residents of Naivasha must buy water from water vendors, because the town council cannot provide enough water for everyone. This is where Harrison thrives, because he has been seling water in the town for close to seven years, using his donkey to pull the cart loaded with water.\r\n\r\nHarrison is 27 years old and married to Jane Muthoni. They have one school-going child.\r\n\r\nHe was intoduced to Kadet by his friend. He repaid his loan promptly and he used it to buy more tanks for storing water. He is now applying for his second loan. He plans to use the loan funds to buy another donkey and cart to help him meet the ever-rising needs of his clientele and to also reach more new clients.

Merlinda is requesting a new loan of 12000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the 8th loan taken out by Merlinda from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of the borrower's family. \n\nAbout PMPC:\n\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

It is a community that is mixed with both poor and middle class Liberians, but the rate of poverty is high.\r\n\r\nA.B Joseph's business is agricultural activities. He grows different kinds of plants for consumption, like cabbage, potatoes, lettuce, cassava leaves, etc., which he sells to the residents of Brewer V., northern Monrovia, Liberia. He started this business six years ago. When he graduated from university, he decided to get into agriculture. Since Joseph got into agriculture, that has been the means of taking care of his family. The way Joseph speaks and interacts with his customers makes them always want to buy from him. \r\n\r\nHe needs this loan in order to purchase agricultural materials like fertilizer, seeds of different kinds, a digger and a shovel in order to improve his business. His dream is to have a big farm with which he can serve at least Monrovia, and to educate his children for their future to come.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":396804,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase fertilizer, seeds, and farming tools","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"LR","country":"Liberia","town":"Monrovia North","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"6.5 -9.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":141,"posted_date":"2009-09-30T14:40:20Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"A.b.

He is 53, married and the father of seven children with ages between 13 and 35. He finished 12th grade and had to drop school to support his family. He lives in Boane and owns his house. His three oldest children are married and live with their families. \r\n\r\nQuiza lived in other countries for a long time (Tanzania, Congo and other places in Central Africa), as his parents were politicians and worked in different countries. It was in Tanzania that Quiza learned how to do business, as a survival strategy after his parents passed away. In 2002 he was repatriated and decided to set residence in Boane with his family. He has a shop where he sells construction supplies (cement, iron, rocks and others) and he makes about 3.000,00MT (about U$ 110) per day, which he uses to support his family and improve his business. Besides running the store, he also raises chicken for a living. \r\n\r\nThis is going to be his 4th loan, in the amount of 26.000,00MT (U$ 950) to buy construction materials to build a convenience store. His objective is to diversify his businesses to make more money. The other three loans were used to buy construction supplies and chicken. \r\n\r\nHe plans on paying the loan quickly so he can apply for other loans in order to finish building his new convenience store and improve the business he already has.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Mariana Dauwe, Kiva

(south of the Maputo bay). She is 56 years old, married and the mother of five children, four of them adults and a 12 year old girl who attends school in Boane. Rasse didn't have the chance to study, because back in her day there was a myth that \"school is for boys only\". She lives in her own house with her children, a niece and two nephews who are orphans. Rasse's parents were farmers and she left CaT. for Boane in 1969 after an arranged marriage, a traditional costume in some African countries. \r\n\r\nShe sells vegetables and cereals for a living since 1970, and has no other employees. Her husband is also a farmer, though without a formal job, and helps her with her business from time to time. She makes around 5.200,00MT (U$173) per month, money that she uses to support her family.\r\n\r\nThis is Rasse's 4th loan and she's asking for 20.000,00MT (U$ 725), money that she'll use to buy vegetables and cereals and sell in the farmers market in Boane. She thinks she can improve her household's income by improving her business, and has plans to open her own store in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

A. is from the village of San Roque.

To make a living, Paz owns and operates a \"sari-sari\" (general) store, where she sells a variety of different products in the local community. Paz has been in business for over five years and earns approximately 7,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, Paz joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Paz has successfully repaid a previous loan from PMPC. Paz is requesting a new loan of 30,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the 12th loan taken out by Paz from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

(17km from Boane) in Mozambique. She is a 49 year old widow with six children, four of them students. She finished 3rd grade but had to drop school because of her parent's financial difficulties. She got married when she was 20 and her husband passed away 5 years ago, leaving her to take care of all the children plus two of her brothers that live in her house. Her parents have also passed away years ago and she supports her family by selling basic food and cleaning products. She makes around 4.000,00MT (U$138) per month, and with that money she's able to support her family and save a little bit every month. This is her 4th loan and she's asking for 15.000,00MT (U$550) to buy construction supplies (cement, paint and others). She plans on paying the loan without a problem so she can take more loans and finish building her house, as well as improve her business. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Mariana Dauwe,

Nenita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to repair a transport vehicle used in the business. Nenita is requesting a new loan of 25,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase a transport vehicle to improve the business. This loan will be the sixth loan taken out by Nenita from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's general living conditions. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

She has been both mother and father to them since she and her husband parted ways years ago for domestic reasons she opted to keep to herself. Life was hard for her then, but she was able to cope and move on thanks to her faith in the Almighty. She found consolation in getting into business. She also sells fresh pork meat.

She earns more than 45,000 PHP a month from these business activities.\r\n\r\nShe became a member of the Center for Community Transformation (CCT) Credit Cooperative in 2005. She applied for a new loan with the cooperative in the amount of 20,000 PHP to have available funds for the renovation of her pig pen. She would like to extend her pen because her pigs are now crammed inside it. She only used to have six pigs. Now, she already has nine mother pigs and many growing baby pigs.\r\n\r\nAlicia hopes to acquire a farm lot where she can build a bigger pig farm complex. She also wishes to build an apartment.

This loan will be the 13th loan taken out by Mercilyn from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

is Arlene R., who is 47 years old. She lives in Pasay City. Her husband, Nelson, 45, is a house painter. They have three children.\r\n\r\nArlene is a multi-tasking businesswoman. She has a general store in front of her house. She also sells frozen meat products. She also converted a few rooms in her house as apartments for rent. She earns nearly 25,000 PHP a month from these business activities. Her profits are used to support her family\u2019s daily needs. She is also sending her grandchildren to school.\r\n\r\nShe joined the Center for Community Transformation (CCT) Credit Cooperative in 2004.  Having been a member has brought her many blessings.  Through the loans from the cooperative and combined with her savings from her profits, she acquired a residential lot which is now continuously amortizing. Her next project would be to build a house for her family and leave their current house for rent. Arlene applied for a new loan from the Cooperative in the amount of 18,000 PHP.  She will use the funds to renovate her apartment.\r\n\r\nAbout CCT\r\n\r\nThe Center for Community Transformation (CCT) is an organized Christian response against poverty and social injustice.  This is carried out through the fusion of social development initiatives and evangelical mission in a uniquely Filipino context.  It serves urban and rural poor communities throughout the Philippines, in pursuit of its desire to see changed lives, strong families, and transformed communities centered in the Lordship of Jesus Christ.  \r\n\r\nCCT is a member of the Five Talents family.\r\n\r\n

This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

She is also able to take care of her children\u2019s expenses like clothing, private teachers, and outings.\r\n\r\nShe would like to be able to move her eight year old to a private school (which she plans on doing next year).\r\nWith this loan, she plans to invest in the purchase of shoes that she will sell in the same way she sells beauty products.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Shelly Hubman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":396906,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Invest in a new line of business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2009-10-07T07:10:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eladio Segundo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Silvia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Donatila Eulalia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Liz Abigail","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Lucero","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Luisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Delia Cristina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Blanca Odilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Estela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":4300,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1433.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1433.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1433.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":500,"local_amount":1433.33,"processed_date":"2009-11-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:11:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1440,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103780196,"comment":null},{"amount":250,"local_amount":716.67,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T12:46:59Z","rounded_local_amount":720,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110669064,"comment":null},{"amount":750,"local_amount":2150,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:15:28Z","rounded_local_amount":2160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118064524,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-10-22T09:12:13Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T11:15:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":141004,"name":"Las Estrellita Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El grupo Estrella est\u00e1 integrado por Lorena G., Sobeyda H., Ruth C. y Geraldine C., ellas habitan en el barrio san Judas de Managua.\n\nLorena del Carmen G.

Magreth thanks you for your support!\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":396924,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To purchase clothes in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-09-29T17:00:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Magreth ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:44:56Z","rounded_local_amount":54791.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103868325,"comment":null},{"amount":41.66,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:47:04Z","rounded_local_amount":54791.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757521,"comment":null},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:53Z","rounded_local_amount":54791.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146615,"comment":null},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:16:26Z","rounded_local_amount":54791.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123984760,"comment":null},{"amount":41.66,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:01:31Z","rounded_local_amount":54791.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129015433,"comment":null},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:03:19Z","rounded_local_amount":54791.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136740439,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-09-29T20:59:31Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:03:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":141014,"name":"Successful Women Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Successful Women is a group of five borrowers led by Sarah M., 32 years old, a single mother with two children aged 1 and 10 years old, with the oldest child's educational level at 5th grade.

She gives them what they need since she cannot offer them much more. In spite of her hard work, she does not make much money and the little she makes she has saved to acquire a small plot of land, where she has made a small wooden house, as she calls her \"chocita\".\r\n\r\nShe would like very much to make the money necessary to fix her house, and to make her children more comfortable because they are in need because of the cold season and their lack of appropriate clothing.\r\n\r\nThe loan requested will be invested in buying ingredients to make the \"ceviche de chocho\" and to sell <em>chicha de jora<\/em> (a maize-based drink).\r\n\r\n<br

from Tanzania! This is 28-year-old Severina C. from Mbeya, married with three children between the ages of 2 and 12. Since 1998 she has been running a clothing business.  Working for 9-12  hours per day, six days per week, Severina currently earns about $150 USD per month and is now requesting a loan in order to purchase clothes in bulk for her business. In the future, she plans to improve both the quality and range of her products. Severina thanks you for your support!<p>\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":396960,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To purchase clothes in bulk ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-09-30T18:30:23Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Severina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":600000,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.16},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.16},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:45:21Z","rounded_local_amount":104104.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103868331,"comment":null},{"amount":79.16,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:45:28Z","rounded_local_amount":104104.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757527,"comment":null},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:58Z","rounded_local_amount":104104.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146621,"comment":null},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:16:31Z","rounded_local_amount":104104.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123984766,"comment":null},{"amount":79.16,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:01:26Z","rounded_local_amount":104104.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129015439,"comment":null},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:03:15Z","rounded_local_amount":104104.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136740445,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-10-01T03:32:38Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:03:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":141028,"name":"Victor Manuel","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Victor vive con su esposa la se\u00f1ora Loida y son padres de 3 ni\u00f1as, 1 de edad de preparatoria y las otras dos son unas peque\u00f1itas, son una familia muy estable , trabajadora y emprendedora, la se\u00f1ora Loida es propietaria de una tiendita de abarrotes de nombre \u201cSarita\u201d y el es propietario de un taller de soldadura de nombre \u201cEl Jarocho\u201d establecido desde hace 19 a\u00f1os que con esfuerzo y dedicaci\u00f3n lo ha mantenido vigente, el esta solicitando este cr\u00e9dito con apoyo de su esposa para la compra de mas mercanc\u00eda y el mejoramiento del local;

She has a business in food sales that she has been managing with her husband for ten years.  She lives in the Laureles Norte neighborhood in the capital city of Managua.  She has two children in primary school, who are 7 and 12 years old.  When she began the business, she did it with little savings and with a group loan.  Later on, she applied to borrow with Kiva partner Afodenic and is now on the fourth loan cycle.  She has benefited from the low interest rates and maintained her sales.  With this loan she will purchase basic grains and perishable goods to increase her food sales and be able to earn greater earnings, finish constructing her house, and support her children's studies.

C. is from the village of Militar, Tukuran, Zamboanga del Sur. She is 33 years old, is married, and has three school-aged children.\r\n\r\nGena owns and operates a business running a \"balot\" food stall in the local community. A balot or balut is a fertilized duck (or chicken) egg with a nearly-developed embryo inside that is boiled and eaten in the shell. Gena has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Gena joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell.\r\n\r\nGena is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding her business. This loan will be her third from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family\u2019s general living conditions. \r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About GDMPC:<\/b>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental.

The main source of income for the business comes from operating a pedicab transport service. Emie has been engaged in her business for over 1 year and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Emie joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Emie has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to repair an existing vehicle for better service. Emie is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP which will be used to purchase tires and other accessories. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Emie from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\n<b>About GDMPC:<\/b>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

All the members will use the loan for different purposes. The group loan leader, Mrs. Vanny C., a 37-year- old mother of three children attending the local school, owns a small store in the local village.

A., who lives in the village of Barangay 2A, Manapla, Negros Occidental, is 40 years old and married to Leo A. who presently works as a fish broker in the \u201cpala-pala\u201d - the wholesale fish market. They have five school-age children. Jocelyn loves her husband and children so much that she want to give them a good future and to help her husband to earn more. She decided to put up a business and have her own source of income.\r\n\r\nBecause of her dream for her family, Jocelyn engaged in selling different breakfast foods in the wet market where her husband works. From this she earned a small income that helped to defray some of their family expenses. She continued her food vending business but she also continued to look at other business opportunities because she believed that expanding to other businesses will help her increase her income. In 2006, she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon to access additional capital which she used to set up a general store near the community basketball court which has high pedestrian traffic.\r\n\r\nJocelyn has been in business for the past six years and now her entrepreneurial activities earn her a monthly income of PHP 12,500. This income goes to support the family's household expenses and the education of her children.\r\n\r\nIn her previous loan, Jocelyn borrowed Php 19,500 which she used as additional capital for her business. For her 10th loan she is proposing to borrow Php 21,000 to be used again as additional capital. Whatever income she gets from this loan will be used for her family and for school expenses.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few, but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":395710,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

O. is a 50-year-old hardworking mother who dreams of helping her husband earn a living for their family to provide a better future for her children. She is married and blessed with four young adult children ranging in age from 18 to 25 years old. The family lives in the village of Rogie, Bi-ao, Binalbagan, Negros Occidental.\r\n\r\nBecause of her strong determination to help her family, Leonisa started selling agricultural products in her community. Even though it only earned her a small income, she was happy to be able to help her husband support their family. As she continued with her business, the idea of putting up a general store came up, but she did not have sufficient capital to expand her business. This is why she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in August of 2000 - so that she could borrow additional capital to execute her plan of setting up a general store and increasing her income potential.\r\n\r\nOver the years, Leonisa\u2019s diligence in paying back her loans on time gave her the opportunity to continue increasing her loan amount at each new cycle. With each new loan, she was able to expand and diversify her business ventures, which included raising livestock. She was able to go into different ventures because her children and her husband were very supportive and were at hand to help her manage the businesses. Her current activities earns her a monthly income of PHP 8,000.\r\n\r\nFor her previous loan she borrowed Php 18,000 which she used fully as additional capital for her businesses and the loan was fully paid on time without any delays. This reinforced her good credit record with NWTF-Project Dungganon.

Mrs. Vong S., 47, has been selected to be a leader. Vong S. is the mother of seven children.  Four are married and live separately and another three are employed as garment workers. Vong S. is married to Heang, 49, who is a local construction worker. \n Since her parents were alive, Vong S. has worked a plot of farming land.

Purevjav and her husband hire a driver and large truck, travel to a nearby forest, collect old wood, and transport it to the province center to sell.

Today, their businesses are very popular among the locals. For the future, Purevjav and her husband hope to start a small ger wall and supplies factory, as he has experience producing these products.

In the plantation, she now faces a problem because her field is not fertile, so she decided to ask for a loan to buy more fertilizer to support the field. She will use the rest of the loan to buy cucumber seeds to grow. Her husband, Mr. Yos Hean, helps her on the farm. Mrs. M. N. does not have any children to help her.\r\n\r\nThree members in this group loan have end-of-term (EoT) loans and the rest have monthly payment loans. Those with EoT loans are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. EoT loans are AMK\u2019s main product because they are the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. EoT loans allow them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to. Most clients start to make their payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time. AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09% and a default rate of 0% on

On this plantation, she now faces a small problem because her field contains infertile soil, which has a bad effect on the crop. To solve this problem, Mrs. Srey Tum H. decided to ask for a loan to buy fertilizers, and she would use a portion of the loan to hire laborers to work in the field. For her silk weaving, she would buy more silk and other raw material to weave for her customers. Mrs. Srey Tum H. is a 31-year-old widow with three children, two of whom are weavers, and the youngest of whom is attending the local school.

He is 32 years old and had to drop school before finishing 5th grade, when his father passed away and he had to start working to help support his family. He lives with his wife and children aged 2, 5 and 6, and all of them go to school.\r\n\r\nHe has never left the city and he works with agriculture and owns a machamba (a large garden where crops are grown that provide most all the food for the people in the villages). He's been working since 1995 and has 3 employees, who work 8 hours a day. He got his work experience from working in a farm prior to that. His favorite vegetable is cabbage, which he grows in a 80km2 (80 square kilometers), and spending up to 35.000,00MT (U$1,275) each harvest, and making back around 65.000,00MT (U$2,365). Adding to that the other cultures, he's able to make up to 85.000,00MT (U$3,100) at the end of each harvest, which allows him to save some money. \r\n\r\nThis is Flavio's 4th loan with Hluvuku in the amount of 23.000,00MT (U$850) to buy agricultural consumables (seeds, fertilizers, soil preparation) and also to pay his employees. He faces tough challenges like plagues, burglary and the lack of transportation for yielding. The other loans were paid in time and were all used for the same purpose. \r\n\r\nIn order to guarantee his children proper food and education, he feels that he needs to keep investing in this business, as it is what he's good at. He plans on taking another loan in the future to buy a car to help with the business.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Mariana Dauwe, Kiva

Besides his kids he also helps a nephew and an aunt by sending them money every month. \r\n\r\nMiguel moved to Maputo in 1960, built his home and started his business. He owns a shop in Mahubo where he works from 8AM to 7PM every day. He worked at a company called \"Manofatos\" prior to that, which is where he acquired all his experience in commerce. His best sellers are rice, salt and oil. By buying the products and reselling them at his shop he's able to make around 2.000,00MT (U$70) per month and is even able to save some. \r\n\r\nThis is his second loan he's asking, in the amount of 10.000,00MT (U$375). He will use the money buy a bigger amount of merchandise and diversify his products, growing his business. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Mariana Dauwe, Kiva
