","en":"Adiba is an intelligent and conscientious young mother and a businesswoman. Her mother helps her run the business. Her husband went to Russia for work but never returned to his home country because he married a woman in Russia. Adiba and her two minor children returned to her parents' home and six months later she divorced her husband. It was hard for Adiba to go through these difficult times.

Part of the credit will be used to purchase five sheep. He will start selling lambs and use the milk from the sheep to produce cheese, which will be sold on nearby town's open market as well.

Two of her older daughters are married and live separately, one daughter is a student at a pedagogical college, and the youngest son attends eighth grade at a local school.  After the fall of the Soviet Union, Baktygul's family received a plot of land, which served as the first investment into their own business.  After working in the farming business until a recent time, Baktygul decided to sell the land and start an animal husbandry business.  She bought calves for fattening up and uses all her efforts to develop her business.  This is why Baktygul went to the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to request a loan in the sum of 50,000 som (KGS) to buy two heifers.

With the new profits from her expanded business, Aba plans to reinvest for further growth.\r\nTo smoke the fish, you need to go to the sea shore to buy fresh fish from the fishermen.  When you come home with the fish, you clean them. Once you drain the water from the fish, the fish will be ready to be smoked. Firewood and a traditionally-built oven are prepared to smoke the fish. The cooking time for the fish varies depending on the size of the fish and their arrangement in the oven. \r\nThe most important thing about this process is that it is the smoke, not the fire, that cooks the fish. The smoke gives the fish its dark color. Green leaves are used as coverings for the fish to prevent the smoke from escaping into the air. The heat should also be moderate as too much heat would not allow the fish to cook properly.\r\nCape Coast is a town in the Central Region of Ghana that is known to be a fishing community.

","en":"Burmakan is 44 years old, a widow and has three children.  Because Burmakan is the only provider for her family, she uses all her efforts to support all of her children's needs.  She started her retail business in 1996.  Having taken out a loan in the sum of 22,000 som (KGS) in 2005, Burmakan chose to focus on sales of children's clothing and repaid that loan in a timely manner and without delays.

Natia works as teacher at a local school. Along with her job, she is actively involved in the family agricultural business. In particular, they have a greenhouse with a total area of 200 sq. meters. In the winter, the family grows onions in the greenhouse, and in the summer, tomatoes. Also, the family grows strawberries on family-owned land and sells them during the summer season. The fruits and vegetables are sold on local market by the family members. The total average monthly income of the family is 1000 Laris. \r\n\r\nNatia requested credit for renovation of the greenhouse.

He will use his Kiva loan to support labor costs during rice production: nursery, transplanting, field management, guarding birds, and later for harvesting activities.\r\n\r\nWith profits from his farming, he wishes to invest in his business so that in the future he can acquire machines and tractors that will enhance his farming capacity.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009).

Today he tries to excel at growing cacao, coffee and citrus fruits.  After harvesting his plants, he brings them to the city of San Francisco to sell.  In San Fransisco, he has various purchasers who are familiar with the quality of his products and are always sure to wait for him to purchase his whole crop.  What Erick likes most about his work is planting his fields and making them fertile and productive.  He has been in this line of work for 6 years and feels that the most difficult part is spraying his parcels of land, which is something he must do very carefully so that the chemicals don't damage his health.  In the future, he hopes to keep saving his earnings so he can purchase additional land.  This is Erick's second loan with MFP, and he hopes each one of you can help him, as he knows the money he will be loaned will be very beneficial in the progress of his labor.

They are in their first loan cycle.  Also, as 'Alfa' means the beginning of something, they gave their group this name.  The group has three members: Ana Carina, Edgar and Amelia.  Each of them has requested their loan for different purposes.  Edgar is the group's representative and he will invest his loan in buying a copier, three consumables and paper for printing different sizes such as letter and legal.  He tells us that he is 27 years old and has been married to Amelia for 7 years.  The couple have two children: one is 12 years old and in middle school, and their youngest is 6 years old and in elementary school.\r\n\r\nEdgar started his business (an Internet cafe) as his children's school expenses are very high.  He has had this business for three years.  He didn't have a stable place for his business but one year ago he finally managed to set up his premises.  His Internet cafe still doesn't have a name and he will continue looking for one.  Up to now, he hasn't had any problems with his business, only when his profits fall which usually happens during the holiday period.  However, he is now getting used to this.  He says that it is normal and therefore it doesn't worry him.  One of Edgar's goals is to be able to lower his prices so that he can attract more customers.\r\n\r\nAmelia requested her loan to buy a printer and toner for her business which is also an Internet cafe.  Ana Carina has requested her loan to buy Fuller-brand cosmetics such as creams, perfumes, etc.  In general, the group is very happy and they are grateful to FRAC for their sincere understanding in supporting them and giving them this loan which they need so badly."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":862426,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Internet Cafe","sector":"Services","use":"to buy a copier, consumables and printing paper","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-09-20T00:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana Carina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edgar ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amelia Edith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":11000,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1265.69},{"due_date":"2011-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1295.48},{"due_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1325.97},{"due_date":"2011-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1357.17},{"due_date":"2011-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1389.12},{"due_date":"2011-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1421.81},{"due_date":"2011-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1455.27},{"due_date":"2011-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1489.49}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.68},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.05},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.47},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.96},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.5},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":113.1},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":115.76},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.48}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":309.2,"local_amount":3887.14,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:12:16Z","rounded_local_amount":3997.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232807742,"comment":null},{"amount":218.46,"local_amount":2746.29,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:22:42Z","rounded_local_amount":2823.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238618842,"comment":null},{"amount":228.86,"local_amount":2877.08,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:04:11Z","rounded_local_amount":2958.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244573082,"comment":null},{"amount":118.48,"local_amount":1489.49,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:12:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1531.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250784792,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-09-21T15:33:04Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T10:12:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":336882,"name":"Grace","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Grace is married to a farmer and they both live together with their six dependants in Abura.

She offers her customers tamales, atole, tlacoyos, fried tacos, rice tacos, pozole, enchiladas and stews. \r\n\r\nHer business is important because she has her own business and earns money to help with the family's expenses. Her business also allows her to share with her children when there is a need. She likes to prepare the food and, with a kind and friendly smile, serve her customers. She feels proud when the customers return for more food because they comment that it is delicious. Her business is well-known for the tamales and the fried tacos. The customers come and put in their orders for tamales and golden tacos. When there are large orders she hires two or three women who help her prepare the tamales. She uses the earnings to invest once again in the supplies for continuing to sell prepared food. She is planning to put a roof over her patio and buy chairs and tables so her business will look nicer. She plans to achieve her goal by working with enthusiasm and through the loans.

She is married with five children. Syrga and her family breed cattle and sell agricultural products. Syrga started this business fifteen years ago when she bought a cow for the money she had saved. She managed to grow her business; now she owns six heads of cattle. The profits from this business helped Syrga provide her children with good dowry and contribute to her children's households.  The family's monthly profits from the sales of meat and dairy products range between 5,000 and 6,000 Kyrgyz som. In order to expand her business, Syrga turned to Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan of 135,000 Kyrgyz som. She is planning to use the loan for buying more cattle and to use the profits for expanding her business by increasing the number of cattle. In the future, she will use the money for her son's marriages and her daughter's dowry.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":873086,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Achy village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2011-09-16T07:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Syrga","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":135000,"loan_amount":3000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":35000},{"due_date":"2012-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":777.78},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2222.22}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2011-09-25T00:51:24Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}}]}
