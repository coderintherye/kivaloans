She did not have the opportunity to go to school and she is a widow. She currently lives alone because her children are already married. Miss Epifania tells us that since she was little, her parents taught her to work and thanks to this, she has gotten ahead in life with her family. She currently has a small soft drink store in her house and earns some money from it. She sells to her friends and neighbors. She says that now that she has been selling her products for many years and is well known in her neighborhood, thanks to God, she sells a lot. She always has music playing in her business and she believes that this attracts her customers. She will invest this loan in the purchase of a variety of soft drinks to revive her business. She wants to continue growing her business and increasing sales so that she can have a better quality of life. \r\n\r\nThis group really appreciates the trust and support that the foundation has given them."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1044536,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","use":"purchase soft drinks","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Tetela, Oaxaca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-03-23T05:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-22T05:00:04Z","loan_amount":2450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zacarias ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Epifania","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ines ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ismael ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Guadalupe ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Esmeralda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hilaria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yolanda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Virginia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":31000,"loan_amount":2450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3100},{"due_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":3100},{"due_date":"2012-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":3100},{"due_date":"2012-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3100},{"due_date":"2012-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":3100},{"due_date":"2012-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3100},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":3100},{"due_date":"2012-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3100},{"due_date":"2012-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":3100},{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":245},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":245},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":245},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":245},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":245},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":245},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":245},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":245},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":245},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":245}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-03-23T10:44:09Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":405694,"name":"Mlongo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mlongo is a 53-year-old woman.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses\r\n\r\nLuzvilla oversees operations of their tricycle transportation business. They have one tricycle unit that carries up to four passengers to their destination within the community; the tricycle driver then remits a boundary (daily quota) each day to her. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 700 Philippines pesos (Php) every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php8,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy spare parts and for the maintenance of her tricycle unit. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nLuzvilla dreams to be able to buy another tricycle soon. She also dreams that her children will finish their education.

She works around 58 hours a week in her business and she believes that it is doing well because she sells very nice, good-quality products.\r\n\r\nGladys is very grateful to Kiva lenders because, with the help that they give her, she will be able to buy grapes wholesale which will enable her to make her products.  With this improvement, she will be able to make more wine and have more merchandise to offer her customers.  This will allow her to improve her quality of life and her income.  In this way, she will continue working hard every day toward her biggest goal: \"to have a wine-making factory\"."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1044575,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy grapes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ica","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2012-03-23T11:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-22T11:30:02Z","loan_amount":1125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gladys Luisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":196.26},{"due_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":213.91},{"due_date":"2012-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":218.39},{"due_date":"2012-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":229.23},{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":234.77},{"due_date":"2012-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":243.37},{"due_date":"2012-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":254.28},{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":261.59},{"due_date":"2012-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":272.55},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":281.15},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":291.45},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":303.05}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.6},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.21},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.9},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.96},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.04},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.26},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.36},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":98.1},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.2},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.43},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.3},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.64}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-03-23T23:50:13Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":406014,"name":"Joel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Joel is married with two children.

Most people who live here work as merchants or farmers, or they raise animals.  These individuals have been with their communal bank for 3 loan cycles, and they are very pleased with the help that they have been getting from the institution.\r\n\r\nIn this place we meet Rosa, who is 50 years old.  Her husband died a number of years ago and left her alone with their 6 children.  Now 4 of these children are adults, while the other two, aged 13 and 15, are in school.  Three of her children still live with her.\r\n\r\nIn order to make a living, and to meet the needs of her children, Rosa has worked for many years in her parish church, doing chores such as cleaning and other activities.  But, as this did not generate enough income to cover her household expenses and the expenses of raising her children, a friend motivated her to start to sell clothing.  Now, she shares her time between working at the church and selling clothing, which she does in the evenings and nights.  Rosa has been selling clothing for 2 years, and this business is going very well.\r\n\r\nRosa will use this loan to buy more merchandise such as: pants, blouses, T-shirts and children's clothing.  This is her 3rd loan cycle in the communal bank, and she likes it because the loans have been a great help to her with her business.\r\n\r\nRosa's dream is for her children to have everything they need.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1044621,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy pants, blouses, T-shirts and children's clothing\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"24 de Mayo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2012-03-23T15:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-22T15:30:02Z","loan_amount":4350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa Angelica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Herminia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Santa Mariana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dagny Yalile","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jenny Jes\u00fas","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nancy Auxiliadora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yisela Mar\u00eda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Celeste Zoraida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eduvije Del Pilar","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucy Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Marlene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gustavo Adolfo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Betty Amira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Vicenta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wagner Javier","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":4345,"loan_amount":4350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":434.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":434.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":434.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":434.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":434.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":434.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":434.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":434.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":434.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":434.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":435},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":435},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":435},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":435},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":435},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":435},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":435},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":435},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":435},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":435}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-03-23T22:14:43Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":406072,"name":"Elizabeth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elizabeth is 33 years old, separated, and has three children.

When developing this solution, he focused his attention on creating an all-purpose wash that could be used for all vehicles and had the environment in mind.

is Cecilla, 63, resident of Dasmarinas, Cavite City, Philippines. Her husband is Leandro, her business partner. She together with her husband manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nCecilla operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings where all of the family members are at home to take part of the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands cost less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php1000 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php20, 000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings, and frozen food products. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nCecilla dreams to grow her business and secure her future.

is Emma, 34, a resident of Baseco, Manila, Philippines. She is married to Alex, her business partner, and a mother to their children. She, together with her husband, manages their own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nEmma operates a business where she sells watches and cell phones. She buys them at wholesale prices and sells them for a small profit. Customers are attracted to buy due to the low selling prices. Aside from her retail business she also earns an income through her tap water refilling station. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 3,000 PHP in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a 35,000 PHP loan. She will utilize the loan to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nEmma dreams to be able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business.

So, with the income, he bought a store and set up an aluminum workshop in a strategic area. \r\n\r\nHis business has gradually grown, thanks to his great work capacity, discipline, and responsibility. He is able to attract his customers because he is a professional at making different shapes of windows in aluminum.  Presently he is applying for a loan of 100,000 YER from AMB to buy varied items of aluminum which will allow him to expand his business. His investment will be successful because he has a lot of experience.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Mansour hopes to expand his business to have another aluminum workshop in order to improve his living conditions. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1050066,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Metal Shop","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"to buy varied items of aluminum which will allow him to expand his business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"YE","country":"Yemen","town":"Taiz","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15.5 47.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":205,"posted_date":"2012-03-23T21:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-22T21:30:02Z","loan_amount":475,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mansour","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"YER","disbursal_amount":100000,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":10072},{"due_date":"2012-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":9992},{"due_date":"2012-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":9992},{"due_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":9992},{"due_date":"2012-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":9992},{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":9992},{"due_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":9992},{"due_date":"2012-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":9992},{"due_date":"2012-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":9992},{"due_date":"2013-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":9992}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.84},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.46},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.47},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.46},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.46},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.46},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.46},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.47},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.46},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.46}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-03-24T07:24:22Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":406285,"name":"Madina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Madina lives in Kampala, Uganda.

In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings where all of the family members are at home to take part of the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but also a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands cost less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 1,000 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nPatricia hopes to grow her business and dreams of being able to give her family a good future through all her hard work in her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n * All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

On this occasion, her goal for this new loan is to invest in a variety of products such as rice, beans, cooking oil, charcoal, corn, toilet paper, and toothpaste, among other items. These will help her to increase her sales and her earnings, and also to increase her number of customers. For the future, her hope is to expand her business so it is more solid, and offer her family members better living conditions. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1045718,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy a variety of products for her store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2012-03-24T01:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-23T01:40:02Z","loan_amount":450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria De Los Santos","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":10000,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-03-29T21:53:36Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":406461,"name":"Sylvia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sylvia lives in Kampala, Uganda.
