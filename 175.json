Her eldest son is 25 years old and in his fourth year of college, her other son is 23 years old and in his third year of college, her daughter is 22 years old and in her first year of college, while her youngest daughter is 9 years old and in fifth grade. Her goal is to produce greater quantities of materials to meet customer demand. She would like to improve the quality of her products so that she can increase sales since her customers will be satisfied with the products she makes. She would also like to obtain more updated machinery to make construction materials and guarantee financial stability to her family, providing her youngest child with a better future. <p>\r\nMs. Rodr\u00edguez sells construction materials for a living. Her business is located 2 blocks west, 1 block south of the Guadalupe church. She has been in business for 12 years. She started the business because of her father, who used to be in charge. However, when her father became ill, she took over. At first, it was very difficult for her because she did not have any business management skills, so she had to research information about this type of business because she needed to make an honest living to support her family. Also, her father wanted the business to be kept in the family, which is why she is trying so hard not to let her family down. Thus, she has managed to expand the business by hiring new workers and producing more construction materials. This loan will be used as business capital to purchase raw materials to make cinder blocks, bricks and decorative bricks. She will also invest the money in sand and iron sales.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Elizabeth Casian, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":265514,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction Supplies","sector":"Construction","use":"Business capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-02-05T01:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Silvia Elena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":10000,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2009-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2009-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2009-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:42:05Z","rounded_local_amount":2618.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20400046,"comment":null},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2009-03-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:37:08Z","rounded_local_amount":2618.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27092044,"comment":null},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:40:25Z","rounded_local_amount":2618.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35985427,"comment":null},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2009-05-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:11:17Z","rounded_local_amount":2618.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44446042,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-02-05T06:55:06Z","paid_date":"2009-06-15T23:11:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":87186,"name":"Luciola Doris","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"LUCIOLA DORIAS D.

Grace lives with her husband in his rented apartment with the children.

She sells rice with stew, which is mostly purchased by the traders. Her food is very moderate and also tastes good attracting lots of customers to buy from her table. In addition to that she also prepares and sells pastries also at the road side.  \r\n\r\nGrace wants the loan to buy more bags of raw materials like rice, meat, charcoal, flour, and margarine, among others. She is convinced the loan would help her increased her stock, and in the event of a price hike she would be better resourced to cook food and fried pastries. Grace says the proceeds will be used to supports her kids in their education. She says she would be grateful for your assistance. Grace belongs to a village bank called \u2018Okyeso Nyame\u2019 which means Almighty God. She also hope to receive GH\u00a21000 to make business progress by restocking her inventory.

His wife works for a company called Arnecom.\r\n\r\nHis goals are to run an excellent business, as there are many people who wish to enter into his field of work but who don't know much about good management. His dreams are to build a better life for his family and overcome their current situation, which is more challenging each day as he is responsible for providing his daughters with everything they need. He also dreams of owning his own home, as his family currently lives with his mother-in-law. He would then be able to leave the house to his daughters in the future.\r\n\r\nHe works selling a range of goods including shorts, shirts, underwear and trousers. He has run this business for three years. He started out in a different line of work in a bookstore, however his salary was very low and he wanted another source of income. He decided to invest some of his capital in a new business, and started out selling his merchandise on the weekends, as he worked in the bookstore during the week. His customers became his friends, and later he made more friends who placed orders for his products. His wife assisted him in distributing merchandise, making sales both on credit and for cash. In such a way he has been able to bring in a little more income.\r\n\r\nThe loan is for working capital, which he will use to buy better quality clothing. He would also like to purchase cosmetics.

Luis has three children.  His eldest son is 14 years old and is a sophmore in high school, his other son is 13 years old and a freshmen, and his youngest son is 10 and in the sixth grade.  His partner is self-employed.  His goals are to invest more in his business (most of his customers are children.)  Don Luis wants to guarantee economic stability for his children as the recent situation is very difficult. He is a person who has always worked hard to earn a living, doing whatever is necessary to earn his daily bread.  Don Luis's dreams are to improve his family's quality of life because he doesn't want to see his children go without necessities.  In this way they wouldn't have economic problems and his children would be able to get a better education.  He would like his children to study abroad since education is very good and his children would take advantage of the opportunity to study.\r\n\r\nDon Luis earns a living by providing video game service.  It's located where the billiards were 3 1\/2 to the east.  He's been in business for three years.  Don Luis started this because he was out of work and found himself in the shameful position of his wife paying the bills.  This is the reason he decided to establish a business that will generate income for his family.  He decided to establish video game service for his neighbors, who are mostly children.  It was very helpful that his children played [video games].  This helped him learn how to operate video games much faster as well as learning what his customers were asking for.  This began as a search for TVs and he got it with the help of his family who supported him and his idea.  He began with two TVs, so his customers had to wait until time was up before they could begin playing.  With the little bit he has earned, he has been able to buy two more TVs and supply the huge demand.  In this way that he has been able to stay in this business that he also enjoys.  The funding is for working capital to invest in buying equipment and discs to provide better service to his customers.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Shelly Hubman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":266066,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchase discs and equipement","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-02-10T19:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luis Andres","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":9000,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2009-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:42:15Z","rounded_local_amount":750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20400051,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2009-03-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:37:02Z","rounded_local_amount":750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27092049,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:40:20Z","rounded_local_amount":750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35985432,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2009-05-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:11:15Z","rounded_local_amount":750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44446047,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2009-06-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:40:54Z","rounded_local_amount":750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52956684,"comment":null},{"amount":262.5,"local_amount":5250,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T14:00:57Z","rounded_local_amount":5250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63174107,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

Young Hect\u00f3r has a 5-year old son who attends primary school in the 2nd grade. His wife does domestic work but does not have a job. His goals are to maintain his customer base, since they make his success and growth possible, and to offer them essential services. His dreams are to strengthen his business to the point of having better coverage, since his customers seek the best technology offered and, furthermore, not all their needs are met. His wishes are to increase his Internet capabilities because he has limited equipment, and his customers leave for lack of equipment. He does not have sufficient space for the installation of more equipment with which he could bring in a better income for his family and pay his contracted debts with the institution.\r\n<p>\r\nH\u00e9ctor works in Internet services. The location of his business is a half block north of Dilectus. He has run his business for three years. H\u00e9ctor started his business because it was his dream, along with his bigger dream to become independent with his business. He started off by making acquaintances with others who have experience in the business. One of his friends offered him the opportunity to work in his Internet caf\u00e9 while saving what he could of his pay, and little by little he earned enough to buy a computer. He then bought another computer from a friend at a good price because, to obtain three computers later on, he would sell him another. Starting off with two computers was very difficult because the cost of each computer was high, but seeing that the profits from his Internet caf\u00e9 were very low, he acquired another computer to make three computers. He decided to look into loan options to pay off outstanding accounts. Since this time he has worked with the Fundaci\u00f3n Le\u00f3n 2000. Now he is requesting a loan to invest in his business. He would like to add Internet accessories and improve his equipment and the resolution of his programs. He would be pleased to work with the Fundaci\u00f3n Le\u00f3n 2000, and the organizations that contribute to its cause, to be able to make this investment.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Rebecca Towle, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":266077,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Internet Cafe","sector":"Services","use":"Business Investment","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-02-10T19:10:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hector Rafael","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":12000,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:42:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20400052,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-03-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:37:06Z","rounded_local_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27092050,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:40:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35985433,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-05-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:11:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44446048,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-06-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:40:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52956685,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-07-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-05T09:31:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":66055583,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-08-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T15:31:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73599716,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T17:58:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87035607,"comment":null},{"amount":200,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T21:43:48Z","rounded_local_amount":4000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96948011,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

However, no matter how hard the economic situation is, Juan must meet his responsibility to put food on the table for his family each and every day. \r\n<p>\r\nDon Juan works by selling food staples like rice, oil, beans, sugar and soups.  His business is located in the Central Market and he has owned his business for the past 12 years.  Don Juan started his business for his wife with the objective that he would be able to help her to support the family.  He decided to establish his business in the market even though it was very difficult to get the space.  A friend was able to help him to secure the space and little by little he began to sell products like rice and beans, since he did not have enough money to stock his space with more merchandise.  As he began saving up his profits, his was able to buy and sell more products like oil, sugar and oatmeal.  As time has gone by, Juan has been able to achieve his goal of making money to support his family.  The financing that Juan is requesting is so that he can invest capital in his business since he needs to buy more products for the his customers  that need basic grains.\r\n<br

In 1999, Mrs. H\u1ed3ng became a member of the TYM Fund and used a loan to start a small retail enterprise selling miscellaneous items.  Today, after participating in the Fund for ten years, she has become the owner of a grocery shop located beside her town\u2019s open-air market.  Currently, her husband receives a small retirement pension, which supplements the family\u2019s earnings from the shop, so that their financial situation is steadily improving.  Their total income is about 4,500,000 VND (270 USD) per month.  In the next lending cycle, Mrs. H\u1ed3ng hopes to borrow 12,000,000 VND (725 USD) to increase her inventory of groceries, sweet cakes, and candy, in order to meet the needs of her customers during

Her husband works as a driver.  Before she became a member of the TYM Fund, the financial situation of her family was very difficult because their income depended solely on her husband\u2019s wages.  In 2005, she joined the Fund and used a loan to invest in a grocery shop.  Today, with an income of 4,000,000 VND (240 USD) per month, her family\u2019s standard of living is steadily improving.  In the next lending cycle, Mrs. Huy\u1ec1n hopes to borrow 10,000,000 VND (600 USD) to increase the inventory of her grocery shop.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by Robert Sides, Kiva

Before she became a member of the TYM Fund, her family\u2019s income came mainly from collecting scrap materials.  In 1998, she joined the Fund and used a loan to start a small grocery shop and a fish farming enterprise.  The operations have thrived and now provide her family with a steady income.  Currently, in addition to the family businesses selling groceries and raising fish, her husband also earns wages working in a bronze casting business.  The family income averages about 4,000,000 VND (240 USD) per month.  In the next lending cycle, she hopes to borrow 15,000,000 VND (900 USD) to invest in her grocery shop and to buy fish to stock her fish farming operation.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese

She has faced many challenges in life such as the death of so many members of her family, inadequate funds to sustain her business project, and ill health. These challenges made life uncomfortable for her, until December 12th 1999 when she discovered GHAPE and became a member. In that same year, Julia received her first loan of 15,000 FRS and her repayment was successful.

She will start repayment  from the fourth month after loan disbursement.  She is convinced that she will succeed because she already has a fertile piece of farmland where she will carry out her farming. And she already has experience in the activity. With the profit from the business, she plans to pay her children's school fees, using part to expand her business.

They buy their fish along the Niger river, more precisely at Kirango; their rice comes from Dougabougou and Markala, and their millet from the weekly fair at Diamarabougou and the market at Kirango. These products are sold out of their houses, or door-to-door and in the markets of Kirango and Diamarabougou (Markala) to a clientele composed of women and men. At the same time, they act as intermediaries between suppliers and buyers who come from afar, which makes a supplementary income to add to their working capital. <P>\r\n\r\nThey hope to make a monthly average profit of 35,000 F CFA which will be used to make repayments on the loan, to buy medicines, pay school fees for their children and pay their contributions to their communal association. Their wish is to increase their working capital which will allow them to put aside savings so as to build a house. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":266352,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"purchase of fish and cereals for re-sale ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Segou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14 -6","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-03-02T17:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mahawa                     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aminata                ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa                         ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sitan           ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Oumou         ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fanta              ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":450000,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2009-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":75000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":300,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:11:31Z","rounded_local_amount":151245.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135805,"comment":null},{"amount":150,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:33:58Z","rounded_local_amount":75622.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033606,"comment":null},{"amount":150,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:42:39Z","rounded_local_amount":75622.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44620974,"comment":null},{"amount":150,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2009-06-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:24:39Z","rounded_local_amount":75622.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53019939,"comment":null},{"amount":150,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:22:25Z","rounded_local_amount":75622.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242684,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-03-03T19:12:04Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T19:22:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":87439,"name":"Chan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Chan N. is 53 years old and lives with his wife in Moung Ruessei, Battambang province.

They are on their fifth group loan after having repaid the preceding four without difficulty.  This new loan will be used to buy 200 sacks of charcoal and 22 cart loads of firewood.  Supplies of charcoal are gotten in the villages of Togo, Konodimini, and Sakebougou.  Sometimes the suppliers come and deliver to them locally.

They are all married women and live in monogamous families in the village of Sebougou, S\u00e9gou prefecture (fourth administrative region of the Republic of Mali).  The group members know one another through ties of marriage and community and are all members of the traditional mutual aid association of the Bobo ethnicity of Sebougou.  \r\n\r\nThe need to work to earn an income has brought them to seek support;  and so, they were informed by the Djamadjigui association of Sebougou regarding the work that Soro Yiriwaso is doing with women.  In this way, the women joined its loan program and are now on their first loan in the amount of 250,000 francs CFA.  This money will be used to buy 25 cart loads of firewood, 20 boxes of Hypo brand soap, and a sack of locally-made soap.  Supplies of firewood are continually gotten at home from producers;  and the soap is gotten at the weekly fairs in the city of S\u00e9gou.  The firewood is split into pieces and sold in piles at home, cash or credit accepted, to customers composed for the most part of women.  As for the soap, it is sold by the piece door-to-door in the district, for cash and sometimes on credit payable the same day.  \r\n<p>\r\nThe group members envision realizing an average monthly profit of 66,670 francs CFA that will be used to pay the loan interest, to save some money, and to buy wedding items and accessories for their children.  Their objective is to have a cart and donkey that will enable them to generate more resources.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":266379,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy firewood and soap ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Segou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14 -6","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-03-01T08:00:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kanou                 ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sogoni          ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Collette     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata     Y.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamou     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":250000,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":83333.34,"processed_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:11:28Z","rounded_local_amount":84025.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135808,"comment":null},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:33:53Z","rounded_local_amount":42012.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033609,"comment":null},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:42:35Z","rounded_local_amount":42012.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44620977,"comment":null},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:24:21Z","rounded_local_amount":42012.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53019942,"comment":null},{"amount":83.34,"local_amount":41666.65,"processed_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:22:19Z","rounded_local_amount":42012.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242687,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-03-01T15:58:44Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T19:22:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":87453,"name":"Houssein","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p>Houssein is a 25-year-old man who lives in Tyre in southern Lebanon with his wife.

S. is 51 years old. He is married and has 5 children. Yakub is a hard-working man who has fought to provide for his family and educate his children. Today his children are working adults thanks to his example. Only his younger son is still under his care. Yakub has great experience cattle breeding; he has worked with cattle since 1988. Over time, he has increased his sales. Now he needs assistance investing in his business. The business has been going well and he would like it to continue to grow. Yakub applied for a loan of $800 USD to buy young cattle. He and his family thank you very much for the support that you offer them in continuing this business and helping them give their children a better quality of life.\r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history. Its history includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and many famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets like Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, Western culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Its history includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and many famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets like Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, Western culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She has been working in her \"buyam sellam\" business for a number of years now and has since found the items she sells from suppliers; this ensures she gets the best prices on these items. Evonne now has many customers who come to her for all of their vegetables. She allows some people to create tabs with her for their purchases and pay her at the end of the month. Her contribution to her community provides them with these items in closer proximity to their community, cutting down on their travel costs and the time involved in searching for these items.\r\n \r\nWith the profits from this loan, Evonne plans to send her children to school and support them after school. She will also consider adding other food stuffs to her stall.

GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach. Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values. Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement. GHAPE instils a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.  \r\n \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":266470,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"To buy more inventory for her food stall","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Ntarikon, Bamenda, NW.

As many of the roads are in shambles, bikes are often able to move through these areas quicker and without suffering as much damage as cars. <P>\r\n\r\nWith the profit from this loan, Charles plans to take care of his family, ensure that they eat well and buy their medications.  He knows very well that he will be able to repay this loan because of the low interest rate and the lengthy repayment period.

del Socorro E. is 38 years old.  She is married and has one son who is ten year old.  Her son is in the third grade and her husband works as a livestock farmer. Her goal is to increase her income and to be able to overcome the difficult economic situation in her country.  Her dream is to be able to give her family a more stable life, since there are many problems in her family and she wishes that some day everyone will be able to live in the same home.Her dream is also to improve the quality of life for her family since everyone depends on her to pay for the costs of supporting the family.  Her husband helps the family as much as he can.  She really wishes the best for her son and hopes that he will become an honorable member of the community.\r\n\r\nMrs. Maria's main economic activity is selling general merchandise. She is a traveling salesperson. She has had her business for the past nine years. She decided to start her business because she needed to find a way to provide for her family.  She began by selling all types of clothing, but she didn't have the funds to buy enough items to sell, so she started by selling a few clothing items like underwear, jeans, and shirts for teens. She started selling to her neighbors and friends, but then moved on to markets where she was able to find more costumers. Everyday she works hard to obtain more merchandise to sell because she liked making a living this way.  Now she wants to increase her inventory of merchandise even more because her clothing is in high demand. She wants this loan to be able to buy cosmetics, children's clothes, shirts for teens, men's jeans and other products that she can sell.  She will travel to Managua where she can purchase the items at the lowest cost.

S. lives with his wife and two children. He is 50 years old. He dedicates himself primarily to the raising of milk-producing cattle, which his wife sells at the local market and in the local community. He also works part-time as a taxi driver, so he can increase the family income. Karimbobo is requesting a loan in order to purchase high-breed cattle, which will increase the supply of milk his herd produces. This will be his third loan from IMON International; his credit history makes him eligible to receive new and larger loans. With your support, Karimbobo will continue to progress.\r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history. Its history includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and many famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets like Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, Western culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

N. is 50 years old.

He raises them with the help of his wife and children and then sells the adult cows and bulls to local butchers. \r\n<p>\r\nToday, Savridin is thinking about expanding his business, since the income from his present herd isn't enough to provide for his family.

Anorkhon runs a confectionery where she sells candies, cookies and pastries. The income she generates helps her support her family.

Its history includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and many famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets like Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, Western culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BCE.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is the poorest of the former Soviet republics. When the nation declared independence from the U.S.S.R., a civil war ignited and further damaged an already weakened economy. 93% of the country is mountainous, and only 7% of the land is arable. These difficult conditions have resulted in high levels on unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, such as Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

T. operates a vegetable vending business in her rural village at Cabisera 14-16 Ilagan, Isabela. She roams around the village to sell different kinds of vegetables. With the business, Amelia is able to generate an income of PHP750 weekly. She is thankful that through it, she is able to help her husband with their financial and basic needs. She hopes to develop her vending business into a more organized and stable source of income by perseverance. Thus, Amelia is requesting a loan amounting to PHP5,000.00 to be used in venturing into this type of business. \r\n\r\nShe is a person who is willing to extend help to others when necessary and depends on her own capabilities. Amelia is 32 years old and married to Rodolfo T., who assists her in the business by planting different kinds of vegetables, which she will later sell. They were blessed with two children: Rose Ann Jelly, 12; and Hazel Joy, 9. Both are in the primary level of education in a public school situated in their village. Amelia is hoping that someday, despite their poor living conditions, they will be able to support their children\u2019s education through their business.

Besides that, they also sell outfits for children. They have experience in producing peanut butter and in selling clothing. <P>\r\n\r\nWith the intention of expanding their businesses, the members decided to join the loan program of Soro Yiriwaso. The Benkadi group is on their very first solidarity loan (group loan). This loan will be used to buy sacks of peanuts and clothing for children that will be re-sold at the market or door-to-door.

M., 33, is married and the mother of 2 children.  Her older son is 8 years old and just started the 5th grade and her younger son is 5 years old and in the 2nd grade.  Her husband is a laborer.  Her purpose is to grow her business with the goal of maintaining the work that has given her great pleasure.  She needs her own business because her family needs the income from it.  She can't rest because if she doesn't take care of the business she won't be able to provide her children with the things that they need. She hopes that people in other countries will help Nicaraguans because Nicaragua is a very poor country and the interest that people in industrialized countries show in helping the people there is a very good thing.\r\n<p>\r\nMaxima operates a business selling cosmetics and clothing.  There's no fixed address for the business.  She's operated it for 3 years.  Even though Maxima works for the Ministry of Education, her income there isn't enough to cover the family's expenses and, consequently, she decided to sell cosmetics with some friends at work.  She also sells her products at the houses of friends.  She didn't have much sales experience when she started but, as it turned out, the experience she'd gained teaching her students was very much like what she needed for selling.

They have experience in making peanut butter and in selling condiments. <P>\r\n\r\nWishing to expand their businesses, the members decided to join the loan program of Soro Yiriwaso about two years ago.

They generally sell retail and for cash to a clientele constituted of women.<P>\r\n\r\nWith this new loan, they each expect to make on average 110,000 CFA in profit in the course of this loan cycle. This profit will be used to reimburse the loan and cover current household expenses. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1575,"image":{"id":267109,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"purchase of peanuts and condiments for re-sale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"KOUTIALA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.383333 -5.466667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-03-02T17:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Oumou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mama ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Binta    ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadia  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Assata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bintou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Afou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djen\u00e8ba ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":800000,"loan_amount":1575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":262.5,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2009-03-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:07:26Z","rounded_local_amount":133956.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135816,"comment":null},{"amount":262.5,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:12:23Z","rounded_local_amount":133956.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135817,"comment":null},{"amount":262.49,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:34:54Z","rounded_local_amount":133956.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033616,"comment":null},{"amount":262.5,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2009-05-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:43:55Z","rounded_local_amount":133956.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44620984,"comment":null},{"amount":262.5,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2009-06-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:26:26Z","rounded_local_amount":133956.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53019949,"comment":null},{"amount":262.51,"local_amount":133333.35,"processed_date":"2009-07-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:23:29Z","rounded_local_amount":133956.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242694,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-03-04T17:44:48Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T19:23:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}}]}
