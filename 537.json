S. started Black Diamond Services in May 2005. Black Diamond Services sells and maintains custom computer control systems that enable customers to operate household equipment through automated systems. For example, customers could operate their outdoor lighting or security cameras through computer systems. These automated systems also enable customers to access this equipment from outside their homes. Black Diamond Services specializes in customizing the features of these automated control systems to a customer\u2019s needs and specifications. \r\n\r\nCharles employs between 2-10 part-time employees, the number depending on the contracts available. He is married with three children. Charles began his business in response to customer requests for high quality and good customer service. This led him to believe that if he sold quality products, backed them up with superior customer service, and paid attention to customers\u2019 needs, then customers would be willing to pay a premium price for a premium product and service. Charles believes that his business has been successful because of how well he has done in these areas. That 99.9% of his new customers were referred by existing customers is testament to that. \r\n\r\nThis loan helped Charles to purchase new computer control equipment so he could expand his offerings of automated control systems. It is also his third loan and the loans have helped him purchase new equipment and tools as well as increase sales. It is very important that Charles expands his business because he has seen an increased demand for his services from new customers. Without the loans, he would not have been able to expand quickly enough and would have lost those new customers.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":6150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2139.39,"image":{"id":702097,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Computers","sector":"Services","use":"New

It's composed of 5 members who they know well and are neighbors. The members are Margarita who will buy oil, soft drinks, sugar, etc., to supply her grocery store; Maribel who will buy shoes to fill orders; the young Santiago who will buy soft drinks by the case to begin his business; and Maricela who will buy catalogs to fill her first requests and begin her catalog sales business. \r\n\r\nThe young Maribel, who is 33 years old, studied up to the 3rd year of secondary and has her diploma. She is married and her husband works in the countryside, renting land and sowing onions. They have 2 children; Ismael is 11 years old and in the 6th grade in primary school, and Juaquin who is 4 years old. Maribel sells shoes, cosmetics, and lingerie by catalog. She is requesting a loan to buy shoes so she can fill shoe orders. She offers her customers shoes, clothing, cosmetics, and lingerie. \r\n\r\nWhen the business began some 2 years ago, initially, she helped her sister-in-law with sales. Later, Maribel bought catalogs and began to sell. Maribel began cautiously, with a selection she was offered and an initial loan. Her business is mobile; she goes from house to house, offering her products.  Keeping her business is important and special because if she wants some shoes for herself or her children, she provides them cheaper and con provide a discount.  Her favorite part of the business is when the customers pay! Some pay all in cash, others pay half down. Men are the best at paying. She remembers being awarded a packet of lingerie for having good sales each month. She has many customers: men, women, and girls. When there are closing ceremonies and parades, they buy more shoes. Their desire to have the same model makes her business popular; her brand is well-recognized. \r\n\r\nThe challenge that faces her business is that she offers shoes on payments and some people don't pay. The competition her business confronts is that many girls and women who sell from catalogs sell other brands. Maribel invests her earnings to buy more shoes; she plans to expand her business by providing cosmetics, lengerie, chothes, as well as shoes, and she hopes to do this with loans.\r\n\r\nHer business has helped her family when her husband couldn't provide income. From the earnings, she provides food and expenses. She wants to make improvements to her house, mainly the baths and building another bedroom.

For more than 20 years, Luz has prepared and sold fast food such as empanadas, pastel de choclo (a traditional baked fresh ground corn and meat pie), Chilean kneaded bread, berlines (custard-filled pastries), ice cream and drinks from her home. She also makes deliveries.  When Luz first started her business, she only sold bread baked in a wood-fired oven. Now, thanks to Fondo Esperanza and another microfinance institution she used to participated in, Luz has equipment that makes her work easier such as an industrial oven, freezer, electric mixer, and bread pans, among other things.\r\n\r\nLuz has many loyal customers. On Fridays she sells lunches at the office where her oldest child works, and from March to December she sells berlines at various schools. In addition, she has lunch orders to prepare every weekend. With this loan Luz will fix her stove and buy materials and ingredients to cook her food products.\r\n\r\nShe lives with her husband and 3 children. All her children are older and working; none have married yet. On days when they aren't working, Luz's children help her with her cooking and deliveries. \r\n\r\nLuz's dream is to have a bakery and store front right in her home. The loans from Fondo Esperanza have helped her business greatly, especially when her sales were low. Luz also enjoys the support of her group members and business guidance she receives from her Fondo Esperanza advisor. \r\n\r\nSan Bernardo is a city located 28 km directly south of la plaza de armas in Santiago, the capital of Chile. It's known as the folklore capital of Chile because of the International Festival of Folklore held there every January. At the festival the country's traditions are highlighted and musical groups from all over South America gather. San Bernardo also holds the Festival of Traditional Crafts, attended equally by Chilean artisans and artisans from nearby countries. In April, there is \"Abril Cuecas Mil\", an event where the entire community dances the cueca, a traditional Chilean dance.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":702170,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"Materials and ingredients","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CL","country":"Chile","town":"San Bernardo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-30 -71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":157,"posted_date":"2011-01-30T14:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CLP","disbursal_amount":422706,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":21841},{"due_date":"2011-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":22376},{"due_date":"2011-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":22522},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22669},{"due_date":"2011-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":22816},{"due_date":"2011-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":22965},{"due_date":"2011-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":23114},{"due_date":"2011-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":23265},{"due_date":"2011-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":23416},{"due_date":"2011-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":23569},{"due_date":"2011-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":23722},{"due_date":"2011-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":23876},{"due_date":"2011-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":24032},{"due_date":"2011-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":24188},{"due_date":"2011-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":24346},{"due_date":"2011-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":24504},{"due_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":24664},{"due_date":"2011-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":24821}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.21},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.32},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.62},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.92},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.23},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.54},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.85},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.16},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.47},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.78},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.11},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.42},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.75},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.07},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.39},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.73},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.05},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.38}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":138.15,"local_amount":66739,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:38:28Z","rounded_local_amount":67548.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195839744,"comment":null},{"amount":237.7,"local_amount":114829,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:59:38Z","rounded_local_amount":116221.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201282236,"comment":null},{"amount":195.78,"local_amount":94583,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:56:28Z","rounded_local_amount":95729.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206150243,"comment":null},{"amount":251.99,"local_amount":121734,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:11:16Z","rounded_local_amount":123210.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211223326,"comment":null},{"amount":51.38,"local_amount":24821,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:03:02Z","rounded_local_amount":25121.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216502311,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-01-30T16:16:31Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T11:03:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":269119,"name":"Ruth Melania","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"la sra.

She lives in Bago City, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2001 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. \r\n\r\nBy working hard in her  business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 18000. Ma. Elena is borrowing PHP 15000 so that she can purchase more stocks to sell. This will be her 18th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 11000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. \r\n\r\nMa. Elena aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

She earns her living by operating a business selling dried fish.  She has six children between 16 and 30 years old \u2013 2 of them have families of  their own, 2 are working, and the other 2 are currently going to school. \r\n\r\nRemia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1999 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 24 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Remia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 12000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 20000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 25th loan, she is borrowing PHP 20000, which she intends to use as additional working capital so that she can continue to save up for the education of her children and for future needs.   Remia is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

is a 36-year old single woman who supports her family by operating a general store. She lives in Bago City, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2009 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. \r\n\r\nBy working hard in her general store business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 5000. \r\n\r\nFeby is borrowing PHP 9000 so that she can purchase more stocks to sell. This will be her 4th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 7000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step on her journey toward economic freedom. Feby aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nJacquelyn is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Jacquelyn owns and operates a tricycle transport business. Jacquelyn has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Jacquelyn joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Jacquelyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 11,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase tires and other accessories. \r\n\r\nJacquelyn is requesting a new loan of 11,000 PHP, which will be used to repair her vehicle to provide better service. This loan will be the 6th loan taken out by Jacquelyn from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to support her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She has requested a loan for 3500 Somoni to purchase additional inventory. Winter time is a very busy season for many grocery market vendors in Dushanbe. This loan will enable Shamigul to be prepared for the increased demand and earn some additional income that will help her and her family.   \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

are nothing unless one takes the effort to meet them. Violeta T., 57, knows this, and gives her best to accomplish the goals she has set for her and her family. She finished her high school studies and is married to Esteban T., 58, a jeepney driver. They have been blessed with one child,  who is currently in the third year level of her high school education.  Together, they live in  Paroloa, Tondo, Manila.\r\n\r\nVioleta helps her husband earn a living by managing a banana-que stand where she also sells packed meals which she cooks herself. Banana-que stands are popular in many different corners of Manila. Banana-que is a delicious saba banana, deep fried and coated with caramelized brown sugar.  This is one of the best Filipino comfort foods.  \r\n\r\nVioleta earns income by buying a variety of ripe bananas and selling them piece by piece with a minimum mark up.  Early in the morning, she also cooks the viands which are commonly used in Filipino breakfasts, packs them into Php 15-20 packets, and sells them to her neighbors and patrons in the community.  With these businesses, she is able to earn a minimum of Php 700.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, she would like to request a loan for Php 8,000. She will use this fund to buy more goods and raw materials needed for her banana-que stand and packed meals business. With the help of this loan, she will be able to continue her business and increase her earning capacity as a micro entrepreneur.\r\n\r\nVioleta learns the value of improving one\u2019s business, and thus works to innovate hers. She does not emphasize any problem she encounters, but rather focuses on its solution. Goals cannot be met simply by identifying the problem, but by acting on them. One of the most important goal she has in mind is to support her child until college graduation, at which point she will feel most fulfilled.\r\n\r\nAs CCT community partner, she faithfully attends to their weekly fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she received. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":702429,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She is an entrepreneur with a knack for multitasking who is accomplished in establishing businesses. Her training with CCT as a community partner has enabled her to be successful in business. \r\n<p>\r\nBeing in the direct-sales business, Maribel has developed the skill to choose quality products and deal with people in the neighborhood so as to turn them into regular customers. She sells shirts, pants, bags, shoes, cosmetics, fashion accessories and jewelry that suit the tastes of her friends and business connections. She earns an income by availing herself of discounts from product catalogs and then selling these items at their regular price to her customers. At the end of the month, she is able to earn a minimum net income of around 10,000 PHP.\r\n<p>\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a 27,000 PHP loan. She plans to use this loan to purchase items ordered in advance by her customers. She will also purchase items that are usually ordered by her patrons so that she will be ready to offer them to her clients. By doing this, Maribel believes that she will be able to increase her earning capacity as a micro-entrepreneur.\r\n<p>\r\nSure enough, Maribel does have her share of customers who do not pay on time. Nevertheless, she still prays that she will be able to collect their payments. She dreams of having her house renovated soon and that her business will continue to flourish so she can be of help to her family and relatives. \r\n<p> \r\nAll CCT community partners and clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of fifteen to thirty community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and pay microfinance loans. As a CCT community partner, Maribel faithfully attends CCT\u2019s weekly fellowship meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she

Being a high school undergraduate herself, she knows that there is nothing as important as an education for her nephew.\r\n<p>\r\nLolita sells garlic and onions, staples of Filipino cuisine. Every dish must contain either one or both of these. Lolita purchases wholesale onions and garlic, cleans and peels them, repackages them into 10 PHP or 5 PHP bags and then sells them to the local markets and the immediate community. She also sells plastic wares in the market. With these businesses, she is able to raise at least a minimum of 1,000 PHP gross in sales every day.\r\n<p>\r\nLolita is requesting a 8,000 PHP loan that she will use to buy more garlic and onions to expand her inventory. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business.\r\n<p>\r\nLolita dreams of being able to send her nephew to college through the profits she earns from her work. She also prays for good health for them both. \r\n<p>\r\nAll CCT community partners and clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of fifteen to thirty community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and make microfinance loan payments. Lolita faithfully meets with her co-fellowship members every week to share stories of her work. This is also a venue where she can draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she receives.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":702467,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"To buy more garlic and onions","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Tondo, Manila","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-01-28T05:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lolita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-01-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":533.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":53.33,"local_amount":2133.32,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:29:25Z","rounded_local_amount":2354.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195814223,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2666.65,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:38:08Z","rounded_local_amount":2943.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201256788,"comment":null},{"amount":53.33,"local_amount":2133.32,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:33:42Z","rounded_local_amount":2354.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206123481,"comment":null},{"amount":26.67,"local_amount":1066.71,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:49:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1177.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211194747,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-01-28T08:22:19Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T10:49:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":269216,"name":"Hanny","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hanny is a married woman with four children, three of whom attend school while one is still too young for school.

This situation drove Yuliani to do something to generate additional income for her family. \r\n\r\nShe used her little money as capital to initiate her business. She sells clothes that she orders from Java (the western part of Indonesia). She prefers to order her business stock from Java because of the cheaper price. Due to the limited capital that she had, she could only have limited stock to sell and as a result, she could only generate a small income. \r\n\r\nYuliani really wants to improve her business by adding more clothes and other items to sell.

As a responsible father, Paulus wants to provide his children with access to school. He wants them to have a bright future. \r\n\r\nPaulus wanted to improve his kiosk but he did not have enough capital to do it. He ever tried to borrow from a cooperative with daily repayment. But there was no improvement in his business as the profit was used to pay the installments. Paulus then heard about TLM\u2019s individual lending program and got interested in joining the program due to the monthly repayment system and achievable interest rate.

It is then cut into pieces and sold.\r\nShe sells her goods in cash and on credit at home, door-to-door, and at the market in North Pelengana to a clientele composed mainly of women.\r\nWith this loan, Ms. Kadiata Kakl\u00e9 hopes to realize an average monthly profit of 31,250 FCFA, which will be used to reinvest in her business and pay for her children's school fees."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":702664,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":"To buy raw materials to make local soap (potash and shea butter)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Pelengana Nord","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:33Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatoumata                 ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ma\u00efmouna                  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hawoye              ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadiata   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-01-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":175,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:20:27Z","rounded_local_amount":83779.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195918221,"comment":null},{"amount":175,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2011-03-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T12:13:02Z","rounded_local_amount":83779.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201361180,"comment":null},{"amount":175,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2011-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:48:48Z","rounded_local_amount":83779.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206226462,"comment":null},{"amount":175,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2011-05-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T12:00:31Z","rounded_local_amount":83779.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211301302,"comment":null},{"amount":175,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2011-06-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:52:21Z","rounded_local_amount":83779.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216580883,"comment":null},{"amount":175,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2011-07-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:30:33Z","rounded_local_amount":83779.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221750707,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-02-01T18:55:13Z","paid_date":"2011-08-15T09:30:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":269285,"name":"Monica","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Monica W.

He knows this business.  He\u2019s been doing it for 20 years and it has become a family tradition.  He started doing what he knew best, \u201cdecorating,\u201d when he became unemployed.  He specializes in fittings between locks and hinges for metal doors, gates, garage doors, and grilles.  Even though he has a variety of welding equipment and tools, his main goal is to industrialize his business and create jobs.  His great challenge is the lack of working capital, so he has seen fit to approach Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo for a Kiva loan.  This will be his first and he will invest the money in punching machines, which will make him more efficient, saving him time and money.\r\n\r\nOtoniel has proven to be well disciplined in his work and seeks more knowledge each day.  This is why he has many dreams about his company, and he knows that he will fulfill them, thanks to his efforts and support from groups, such as Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and Kiva, who help him with management.  He maintains the following: Gross revenue 89.19%, operating margin 57.06%, net revenue 47.06%, and profits from sales 87%.\r\n\r\nOtoniel makes and sells his products in hardware stores around the city of Barranquilla.

She is married with four children between the ages of 29 and 13. She arrived in the city at 15 years of age with high hopes of gaining a better quality of life. She studied part of her high school certificate before working for a private company where she made clothes for ten years. With the knowledge she gained throughout her time there, she finally decided to leave the company to start her own business at the age of 26, when she married and had four children. As time passed, her clothing business grew to be a workshop with two employees who operate the machinery.  \r\n\r\nThis is the fifteenth loan that Dermis has received from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. She has been part of this organisation for 16 years. With the help of this foundation she has been able to improve the infrastructure of her business, expand her client base and improve the conditions of the premises where her workshop is located. With this loan from Kiva, Dermis will purchase materials such as fabrics, thread, buttons and supplies to make school uniforms. This investment will be successful because she has contracts to make school uniforms and physical education uniforms for three schools in the area. \r\n\r\nDermis' dream is to continue improving her premises and to increase her production with more employees and more machinery operators. This is a challenge for her, as is the goal of attaining the ever-increasing efficiency and quality which the market she wishes to tap into demands. Dermis' current financial indicators are as follows: turnover on accounts receivable is 14 days, while inventory turnover is 7 days. Sales profit is at 30%, her current ability to make payments is 68% and her future ability to make payments with the loan is at 64%.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":701415,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"Purchase materials such as fabric, thread, buttons and supplies to make school uniforms","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-02-03T00:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dermis Kellys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":73191},{"due_date":"2011-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":77188},{"due_date":"2011-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":78475},{"due_date":"2011-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":79783},{"due_date":"2011-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":81112},{"due_date":"2011-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":82464},{"due_date":"2011-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":83839},{"due_date":"2011-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":85236},{"due_date":"2011-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":86656},{"due_date":"2011-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":88101},{"due_date":"2012-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":89569},{"due_date":"2012-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":94386}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.26},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.45},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.16},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.88},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.61},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.36},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.11},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.66},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.45},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.27},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.91}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":132.54,"local_amount":240983,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:09:00Z","rounded_local_amount":246790.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201289246,"comment":null},{"amount":139.15,"local_amount":252996,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:05:30Z","rounded_local_amount":259093.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206157385,"comment":null},{"amount":152.47,"local_amount":277226,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:17:56Z","rounded_local_amount":283907.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211230395,"comment":null},{"amount":125.84,"local_amount":228795,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:09:49Z","rounded_local_amount":234308.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216509257,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-02-03T07:56:02Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T11:09:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":269377,"name":"Donatha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Donatha is 47 years old.

She lives in Cartagena with her husband and three children who are 15, 12 and 10 years of age. Gloria lived in Chigorod\u00f3 in the coastal region of Antioquia until she was displaced in 1977. She was supported by Acci\u00f3n Social, an initiative of the Presidency of the Republic of Colombia, who provided her with publicly-subsidised housing and a small amount of working capital to start a business. With this capital and her experience, she was able to transform the business into a store. \r\n\r\nThis is the sixth loan that Gloria has taken out with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. Her business has grown ever since she has been linked with this organisation. Currently, Gloria needs to purchase a sliding window, provisions and groceries to maintain her store and stock it with dairy products, rice, oil, sugar and grains. For this reason she is requesting a loan through Kiva so that she can obtain more discounts and offer better prices to her buyers.\r\n\r\nHer greatest wish and the motivation behind her hard work is that in the future her children grow up to be successful professionals and good people. Her goal for the future is to stock up her store, increase her customer base and keep her store maintained with everything that her customers need to generate more profits so that she can continue to support her family.

He has 5 children, from one- to ten-years old.  He has worked along with his wife, with whom he has managed to build a successful business renting washing machines and selling washing soap and clothing, over the last two years.  He lives with his family in Carrizal, a neighborhood famous for its Carnivale celebration and for the music that is practically a way of life among the residents.  Rodolfo knows the neighborhood well and he's shaped his business to meet the needs that he sees.  He used to buy on credit himself so he identifies with his customers, normal people from the neighborhood who are often relatives and friends.  Rodolfo describes himself as responsible and serious.  He approached the Fundacion Mario Santo Domino for a low-cost loan to pay off another higher-interest loan.  His average monthly sales are COP$1,000,000 and his margin is 50%.  He will use this loan from Kiva to buy a washing machine so that he can meet growing demand for his washing machine rental business.  He will also pay cash for miscellaneous merchandise that he will buy in bulk.  Rodolfo's dream is to buy a house for his family.  He wants to continue expanding his business, something he can do with each new Fundacion loan.

[The Agro-industrial Women's Association of San Pedro de TR.] was formed in March 1997  when they acquired a farm from the Agrarian Development Institute, which they paid off over a period of 10 years. The group is made up of 6 women who grow greenhouse vegetables such as tomatoes, string beans, and sweet peppers, as well as producing coffee on their farm. The goal of the group is to gain additional income through promoting agribusiness activities as well as to benefit families in their community with profitable projects which are in accordance with the concepts of conservation and rational use of resources. \r\n\r\nSome of the main activities of the Association are:\r\n\r\n1.\tCoordinate with the Ministry of Agriculture, the Agrarian Development Institute and other Costa Rican public institutions to receive the technical assistance these institutions provide.\r\n2.\tProduce sweet peppers, tomatoes, chile seeds, string beans and other products, through controlled methods (greenhouses) for marketing and the generation of income. \r\n3.\tMaintain a coffee plantation, owned by the Association, which provides a fixed annual income. \r\n\r\nTheir first priority was to obtain a place where they could develop organic agriculture, encouraging women in their development as businesswomen. They have a farm in the San Pedro de Valverde Vega region in Alajuela province, located in Costa Rica's Central Valley, on the slopes of the Poas volcano.  \r\n\r\nIn addition to the coffee plantation, they own an area of greenhouses. These were damaged by strong winds in December 2010, including the partial destruction of one of the roofs. For this reason, they are requesting 228000 colones ($475) to complete these repairs, to supplement their own capital of 200000 colones from the sale of string beans which were produced in the greenhouses.\r\n\r\nMission:\r\nThe Association seeks sustainable development for itself, its members, and their families, through agribusiness diversification and new production technology, in order to offer diverse quality products in the marketplace, thereby securing new markets and opportunities for development.\r\n\r\nVision:\r\nTo be a self-governed organization of women who, by means of diversifying agribusiness activities, generate opportunities for the socio-economic development of their families. \r\n\r\nOnce the loan is granted and the different activities the group does are verified, they will demonstrate their ability to repay the amount in the specified timeframe. With this investment, they will repair the greenhouse, thereby strengthening the group's vegetable production as well.\r\n\r\nThe Association owns the farm and the greenhouse infrastructure. They split work shifts among the members, so they can support the project and at the same time tend to their families. It generates supplemental household income and allows members to support their children's education and improve their quality of life. At the same time, the coffee harvest generates seasonal employment for the region's people.

For four years she has been selling firewood which she buys wholesale and later sells at the different markets in her village.  She uses the patio of her home as the main warehouse for the wood which she keeps stockpiled.\r\n\r\nMost of the help she receives is from her eldest son who transports the firewood until it is all sold.  Over the past few years the firewood business has been profitable and has allowed her to increase her income.  Therefore she wants to increase her working capital and establish more sales points.  \r\n\r\nThis is her fifth loan through MFP.  She is very happy for the financial support and has always been good about paying back the loans on time.  She enjoys being part of the communal bank because of how committed and supportive the members are.  She is grateful to all the lenders who are helping her to grow her business.  She plans to use the loan to buy firewood at wholesale prices.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":703134,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fuel\/Firewood","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy

are nothing unless one takes the effort to meet them. Alicia M., 53, knows this, and gives her best to accomplish the goals she has set for herself and her family. She finished a two-year secretarial course and is a proud mother of two children who are now in high school and elementary school. She is a single mother and gives all her best as a variety store owner to sustain their living. Together, they live in Pasay City, Philippines.\r\n\r\nAlicia presently runs a sari-sari (variety) store that caters to needs that are more immediate than the nearest grocery in the community. Alicia has operated from home for five years now, and has gained regular customers who keep her business alive. She employs no one, and earns 10,000 Philippines pesos (PHP) a month.\r\n\r\nBecause her goal is to level up her business, she decided to borrow 27,000 PHP. She will use this to buy goods that her customers prefer. She will see to it that her store will not lack any valuable thing that her customers need, so that they will make hers their number one sari-sari store in the community.\r\n\r\nAlicia has learned the value of improving one\u2019s business, and thus works to innovate hers. She does not emphasize any problem she encounters but rather focuses on its solution. Goals cannot be met just by identifying the problem, but by acting on them.

Parnati and Yadi have been blessed with two children: Siswoyo and Abdi. Both have graduated from school and are currently living in Jakarta. \r\n\r\nParniati is running a food-stall business in Lili Market, about a 40-minute drive from Kupang City. She has been running this business for five years to support her husband, as his income from selling furniture is unstable as a result of expensive raw materials. Initially, Parniati aimed to run a second-hand clothes business, but this business will require her to move from one market to another market according to the market schedule. She then decided to run a food-stall business as she realized that not so many people run a similar business at the Lili Market, which is situated not far from her residence. \r\n\r\nTo run the business, Paniati borrowed money from a cooperative with daily repayment. The interest rate charged was quite high, but Parniati didn\u2019t have another option. Due to the limited capital that she has, Parniati couldn\u2019t improve her business. She then heard about TLM's lending program and got interested in joining the program for its monthly repayment and achievable interest rate. \r\n\r\nParniati is requesting a loan amounting to IDR 10,000,000 from TLM.

are nothing unless one takes the effort to meet them. Rowena B., 35, knows this, and gives her best to accomplish the goals she has set for herself and her family. She finished her high-school education and is married to Renante B., her business partner. They have been blessed with two children, both of whom are in high school now. Together, they live in Pasay City, Philippines.\r\n\r\nRowena presently runs a <i>sari-sari<\/i> (variety) store that caters to needs that are more immediate than the nearest grocery in the community. Alongside this, she also manages their own mineral-water refilling station, which is located adjacent to their house. With the help of her husband, they were able to raise at least a minimum gross sales of around 1,000 Philippines pesos (PHP) every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she decided to borrow 16,000 PHP. She will use this to buy goods that her customers prefer for her store. She will see to it that her store will not lack any valuable thing that her customers need, so that they will make hers their number one <i>sari-sari<\/i> store in the community.\r\n\r\nRowena learned the value of improving one\u2019s business, and thus works to innovate hers. She does not emphasize any problem she encounters but rather focuses on its solution. Goals cannot be met just by identifying the problem, but by acting on them. One most important goals she has in mind is to support her children until their college graduation, with which she will feel most fulfilled. She also looks forward to having their own house and lot someday.\r\n\r\nAs CCT community partner, she faithfully attends to their weekly fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she receives. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":703182,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

This time, for her fourth cycle loan, she is borrowing 12,000 PHP, which she intends to use to purchase more inventory to sell. Her goal is to continue to save up for the future expansion of  their house and to have an additional business.

She earns her living by operating two business ventures: a sari-sari (general) store and an Avon dealing business.  \r\n\r\nHer husband, Antonio C., who is 44 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have one child who is 17 years old. \r\n\r\nDesa joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she aspired to something better for her family. With the help of her past 16 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Desa has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 17th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 19,000, which she intends to use as additional working capital so that she can continue to save up for the future, fund her child's education, do house repairs and buy home appliances. \r\n\r\nDesa is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\"). NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon, a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

G. is a 33-year-old married woman who supports her family by operating two business ventures: an oyster business and a general store. \r\n\r\nShe lives in Hinigaran, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2006 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. \r\n\r\nBy working hard in her oyster and general store businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 6,000. \r\n\r\nLiny  is  borrowing PHP 13,000 so that she can purchase more stocks to sell. This will be her eighth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. \r\n\r\nLiny  aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well being by following the  Dungganon way.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\"). NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon, a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

is a 63-year-old married woman who supports her family by operating two business ventures: a small sugarcane plantation and a pig fattening business. She lives in Pamplona in the province of Negros Oriental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2007, and she has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard on her small sugarcane plantation and in her pig fattening business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of 7200 PHP. \r\n<p>\r\nLourdes is borrowing 25,000 PHP in order to fund her business operations. This will be her seventh loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 18,000 PHP, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Lourdes aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and to ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout NWTF: <br>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than 1 USD a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

is a married woman who lives in Pamplona, Negros Oriental. She earns her living fattening pigs. Her husband, Simplicio V. Jr., age 35, works as a laborer. They have two children who are 6 and 10 years old. \r\n\r\nMaricel joined NWTF-Project Dungganon on November 22, 2004, because she wanted something better for her family. With the help of her past six loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, and by the sweat of her brow, Maricel has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty. Her previous loan of 18,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of 15,000 PHP, thus improving the family's standard of living. This time, for her seventh cycle loan, she is borrowing 25,000 PHP which she intends to use to purchase feed and vitamins for pigs so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Maricel is a <i>Dungganon<\/i> woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means <u>honorable<\/u>). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them <i>Dungganon<\/i> - a title of esteem  that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

is a married woman who lives in Escalante City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating a sari-sari (general) store. Her husband, Rogelio N., who is 54 years old, works as a baker. They have six children who are between 13 to 32 years old. Three of her children have their own families, the fourth is working while the other two go to school. \r\n\r\nCecilia  joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1999 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 13 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Cecilia  has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 22,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4,000. \r\n\r\nFor her 14th loan, she is borrowing PHP 22,000 which she will use to purchase more stock to sell so that she can continue to save up for a future business and her children's education. \r\n\r\nCecilia  is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. About NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon -- a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the community's respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She earns her living by fishing. Her husband, Ramonito A., who is 35 years old, works as a driver. They have three children who are between two to five years old. \r\n\r\nJanice joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 13 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Janice has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 21,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000. \r\n\r\nFor her 14th loan, she is borrowing PHP 23,000 which she will use to purchase a fishing net and materials. Janice is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the community's respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 1995 and has improved her living conditions with the help of loans from NWTF and her own efforts. \r\n\r\nBy working hard in her fishing business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 10,000. Lydia is borrowing PHP 25,000 so that she can fund her business operations. This will be her 19th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 25,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. \r\n\r\nLydia aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the  Dungganon way.

is separated from her husband, and lives in Calatrava, Negros Occidental.

She has two children who are 14 and 17 years old.  \r\n\r\nAntonietta joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past six loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Antonietta has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 11,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000. \r\n\r\nFor her seventh loan, she is borrowing PHP 14,000 which she intends to use as additional capital for the business so that she can continue to save up for their future and her children's education. \r\n\r\nAntonietta is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. About NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass their dreams.

is a married woman who lives in Pulupandan in the province of Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating three business ventures: a business buying and selling Lapu-Lapu Fish, a sari-sari (general) store, and a public utility vehicle business. Her husband Alex L., age 33, works as a fish vendor, a driver, and a barangay (village) councilor to earn his living. He also helps in his wife's business activities. They have three children who are 1 to 10 years old.\r\n<p>\r\nLiza joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007, because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past six loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Liza has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 13,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 30,000 PHP, thus uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her seventh loan, she is borrowing 30,000 PHP, which she intends to use to purchase more stocks of Lapu-Lapu Fish. She plans to continue saving up for assets in order to have a better future. The picture shows Liza together with her husband in their Lapu-Lapu Fish business. Liza is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout NWTF: <br>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than 1 USD a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.
