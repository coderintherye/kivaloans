While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nMarylou is married and has four school-aged children. To make a living, Marylou owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector making & selling \"nipa\", a native roof, in their community. Marylou has been engaged in her business for over four years and earns approximately 2,400 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Marylou joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Marylou has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1,500 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used as additional capital for the business. Marylou is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the sixth loan taken out by Marylou from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve their living situation. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Profits are invested in food, health, and in their businesses.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Robin Clochard, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":520762,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase of grain","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Fougani Fana","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-04-08T05:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lala                           ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Kadiatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bah ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata Salifou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ami ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Keninkin ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djouraba ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ami ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":135000,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":33750},{"due_date":"2010-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":33750},{"due_date":"2010-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":33750},{"due_date":"2010-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":33750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":33750,"processed_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:15:02Z","rounded_local_amount":36747.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136746605,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":33750,"processed_date":"2010-05-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:18Z","rounded_local_amount":36747.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144779159,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":33750,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:16:50Z","rounded_local_amount":36747.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151961361,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":33750,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:49Z","rounded_local_amount":36747.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159699477,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-04-08T11:36:52Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":191557,"name":"Munhchimeg","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Munhchimeg is a 42-year-old widow who lives with her four children in Bayanhongor province, Mongolia.

School staff from this institution, like many other schools' staff within SMT\u2019s operational areas, come to SMT to apply for loans. With the help of these loans, they can accomplish certain tasks that they would otherwise not be able to accomplish with their mere salaries alone. But with the help of this loan, some can pay school fees for their children; others can use the loan to buy pieces of furniture, a plot of land, house-building materials, or invest in a business. At the end of each month, these teachers can repay the loan out of their monthly salaries. The institution\u2019s bursar is directly responsible for deducting the repayment and pays SMT on their behalf.\r\n\r\n59-year-old Edward B. K.

Jeanne is a Burundian aged 48. She lives in the Cibitoke neighborhood (Bujumbura-City center).  She is married to a carpenter and is herself a tailor She prefers this trade which allows her to work with her hands and on a sewing machine over an white-collar job. In 2002, she opened her own workshop that she calls \"Maman Anitha's Sewing Workshop\"--named after her first child. \r\n\r\nJeanne is the mother of 7 children, three boys and four girls. Only one of them did not attend school. All the others are enrolled in school and one is studying law at the university. At the beginning of the socio-political crisis in Burundi (1994), the whole family took refuge in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Coming back in 2000, Jeanne continued to work as a tailor with 12 years' experience. \r\n\r\nWith the Kiva loan, she intends to add to her capital and grow her business, buying shoes, lengths of African print cloth, and fabric coming from Uganda to sell in Burundi. After that, she already has plans to open a shop of her own in the central market of Bujumbura. Since her husband is presently out of work, Jeanne is the sole breadwinner for the family, paying school fees as well as the rent for the living quarters for their son who is studying at the university, and of course their food. \r\n\r\nJeanne is very grateful for the Turame initiative which aims to reduce poverty and support small businesspeople. She is part of the Tuzinduke group, a word that means in Kirundi \"Let's Rise and Shine\".

She lives with her husband and their three school age children.  She never worked.  She was only a housewife.  When they fired her husband, she did not know where to get money, and she went through some very difficult times.\r\n\r\nHer husband did not find work, and neither did she.  But, she did have a very good friend who told her to do something because her children were suffering.  Her friend, Bertha, helped her a lot.  Bertha motivated her to travel and get comforters.\r\n\r\nThat is the work she now does.  She delivers the comforters to stores and women for cash or credit.  She is happy now because she has income, and they do not have to suffer or worry about food like a lot of women.

Not one to be left out of this lucrative opportunity which had presented itself in her home area of Napier in Jinja, an enterprising and lively 35-year-old woman going by the name of M. Rashida made a decision to try to cash in on this craze.\r\n\r\nIn 2000, Rashida laid the starting foundation stone for her business. With the money she had saved working in a local beauty salon, she bought her first consignment of garments. With these she took root and, though her business has had its fair share of ups and downs, she has emerged as a resilient woman who has refused to buckle under any sort of pressure.\r\n\r\nWith this kind of spirit in tow, Rashida has made enormous headway as is manifest in the 60,000 shillings she purportedly makes in a week. She is one lady who likes taking a long view and as such she has drawn up a blueprint to expand her business selling secondhand clothes into a wholesale franchise.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Rashida is optimistic she will be empowered financially to see her dream come true.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1475,"image":{"id":520909,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"To buy bales of additional garments","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Jinja","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.583333 33.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2010-04-08T16:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1475,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rashida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sakina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Immaculate","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rajab","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hadijah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zula","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Madina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juma","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zula","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Susan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sabstain","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":3050000,"loan_amount":1475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":762500},{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":762500},{"due_date":"2010-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":762500},{"due_date":"2010-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":762500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":368.75},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":368.75},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":368.75},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":368.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":368.75,"local_amount":762500,"processed_date":"2010-04-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:53:30Z","rounded_local_amount":767672.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136733964,"comment":null},{"amount":368.75,"local_amount":762500,"processed_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:48:53Z","rounded_local_amount":767672.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144767247,"comment":null},{"amount":368.75,"local_amount":762500,"processed_date":"2010-06-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-20T07:46:12Z","rounded_local_amount":767672.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152662270,"comment":null},{"amount":368.75,"local_amount":762500,"processed_date":"2010-07-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:46:28Z","rounded_local_amount":767672.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159689043,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-04-13T23:51:47Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:46:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":191613,"name":"Pagando En Fe Y Amor Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nEl Banco D.

She wants to find a way to improve her family's quality of living. For this aspiration, she joined Kiva's partner, ASHI, and has been very happy to be given the chance of having working capital. The first few loans she received enabled her to operate a tricycle (motorcycle with sidecar) business. The profit from this business has been the main source of family income. \r\n\r\n<p>Now that she and her husband have secured access to capital, her proceeds are better than before. For that reason, she is now requesting another ASHI loan through Kiva for a much bigger amount. Specifically, the loan funds will be used to buy spare parts and pay for maintenance of her tricycle.  This will enable her to grow their business further so that they have savings in the future. Her long-term dreams are to continue supporting her children and grandchildren as well as building a home strong enough to withstand the flooding which is common in her province. Also, she dreams of having an additional new tricycle to earn more income so that they can move further away from the cycle of poverty.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":520922,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle

She is a hard-working woman, and for several years she has been selling cosmetics and clothing. Melania started this business with the savings from her previous work as a seamstress. Combining these funds with some help from her husband, she managed to invest into a small amount of cosmetics inventory. She sells cosmetics from Avon catalogs, but her sales volume is low, so she wants to invest more in order to increase her sales.\r\n\r\nMelania would like to improve the flooring in her house because it is in poor condition. She wants to install a ceramic floor and thus she needs to purchase the necessary materials in order to start the work. Her husband is a bricklayer, which is a advantage, since they don't have to pay the labor costs. Melania is happy about the improvements she has been making to her home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Andrei Vazhnov, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":520998,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"Purchase of ceramics and other materials for improving the floor which is in poor condition","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2010-04-08T01:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Melania Del Socorro","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":10000,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2010-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2010-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2010-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2010-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2010-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2010-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2010-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2011-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1111.12}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.78},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.78},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.77},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.78},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.78},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.78},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.77},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.78},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.78}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":55.55,"local_amount":1169.37,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:31:13Z","rounded_local_amount":1178.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144640161,"comment":null},{"amount":53.64,"local_amount":1129.18,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:01:06Z","rounded_local_amount":1138.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151821953,"comment":null},{"amount":53.06,"local_amount":1117.06,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:04:01Z","rounded_local_amount":1126.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159561963,"comment":null},{"amount":53.19,"local_amount":1119.79,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:17:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1128.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166770878,"comment":null},{"amount":53.19,"local_amount":1119.74,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T07:45:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1128.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172204770,"comment":null},{"amount":52.76,"local_amount":1110.64,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T12:04:02Z","rounded_local_amount":1119.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177330468,"comment":null},{"amount":53.32,"local_amount":1122.57,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T11:43:06Z","rounded_local_amount":1131.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182465626,"comment":null},{"amount":53.35,"local_amount":1123.07,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-19T09:10:14Z","rounded_local_amount":1132.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189097775,"comment":null},{"amount":46.94,"local_amount":988.58,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T00:48:01Z","rounded_local_amount":996.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191348401,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-05-03T21:42:48Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T00:48:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":191652,"name":"Daniel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Daniel, married and living with his wife and three children, runs a cereals shop with one employee in his hometown to earn a living.

He is married to 28 year old Elizabeth, and they have 3 children. They all live together in their own house. The need to offer their family good living conditions motivates Joel and his wife to work hard at growing potatoes, peas, and gladioli on their own land. Joel also has a stall in the major city market where he has been selling his products for 7 years, which earns him additional income. He also takes milk from his parents cows in order to help them with selling cheese. These trades allow him to provide all the basics that his loved ones need, and even to recently purchase two hectares of land where he is thinking of growing gladioli. He hopes that the income from his harvest will enable him to buy a house in the city and set-up a store, as well as having his vegetables at his current market stall. This is his fifth loan with MFP, and he states that he will continue to work with this community group with the same commitment as he had when he began. With the loan that he is requesting, he will buy 8 sacks of fertilizer, two bags of peas, and 5 bottles of insecticide. \r\n   \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Alison Hynd, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":521022,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy seed peas, fertilizer, and insecticide.

They own their own home and live there with two of their four children. \r\n\r\nFor 30 years, Julia has been a farmer, growing potatoes, peas, beans, and corn on her own land as well as on rented fields. She wakes up very early every morning to work in the fields with her husband. In her free time, she knits sweaters for men and women, which she is able to sell for approximately $25 each. Seasonally, she also sells clothing to her acquaintances on credit. \r\n\r\nJulia does not complain about working so hard. She knows that it ensures that she has enough income to cover her household expenses, to pay her children's school fees, and to save money for unexpected expenses.

She makes handicrafts from tagua (a large nut with an interior that looks and feels like ivory and can be carved into handicrafts.)  She started in this business when she worked in a factory and learned the trade.  Three years ago she became independent and, with an investment of 400 dollars, she bought a machine to cut the tagua.  Her work consists in cutting shapes for buttons.  To do this she travels to the city of Manta, where she acquires the raw materials.  She then makes her products and delivers them to a person who is in charge of sending them to other countries where they are given a final finish.  She does not have a set schedule but she works 8 hours a day.  As she works alone, she must organize herself to take the orders and avoid mistakes with the delivery of her work, because she must divide her time well between the work and her household tasks.  Each week she must have sufficient raw materials on hand in order to fulfill her orders on time.\r\n\r\nMariana joined the communal bank 2 loan cycles ago, and the money that she will receive from this loan will be invested in the purchase of tagua, because at this moment her workshop is small but she aspires to be able to buy a machine so that she can have employees and make her business grow.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":518196,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":"to buy tagua to make buttons","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-04-08T16:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":775,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariana De Jesus","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":770,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":64.13}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":64.59,"local_amount":64.17,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:18:33Z","rounded_local_amount":64.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136674849,"comment":null},{"amount":129.17,"local_amount":128.34,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:17:09Z","rounded_local_amount":129.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144709034,"comment":null},{"amount":193.76,"local_amount":192.51,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:46:56Z","rounded_local_amount":193.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151892332,"comment":null},{"amount":129.17,"local_amount":128.34,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:32Z","rounded_local_amount":129.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159632703,"comment":null},{"amount":129.18,"local_amount":128.34,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:15:26Z","rounded_local_amount":129.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166846749,"comment":null},{"amount":129.13,"local_amount":128.3,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:07:20Z","rounded_local_amount":129.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172113269,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-04-09T01:46:52Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:07:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":191676,"name":"Maria Luisa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nLa Sra.

She is 56 years old and the leader of a nine-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Donatela R.'s group.\r\n\r\nDonatela is married and has six adult children. To make a living, she sells seafood products including fish and shrimp in her local community. She has had this business for over five years and earns approximately 7000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Donatela joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Donatela is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP which will also be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the second loan taken out by Donatela from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI: ASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

Bantilan Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Najil B. is from the village of Taboo, Jimenez. She is 33 years old. Najil is the group leader of a 2-member group loan offered by PMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Najil B. Group.\r\n\r\nNajil is married and has 4 school-aged children. To make a living, Najil owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector running a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Najil has been engaged in her business for over 1 year and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Najil joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Najil has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Najil is requesting a new loan of 30,500 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the 11th loan taken out by Najil from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":513892,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She lives together with her family in the city of Balykchi.  She is thirty-seven years old.  Gulzaina is raising three daughters, all of whom attend school.  The oldest daughter is in eighth grade, the middle is in fourth, and the youngest daughter is in third grade.  Gulzaina is a widow.  This is why she has to come up with at least twice as much to support her family.  Previously, she obtained a loan in the sum of five thousand som ($100) at a micro financing organization and bought a calf.  Since then, she actively started increasing her livestock headcount, and now her livestock is in her parents\u2019 care in a village.  Currently, Gulzaina has two cows, one calf and six sheep.  And she achieved all this in four years.  Gulzaina also decided not to stay put and got a job as an attendant at a sauna.  She wants to increase her livestock headcount and, thus, achieve financial independence.  Livestock is a good asset for Gulzaina, which would hopefully let her finance her children\u2019s education in the future or start another type of small business.  She believes that with the current tempo, it is realistic to resell livestock in the future and purchase an apartment.  Currently, Gulzaina needs a loan.  She wants to invest money into purchasing four sheep for subsequent resale.\r\n\r\nGulzaina has three partners in the group:\r\n\r\nJanarkul I. is forty-six years old.  She has two children.  Her son is thirteen years old and daughter is five.  Janarkul and her husband sell household goods.  This yields them about a thousand and a half som.  Due to the winter season, Janarkul has not been selling and hopes to obtain a loan now and rebuild her business.\r\n\r\nGulmira O. is fifty years old.  She is a mother of two sons.  Gulmira started her business with a purchase of 1000 kg of fish that she sold for five som each.  Now, she has a consistent income in the sum of twelve thousand som.

However, despite all the obstacles, he continues searching and finally finds that opportunity as a result of certain circumstances and conditions.  It is especially important that at this moment, a person would not get scared, but would take this brave step, the step toward a better future.  The leader of the group, Aida I., decided to take this step.  She already had a job and could have calmly continued her modest existence.  However, in 2007, she found a job at a company that sold cosmetics through network marketing.  Aida is thirty years old.  She has a seven-year-old daughter, who currently attends school and goes to first grade.  In order to support herself and her daughter, Aida is involved in cosmetics sales and also works as an assistant to a sanitary physician.  Her salary is two thousand two hundred som ($50).  She has been involved in cosmetics sales for the third year already, and her monthly income increased to two and a half thousand som ($60).  It should be noted that at the cosmetics sales company, Aida is involved in a fairly new way of sales, network marketing.  The specifics of this type of sales include input from the client and a constant search for customers in order to increase income.  And now Aida needs a loan in order to purchase cosmetics for sale.\r\n\r\nJanylbubu T. is forty-six years old.  She is a mother of two sons, both of whom attend school.  The oldest son will be graduating from school this year.  Janylbubu sews national dresses at home and also gets orders from her permanent customers.  She is requesting this loan for the purchase of fabric for sewing.\r\n\r\nKulay A. is forty-six years old.  Her husband works as a welder.  Kulay and her husband raised two children.  In order to help her husband support the family, Kulay wants to find a job at the alcohol manufacturing plant.  She needs a loan in order to pay her daughter-in-law\u2019s education contract.\r\n\r\nGulnur K. is twenty-five years old.  She has two children, both of whom go to a kindergarten.  Gulnur\u2019s husband is involved in livestock fattening and sales.  Two years ago, he bought a cow, successfully sold it and then started buying cattle specifically for fattening and resale.  Gulnur requested the loan in order to buy two cows.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Anna Sorokina-Hailey, Kiva

Probably the main factor driving these people to go forward is the sole conviction of these people that they deserve something better in this life than to just obtain allowances from Government and wait for better times. Maybe another factor which makes these people different from the crowd is their feeling of responsibility for the future of their children. They feel themselves responsible for building a decent life for the sake of the wellbeing of their children.\r\n\r\nAigul T., the leader of this group, is forty-three years old and is divorced. She has a daughter who has turned twenty-one and who works in a private company, obtaining a salary of $60.\r\n\r\nAigul trades in vegetables at the market and her income is somewhere around $175 a month. During summertime her daughter helps her in the business. Aigul started selling vegetables fifteen years ago. During this time she has been able to buy a two-room flat (apartment) and see her daughter married.\r\n\r\nAigul wants to expand her assortment of vegetables and therefore decided to apply for this loan.

She and her husband have been able to buy a house, even though their salaries are not so high. Now Damira needs a loan to buy a circular.\r\n\r\nJuma M., 51, is a taxi-driver. He manages to earn two to three dollars a day. His spouse is a housewife and they have two children. His elder son is also a driver, working in the capital. Juma needs a loan, as he plans to buy a battery.\r\n\r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---<\/b>\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of the 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable in order to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

Two and half years ago, she bought a cow and since then she has been trying to increase the population of her livestock. \r\n<p>\r\nNow her accountant's salary is a little over 80 USD a month. She would like to have income from selling milk and trading in cattle during weekends at a cattle market. She has decided to apply for a loan to buy two lambs, pay a shepherd for grazing, and buy forage for them. In the future she hopes to buy a car for her son and furniture for her home.\r\n<p>\r\nGulzaira T., 49, is a widow. Her son works in a resort and earns a salary of 185 USD. Gulzaira does odd jobs in some factory. She hopes to obtain this loan to buy a big carpet and some clothes.\r\n<p>\r\nAnarkul A., 41, is single. She keeps some cattle at her parent\u2019s and works as a laborer in \u201cPAT\u201d factory.

Apal is a laborer in a \u201cPAT\u201d company and earns a salary of around 85 USD.

Sometimes it is this money that becomes a deposit for a prosperous future.  These qualities and especially, the ability to guess the future, pragmatism and keen calculation, differentiate good businessmen from ignorant ones.  It is interesting to know whether Kalira I., the leader of this group, imagined twelve years ago, when she, having saved money from her salary, bought a bull for fattening and subsequent resale, that in the future this business would become her primary source of income.  Now Kalira is fifty-one years old.  She no longer works at her job, but runs her business.  She raised one son and several daughters.  The son is already married and has children.  Kalira leads an active life: she helps her husband and son take care of livestock and also helps raise the grandchildren.  She has three children: two granddaughters and one grandson.  The oldest two granddaughters are already in school, and the youngest grandson is only nine months old.  Kalira watches how her grandchildren grow and wants to prepare a decent inheritance for them.  Thanks to her livestock business, she was able to provide her children with an education and to marry off her daughters.  Currently, her monthly income is four thousand seven hundred som ($100).  She continues to help her children.  And now Kalira requested a loan in order to pay for her daughter-in-law\u2019s education.\r\n\r\nAyzada S. is twenty-eight years old.  She went through a great test of endurance because now she has to raise four children by herself.  Two of them are her daughters, and two others are her nephews.  Ayzada is divorced.  She breeds livestock and sells cows at the livestock market.  Her income is four thousand nine hundred som.\r\n\r\nToktobu T. is fifty-one years old.  Her husband sells auto parts at a market, and she is involved in animal husbandry and sells milk.  She earns a little less than five thousand som from the animal husbandry business.  Toktobu hopes to get the loan to purchase a cow in order to increase livestock headcount.\r\n\r\nNurlan S. is twenty-five years old.  His wife is a homemaker.  Nurlan is involved in passenger transportation.  He used to work in Russia.  He saved money there, bought a car and started the transportation business.  Currently, his income is about six thousand som.  He requested the loan in order to repair his car.  Nurlan has two daughters.  He set a goal to buy an apartment for his family.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Anna Sorokina-Hailey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1225,"image":{"id":521257,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Paying for daughter-in-law's tuition","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Karabalta","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":135,"posted_date":"2010-04-20T07:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kalira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ayzada","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Toktobu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nurlan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":55000,"loan_amount":1225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":4479},{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":4527},{"due_date":"2010-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":4832},{"due_date":"2010-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":5137},{"due_date":"2010-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":5264},{"due_date":"2010-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":5582},{"due_date":"2010-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":5815},{"due_date":"2010-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":6174},{"due_date":"2010-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":6446},{"due_date":"2011-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":6744}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.76},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.83},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.62},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.42},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.24},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":129.51},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.51},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":143.57},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150.21}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":99.76,"local_amount":4479,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:35:58Z","rounded_local_amount":4560.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136715790,"comment":null},{"amount":100.83,"local_amount":4527,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-11T07:45:44Z","rounded_local_amount":4609.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144748636,"comment":null},{"amount":107.62,"local_amount":4832,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-11T07:46:02Z","rounded_local_amount":4920.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151931611,"comment":null},{"amount":114.42,"local_amount":5137,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:35:34Z","rounded_local_amount":5230.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159670622,"comment":null},{"amount":117.24,"local_amount":5264,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:38:33Z","rounded_local_amount":5359.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166884273,"comment":null},{"amount":124.33,"local_amount":5582,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:24:28Z","rounded_local_amount":5683.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172151406,"comment":null},{"amount":129.51,"local_amount":5815,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:11:11Z","rounded_local_amount":5921.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177446438,"comment":null},{"amount":137.51,"local_amount":6174,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:57:26Z","rounded_local_amount":6286.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182585624,"comment":null},{"amount":143.57,"local_amount":6446,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:00:21Z","rounded_local_amount":6563.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188721497,"comment":null},{"amount":150.21,"local_amount":6744,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:36:40Z","rounded_local_amount":6866.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191460108,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-04-29T10:04:20Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T04:36:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":191752,"name":"Ban","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Ban P., aged 43, is a farmer.

Samarkul earns her livelihood by trading in convenience goods at market.\r\n<p>\r\nTen years ago she started selling eggs and then switched to selling convenience goods. The trade appeared to be successful and she started to make profits. These profits allowed her to marry her daughters and son.\r\n<p>\r\nNow, her monthly income is around 165 USD. For Samarkul nothing is in her way to go forward and expand her trade. She has executed her obligation as a parent to marry them and help them get on their feet.

This business yields her about seven hundred som ($15) per month.  She is the leader of this group.  Begaim spent most of her life living in a rural area and involved in agriculture.  After her marriage, her parents left her two cows to start her own household.  Twenty-seven years have passed since then.  Begaim became a mother herself and had five children.  Two daughters already got married and live separately.  The son (he is twenty-four) also became involved in agriculture and actively helps Begaim take care of livestock.  One other son (he is fifteen years old) is in eighth grade, and the youngest son is in second grade.  Begaim\u2019s husband always takes care of the household side-by-side with Begaim and helps his wife raise the children, and, together with his son, tries to constantly increase livestock headcount.  Their income does not only come from the sale of eggs, but also from sale of milk and reaches up to two thousand som ($40) per month.  Daily duties do not tire Begaim at all.  On the contrary, she is eager to keep more livestock and increase her family income.  And life gets more expensive every day and makes it necessary to make some hard decisions and push forward.  Begaim decided to request this loan because it will let her buy a cow for fattening and milk sales, and several sheep for resale in the autumn.\r\n\r\nKanatbek A. is forty-six years old.  His wife does not work and stays home with the youngest son.  Kanatbek has four children.  In order to support the family, he is involved in breeding livestock and earns about three thousand som per month.  He hopes to obtain this loan and buy one cow and four sheep for fattening.\r\n\r\nMayramkul S. is forty-eight.  She sells seven to eight liters of milk per day and earns about four thousand som per month.  Throughout the thirty years of marriage, she raised six children.

This town has been long known for the unique beauty of its surrounding nature.  Tourists from many countries come here to enjoy the clean mountain air, skiing at ski resorts and also just look at the nature, mountain trees and majestic mountains of Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nTamara is fifty-eight years old.  She lives together with her husband, oldest son, daughter-in-law and youngest daughter.  Tamara\u2019s husband is retired and spent the last few years on permanent rest.  The oldest one is a taxi driver.  The second son is a student.  He goes to one of the universities in the capital.  The son\u2019s salary is obviously not enough for the whole family, and Tamara and her husband are involved in a domestic business.  They grow potatoes and milk, five to six liters, per day, and this yields them close to two thousand som per month.  Also, Tamara sells eggs.  Once Tamara and her husband took twenty tons of potatoes to Kazakhstan and successfully sold it.  They were able to buy a kashar (barn for livestock located at the bottom of the mountains near a pasture).  So everyone in the family stays busy.  Tamara needs some help.  She needs a loan in order to buy diesel fuel for field work.  It is needed to prepare the field for sowing potatoes.\r\n\r\nDjumakul S. is fifty years old.  She raised five children.  Djumakul tried to provide for her children all her life and to this day, finds no rest.  Even now, she works at a school as a server at a buffet.  Her salary is only eight hundred thirty som.  Djumakul\u2019s husband is involved in electrical and welding work, and one of the sons is involved in agriculture.  This is why Djumakul hopes to obtain this loan and help her son buy diesel fuel for field work.\r\n\r\nKenjekan R. is forty-eight years old.  She has six children.  The oldest daughter is twenty-seven, and the youngest son is eleven years old.  Kenjekan works at the village outpatient clinic, and the husband retired and does not work.  She hopes to get this loan in order to buy diesel fuel and help her son with field work.\r\n\r\nJyldyz U. is twenty-five years old.  She has two twin sons.  Her husband works as a tractor-combainer driver, and Jyldyz sells five liters of milk daily, which helps the husband support the family.  She requested this loan in order to buy diesel fuel for spring field work.  They plan to plant wheat.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Anna Sorokina-Hailey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":521307,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase of diesel fuel for field work","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Tup","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":135,"posted_date":"2010-04-20T07:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tamara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djumakul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kenjekan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jyldyz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":45000,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":3517},{"due_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":3832},{"due_date":"2010-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":3953},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":4092},{"due_date":"2010-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":4397},{"due_date":"2010-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":4606},{"due_date":"2010-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":4758},{"due_date":"2010-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":5025},{"due_date":"2010-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":5290},{"due_date":"2011-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":5530}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.16},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.15},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.85},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.93},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.71},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.36},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.73},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":111.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":117.55},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":122.89}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":78.16,"local_amount":3517,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:35:57Z","rounded_local_amount":3573.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136715795,"comment":null},{"amount":85.15,"local_amount":3832,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-11T07:45:43Z","rounded_local_amount":3893.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144748641,"comment":null},{"amount":87.85,"local_amount":3953,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-11T07:46:01Z","rounded_local_amount":4015.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151931616,"comment":null},{"amount":90.93,"local_amount":4092,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:35:30Z","rounded_local_amount":4157.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159670627,"comment":null},{"amount":97.71,"local_amount":4397,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:38:22Z","rounded_local_amount":4467.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166884277,"comment":null},{"amount":102.36,"local_amount":4606,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:24:14Z","rounded_local_amount":4679.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172151410,"comment":null},{"amount":105.73,"local_amount":4758,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:10:43Z","rounded_local_amount":4833.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177446442,"comment":null},{"amount":111.67,"local_amount":5025,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:56:57Z","rounded_local_amount":5105.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182585628,"comment":null},{"amount":240.44,"local_amount":10820,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:00:50Z","rounded_local_amount":10992.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188721499,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-04-22T19:34:00Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T14:00:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":191775,"name":"Luz","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Luz H., 41, is making sure that her family has enough provisions for their daily needs.

Nenita has a variety store to help with the family's income and chance for a better life. \r\n\r\nNenita has been a regular member of Center for Community Transformation* (CCT) for more than a year. She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with previous loans, she was able to borrow quite a few times in CCT\u2019s Cooperative. She is consistent in paying her dues and uses the money she borrows to expand and improve her variety store. To ensure the success of her business, she would like to apply for a PHP 25,000 loan. This amount will be used as a source of added capital for her expanding business by buying groceries needed to replenish her inventory.

He regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings and pays his weekly dues consistently. Because of his good repayment performance with his previous loans, he was able to borrow quite a few times in CCT\u2019s Cooperative.  He uses the money he borrows to expand and improve his businesses.\r\n\r\nNow, with your help, he would like to apply for a Php 40,000 loan. This will be used as added capital for his expanding business by buying products needed to replenish and sustain his inventory. He dreams that his business will continue to grow so that he can provide for his children\u2019s education until they finish their degrees. \r\n\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

K. produces palm oil locally for sale at Jukwa.To prepare her palm oil, she gets palm nuts from farmers on the farm.

Water is then added to the pounded fruit. The mixture of water and the pounded fruit is squeezed and filtered to get the juice out and the chaff removed. (The chaff is sometimes used by the local people to light charcoal fires).The juice is boiled again and as it boils the fresh oil will be seen floating on the surface of the pot; it is scooped into yet another pot and left to cool. Fresh oil from palm fruits is traditionally used in eating roasted yam or plantain in Africa \u2013 especially on the farms after a hard day's work.\n\nEfua has received junior high education.

The cooked fruits are strained and put into a big mortar and gently squeezed with a pestle avoiding damaging the nut but only to peel the pulp covering the nut. Water is then added to it, the juice obtained is strained separating the nut and taking out the chaff with the hand. (The chaff is sometimes used by the local people to light charcoal fire).The juice is boiled again and as it boils, the fresh oil will be seen floating whilst the water keeps boiling beneath.

When Fidel started his own family he didn't doubt to continue working in what he knew best, agriculture, which was his passion. Since then he has worked cultivating star fruit (a jungle fruit, which is used to prepare juice), and he likes this job very much as it gives him good earnings, permitting him to maintain his family. He also likes the smell that the fruit omits. Although normally he sows by himself, when the production increases Fidel contracts several workers who help him clean and prepare the soil. He has planned to increase his production to sell a greater quantity of fruit and begin sowing plantains. This is his sixth loan with MFP, and he is very thankful to all the people that made possible the support for him to continue working.

Since she was very young, she worked to help out her parents and thus learned everything she needed to cultivate the land and yield a good production. Every day she wakes up very early to tend to her potato and pea crops, which she previously planted with a lot of care and patience. Then, after numerous months of hard work, she hopes her efforts bear fruit and she can pick all her crops and transport them to the market, where she can sell them at a good price. This is what has transpired over the 12 years she has dedicated herself entirely to this activity. Furthermore, she says that she enjoys her work because she can continue the legacy passed down from her parents, as the land will help make headway for her family. In the future, she plans to plant larger quantities to increase her profits, which will help cover the costs of her children's education. This is her third loan cycle with Kiva partner MFP, and she is very certain this will help her increase her production. Her work with her community bank has been good, and all of the members are very responsible with their payments.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Analyn A.'s Group.\r\n\r\nAnalyn is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Analyn owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector running a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Analyn is just starting this business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Analyn joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Analyn is requesting a new loan of 6000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Analyn from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. She also believes in the quotation that says: \"If there's a will, there's a way.\"\r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fishers, and small-business entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is the group leader of a 12-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is the Leilanie G. Group.\r\n\r\nLeilanie is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, she owns and operates a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Leilanie is just starting this business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Leilanie joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She is requesting a loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the first loan she has taken out from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the central and north-eastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Simplicia M. is 48 years old and is from the village of San Isidro. She is the group leader of a 15-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is the Simplicia M. Group.\r\n\r\nSimplicia is married and has eight school-aged children. To make a living, she owns and operates a furniture making business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from making and selling general household furniture to local businesses and community members. Simplicia has been engaged in her business for over 18 years and earns approximately 15,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Simplicia joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. As with her previous loan of 12,000 PHP from ASKI which she has successfully repaid, this new loan of 12,000 PHP will also be used to purchase raw materials to make additional furniture. This will be the fifth loan she has taken out from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the central and north-eastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

As with her previous loan of 30,000 PHP from ASKI which she has successfully repaid, this new loan of 20,000 PHP will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the ninth loan she has taken out from ASKI.
