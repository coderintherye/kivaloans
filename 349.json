The official name of this borrowing group is Jhona A. Group. \r\n\r\nJhona is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Jhona owns and operates a business selling a variety of daily use products and providing load for cellular communication in the local community.

F. is 37 years old and owns a pupuseria (an eatery where pupusas are sold) wherein she makes and sells pupusas (typical, popular El Salvadorian dish comprised of stuffed flatbreads) filled with cheese, or stuffed with a combination of ingredients such as pork scratching, beans and cheese.  Marinella has been selling pupusas from her home for the last nine years.  Marinella lives in the town of Cojutepeque, in the district of Cuscatl\u00e1n where she lives with her senior citizen parents and her only child, a son of five years.  In spite of much competition, Marinella has built up a sizeable clientele due to the exquisite taste of her pupusas.   She requires a loan to purchase more corn, cheese, pork rind, beans and other ingredients, which are necessary to make the pupusas.  The need to increase sales is of equal importance to Marinella and her family due to the fact that she is the sole provider for her family.  Due to the advanced age of her parents, Marinella has to work extremely hard to support her parents and her young son who is completely dependent on her.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

She lives with her husband, her mother, and her two grandchildren, one 10 and the other 8 years old, both of which attend school.  Maria is a very enterprising woman, whom watches over the wellbeing of her family and wishes to contribute just as much as her husband towards their household expenses in order to never have to be in debt.  She owns a store that sells perishable products.  In addition, she sells comestics such as hair gel, nail polish, and deodorants, which allows her to earn some extra income.  She is seeking out a loan so that she can increase the quantity of products in her store.  She has owned her store for five years and even now, she finds it difficult to stock it with all of the necessary items.  For this reason, she hopes to obtain products that are in high demand, such as basic grains, soft drinks, and meat.  Ultimately, she wants to increase sales so that she can provide a better life for her family, who depend heavily on her and her husband to move ahead.    <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Tracy Quan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":485383,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchase food products.

As such, she wishes to be able to add more products to her shop.  This is why she has sought out a loan, with which she plans to purchase rice, beans, sugar, dairy products, and other necessary items to make her store a well-stocked one.

is 28 years old and married with a one-year-old child. He is a farmer in the Nyamira area of Western Kenya. He's been farming for three years and already employs six people. He sells milk, tea, and cereals locally. He also earns income from selling clothes. He says that the main challenges to growing his business are poor market conditions, lack of financing, and diseases that strike his livestock.\r\n\r\nHe requested this loan through the Kiva field partner, Juhudi Kilimo, for 60,000 KES to purchase and insure a dairy cow. He has successfully repaid a previous loan of 45,000 KES.  He says this new loan will help him better provide for his family's needs because of the increased milk production. In the future, he'd like to produce at least 50 litres each day.\r\n\r\nAbout Juhudi Kilimo\r\nJuhudi Kilimo is an innovative, for-profit social enterprise working with smallholder farmers in Kenya.

She is 30, and she is very devoted to her business.  For the moment she lives with her life partner and son in her mother\u2019s house.\r\n\r\nShe has had a convenience store for seven years.  She set it up in her current house.  Betty cleans and arranges the products in her store starting at six in the morning.  She also prepares the condiments that she sells ground.

But, as it is profitable, she is now accustomed to the work.\r\n\r\nBetty has the motto, \u201cMy store needs to have everything and needs to be very clean\u201d.  That is why she works so hard all of the time for her store to look good.  This attracts the neighbors\u2019 attention.  She generally works alone because her husband works in transportation with his \u201cmotocarro\u201d (three wheeled motor vehicle).\r\n\r\nThis year both of them have proposed saving money to buy a piece of land where they can build their own house for their son\u2019s well-being.\r\n\r\nThis is the third time that she has had a loan with MFP.  She knows that if she is responsible she will continue to get loans, which will allow her business to grow and make her dream come true.

She really enjoys her work because it allows her to have conversations with many people while bringing her an income.\r\n\r\nShe started out making and selling various desserts.  She moved forward little by little, and together with her husband, they were able to build their home, which includes a small retail space that she rents out.  Blanca has not stopped selling her treats on foot.  She walks all of the streets, especially those where there are more young people, who are her biggest customers.  Being busy what she likes to do the most, especially since this way she is able to earn an income without stress.\r\n\r\nHer plan is to build three more rooms onto her home so she can rent them out and be able to cover her needs in her old age.\r\n\r\nThis will be her third loan through MFP, and she reiterates that she will continue to work responsibly and that this loan will be very helpful for the advancement of her business.

Age 40, she is very dedicated to the care of her husband and her children, age 20 and 10 years, with whom she lives in their own house.  ,\r\n\r\nHer good character wins her many friends which she decided to build upon, starting a clothes sale business, which has gone very well.

She prefers to work in this manner because she earns a lot more, although initially she lost part of her capital from lack of payment.  But, thanks to the support of her husband and from experience, she learned to select her clients and make her business profitable.

Since she saw that she could generate a good income this way, she decided to devote more of her time to the business. She sells her products starting at 10:30 a.m., going out onto the streets and to the market to offer her delicious sweets. With her first loan of 300 Peruvian new soles, she purchased purple corn by the kilo, as well as sugar and some utensils. She tells us that her business is going very well and it is quite popular, thanks to the delicious flavor of her sweets. She is currently continuing with the same business. \r\n\r\nWith this loan for 2,500 Peruvian new soles, she will buy supplies to prepare her sweets, such as purple corn, rice and sugar by the kilo, as well as apples, pineapples, ground cinnamon and other ingredients to provide delicious flavor. She will also buy some utensils such as plastic cups and spoons. \r\n \r\nRamona feels like a satisfied woman, happy with what she has achieved. She is grateful to the Manuela Ramos Movement organization for helping her fulfill her goals and dreams, as well as for helping other women who want to grow and get ahead. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":484195,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"Buying ingredients to prepare rice pudding and mazamorras","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"San Mart\u00edn","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2010-02-09T22:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ramona ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-14T08:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":416.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.83},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.84},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.83},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.84},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.83},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":145.83,"local_amount":416.67,"processed_date":"2010-02-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:43:56Z","rounded_local_amount":418.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123954530,"comment":null},{"amount":145.84,"local_amount":416.67,"processed_date":"2010-03-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-23T07:54:28Z","rounded_local_amount":418.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128987556,"comment":null},{"amount":145.83,"local_amount":416.67,"processed_date":"2010-04-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-02T07:56:15Z","rounded_local_amount":418.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136713582,"comment":null},{"amount":145.84,"local_amount":416.67,"processed_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-26T08:09:32Z","rounded_local_amount":418.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144746628,"comment":null},{"amount":145.83,"local_amount":416.67,"processed_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-27T07:48:58Z","rounded_local_amount":418.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151929801,"comment":null},{"amount":145.83,"local_amount":416.65,"processed_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-28T07:53:07Z","rounded_local_amount":418.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159668977,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-02-10T08:01:03Z","paid_date":"2010-08-28T07:53:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":174721,"name":"Reynaldo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Reynaldo P.

It is starting its second loan cycle with a total of 12 members.\r\n\r\nCarmen is single and has a 5-year-old child. After finishing her studies, Carmen borrowed money from her parents to invest in a business selling school supplies. Her mother, who is a longtime member of the communal bank, invited Carmen to participate. During her time with FINCA, Carmen's sales have increased, because she can invest more money in her business, and she has learned to save. The loan she is now requesting will permit her to buy a photocopier and to stock her business with notebooks, pencils, pencil holders, drawing supplies and all types of useful products for the beginning of the school season. Carmen's dream is to have her own house and her own shop. \r\n\r\nVilma is married and has 3 children, aged 16, 22 and 24. The communal bank, has helped her learn how to save. She started a business selling clothes, and thanks to the loans she has received, she has been able to buy shelves. Now she also sells jewelry, gifts and perfumes, and she would like to take advantage of the school season and invest the funds from the new loan in school uniforms to sell. \r\n\r\nMariluz is single and has a 4-year-old child. She started a business selling cosmetics by catalog. She did not have much capital and did not receive support from any financial institution until a friend invited her to participate in the FINCA communal banks. Thanks to the loans, she has a little more capital, which she has invested in merchandise to sell, such as school supplies, hair clips, combs, mirrors and soaps. With the current loan, she will buy student lunchboxes and some educational games. Her dream is to have a large jewelry store. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3850,"image":{"id":485705,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchasing merchandise such as school supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Huancavelica","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.766667 -74.983333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2010-02-19T19:30:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3850,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vilma Mercedes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmen Pilar","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vilma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Erika Susan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary Luz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Orlanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dominga Brigida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gema Judith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cinthia Evelyn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rocio Elvira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":11000,"loan_amount":3850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1833.32},{"due_date":"2010-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1833.32},{"due_date":"2010-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1833.32},{"due_date":"2010-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1833.32},{"due_date":"2010-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1833.32},{"due_date":"2010-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1833.4}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":641.66},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":641.66},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":641.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":641.66},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":641.66},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":641.69}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":641.66,"local_amount":1833.32,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:53:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1840.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128943669,"comment":null},{"amount":1283.33,"local_amount":3666.68,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:16:38Z","rounded_local_amount":3681.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136671969,"comment":null},{"amount":641.66,"local_amount":1833.28,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:15:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1840.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144705884,"comment":null},{"amount":1283.35,"local_amount":3666.72,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-17T07:53:55Z","rounded_local_amount":3681.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152157854,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-02-24T23:46:52Z","paid_date":"2010-07-17T07:53:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":174744,"name":"Adolfo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Adolfo Q. es un hombre trabajador de una maquiladora y esta preocupado por el bienestar de su familia.

He earns a living mainly from farming grains prominent in the country's diet and which are very important to the economy. \r\nBut as this line of work is only possible during the winter, he would like to buy and sell cattle as a small producer during the summer months. \r\nMr. Basilio P\u00e9rez started working in agriculture as a young boy in his parents' farm. He continued in this line of work thanks to a small inheritance from his parents, his own hard work and outside financing. Farming has been a way of life for him and he has always used traditional methods to grow beans and corn. By buying and selling cattle, his goal is to have work through the summer months and to increase his earnings and increase the number of cattle he trades. Through saving part of those earnings, he will also be able to acquire the necessary capital that will allow him to be ready to invest in the farming cycle which starts again in June.\r\nMr. Basilio P\u00e9rez has secured 8 loans since 2004. He has been working with Ceprodel for the past 6 years. The loans have been very beneficial, as thanks to them he has been able to improve his working conditions and increase his earnings, thereby improving his quality of life. He has been able to provide options and better living conditions for his family, since thanks to his earnings he can cover his family\u2019s basic needs.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Montserrat Zuckerman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":485748,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy three young bulls","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Condega","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":74,"posted_date":"2010-02-10T19:20:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Basilio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":11539.44,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":11539.44}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":575}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":575,"local_amount":11539.44,"processed_date":"2010-09-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-19T08:07:37Z","rounded_local_amount":12040.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172090607,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-02-13T01:49:07Z","paid_date":"2010-10-19T08:07:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":174763,"name":"Gerardo Modesto","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"En el departamento de Chinandaga, el se\u00f1or Gerardo G. se dedica a trabajar arduamente en un centro de labores con el fin de obtener los ingresos para el beneficio propio de su familia y su casa de habitaci\u00f3n que tanto necesita de \u00e9l.\nActualmente el se\u00f1or Gerardo est\u00e1 solicitando el cr\u00e9dito para invertirlo en la compra de \u00fatiles escolares para sus dos peque\u00f1os hijos debido a que estos est\u00e1n en la escuela y \u00e9l debe de mantenerlos para que se desarrollen y lleguen a ser grandes profesionales.\nEspera confiadamente que el cr\u00e9dito ser\u00e1 otorgado y a lo inmediato comprar\u00e1 los \u00fatiles escolares y tambi\u00e9n pagar\u00e1 la matricula de sus hijos para que estos estudien.\n","en":"Mr. Gerardo G. works very hard at a work center in the Department of Chinandanga.

His property has 12 \u201cmanzanas\u201d (1 manzana = 1.68 acres), and he uses different areas for different activities.  He uses two manzanas to grow basic grains (beans and corn) and ten manzanas to raise livestock.  He plants basic consumable grains like beans and corn and raises cattle.  That is the reason for the loan.  He will buy two small bulls to raise until they gain more weight.  He will then sell them for a better price than what he paid for them.\r\n\r\nThis client set up and started his work activity with an inheritance of five manzanas of property that his parents gave him.  He started to grow basic grains like beans and corn on that property only during the winter season.  Since he was 13 he has always done this field work.  He did this with his wife\u2019s help; she helps with other important activities in their house.  An example of a normal work day is for both of them to get up very early to prepare the tools he will take to the field.  His wife prepares the food he will take to his work.  This way they both support and help each other in their work.     \r\n\r\nHe currently continues with his agricultural and livestock activities.  He hopes to continue improving his work activity in order to be able to increase his operation all of the time.  In the winter season his primary source or way of working is farming.  In the summer he gets an alternative source of income from raising livestock.  This allows him to improve his income.\r\n\r\nThis is Ram\u00f3n Alejandro V.\u2019s first year of working with Ceprodel, and it is his first loan.  The impact and benefit that he expects for his family and himself is positive.

Within the property there are designated areas for different types of work.  There are four blocks used to cultivate basic grains like beans and corn and 16 blocks suited for the raising and herding of livestock.  He dedicates his time to growing basic grains like beans and corn, work for which Mr. P. is using this loan.  The loan requested is to buy six rolls of barbed wire to surround his property and pay for the labor.  Year after year, he enlists help during the summer to  maintain his property.\r\n\r\nSince he was 12 years old, Mr. P. has dedicated his life to agricultural work.  Working on his parents' small farm gave him a lot of experience in agriculture.  He inherited a property the size of 12 city blocks from his parents, which gave him his start.  He began planting and cultivating basic grains like beans and corn during the winter months.  Later, he bought more property so he now has 20 blocks worth, or rather, he bought 8 blocks worth of property for a total of 20 that he currently has.\r\n\r\nMr. P. worked with the help of his family: his wive and his five children who are already grown.  They helped him working in the field planting and cultivating until harvesting grains.  Currently his five sons are already married and living independently with their families.  With this investment he will realize in his farm, Mr. P. hopes to continue improving his property by securing the perimeter of his farm.  Doing so will prevent livestock from leaving his property and allow him to keep them safe and avoid their kidnapping, a crime that has increased during this current economic crisis. Because of these problems, many people--Mr. P. among them--feel the need to enclose his property to improve its security and to make internal divisions to manage his livestock better.  By doing this, Mr. P. hopes to guarantee his only form of work.  For example, when the agriculture is not well enclosed within its specific areas, the livestock are able to enter and cause damages that negatively affect the grains' harvest.  Mr. P. is taking advantage of it being summer to make these necessary improvements to his farm.

His goal is to have a larger business and open up another business site.

The members are women entrepreneurs who seek to have, and be able to offer a better quality of life for their families.  All members of the community bank have businesses selling food or selling fruit and vegetables. This bank is located in the city of Cuenca, the third largest city in Ecuador.  Cuenca is renowned for its writers and artists, architectural beauty, the 4 rivers that bathe the city, its delicious cuisine, and by the warmth of the people, who are always friendly and welcoming to local and foreign tourists. \r\n\r\nLuz R. is one of the active members of this bank, and is in her fifth term working with the Foundation.  She lives in the city Cuencana and is a 34 year old wife and mother.  She has children who are 14, 8, and 6 years of age.  Her husband is a private employee of the Graiman pottery factory.  They do not own their own home, since they live in her mother's home, but manage all their expenses independently. Luz tells us that the loans, which she has received thus far, have allowed her to catch up with her debts and invest in her own business selling fruits and grains.

She tells us that she has had this business for more than 15 years, and that she began by selling chicken meat and fruit.  She had to stop selling fruit due to the large supply in the area, and she decided then to sell prepared foods.\r\n\r\nHer work day lasts from seven in the morning until one in the afternoon.  The dishes she sells most are chicken soups and ceviche.  Agustina wants to expand her chicken meat business, but she does not have enough capital to carry out this plan, which is why she is for the first time asking Edpyme Alternativa for a loan of 1,000 soles.\r\n\r\nHer greatest desire is to acquire a moto-taxi (a motorcycle with added passenger seating) so she can continue helping with the household finances and the education of her daughters, who are studying at an area school.

This group of women live in the rural community of Corredores, Puntarenas, in the southern part of Costa Rica, located near the Panamanian border. The group members are involved in various productive economic activities including taxi driving, food sales, running a restaurant, natural medicine sales, sewing and running a corner store. The women plan to use this loan to make general investments towards the expansion of their businesses.\r\n\r\nMargarita E. A. is a 44-year-old single mother of four. She is a taxi driver and plans to use this loan to make improvements to her taxicab. Her working hours are from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. but she sometimes works longer. She spends her days driving around the streets of Corredores.\r\n\r\nMargarita\u2019s goal is to expand her business  and she hopes to secure more clients and increase revenues. She respects the fact that the most important service she can provide to her clients is punctuality. She associates the name of her group with the bible. She hopes her group will expand in the future.\r\n\r\nErica N. B. is a 21-year-old woman who runs a restaurant with her mother. With this loan, she plans to invest in the family restaurant through the purchase of fast foods, cooking ingredients and various other restaurant items. Five days a week, Erica wakes up at 8 a.m., gets to work at 10 a.m., and works until 6 p.m. Her favorite part of the job is attending to clients.\r\n\r\nErica\u00b4s goals are to improve the restaurant and to provide higher quality food products in order to expand her client base. She wants her family to be prosperous and hopes to one day own a little house. Her main obstacles are financial: the high costs of living and of products coupled with a lull in the number of people eating out (as opposed to cooking at home) has made business a challenge for Erica. Nevertheless, she remains optimistic, stating: \u00a8with strength and a positive attitude, we will overcome these obstacles.\u00a8 With respect to group dynamics, she observes that the members are part of a good group; they understand each other, help each other and are very sociable.\r\n\r\nJessica N. B. is a 23-year-old mother who sells natural medicines and cosmetics with her business partner. Though Jessica is not the owner of the business, she hopes to one day open her own business selling natural medicinal products.\r\n\r\nIn order to purchase medicines, Jessica travels roughly six hours, one way, to the capital city, San Jose. The cosmetics she sells from a catalogue by visiting potential clients in her community and offering them various items. Jessica will use this loan to purchase medicinal and cosmetic products to sell in her community. Some of her most popular items are natural products which facilitate weight loss.\r\n\r\nJessica\u00b4s aspires to finish her degree in Business Administration. She mentions the fact that the business is not her own as a limitation she must deal with.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2550,"image":{"id":485808,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","use":"To make

She is starting her fifth year of university and hopes to become a professional.  \r\n<p>\r\nHe began working as a driver for an international organization dedicated to water conservation and management.  Previously, Santos worked as a driver for a state institution.  It should be noted that Santos began working for his current employer three years ago.  He works every day, Monday through Saturday, starting at 7am.  There is no established time to go home because his workload is very heavy and sometimes requires him to work after hours to meet his deadlines.\r\n<p>\r\nSantos hopes that this loan will help his daughter complete her registration so that she can start her fifth year of college.  She has future aspirations of becoming a professional and a totally independent person.\r\n<p>\r\nSantos Alfredo L. is a native of this city, married, and has two daughters.  One is independent and the the other one is a student and still lives at home.  This is the third loan he has received within the past six years.  Santos says that with the loans he has received from CEPRODEL, he has been able to undertake a few projects on his own.  Since these projects would not be possible because of his low monthly salary, Santos says he is grateful to CEPRODEL.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

The two group members are involved in different productive economic activities including catalogue clothing and hot food sales. These women plan to use this loan to make general investments towards the expansion of their businesses. \r\n\r\nXinia Maria M. is a 33-year-old single mother of three who sells clothing items from door to door in her community. She hopes to use this loan to invest in her business: specifically, the loan will increase her working capital and allow her to purchase more products, enabling her to service more clients and expand her business.\r\n\r\nXinia travels throughout her community, offering catalogue items to potential clients. Clients peruse the catalogue and place orders through Xinia who then purchases the requested items and later delivers them to the homes of her clients. Xinia receives payment upon delivery, which is why she is applying for a loan: to fund the purchase of requested items.\r\n\r\nXinia\u00b4s goal is to sell more products and increase her base of loyal clients. She mentions as an obstacle the fact that there are many other women in her community engaged in catalogue sales: the competition for clients is fierce. \r\n\r\nMaria Isabel C. is a 45-year-old mother of five who produces hot food items such as tamales (steam-cooked corn dough wrapped in banana leaves) and empanadas (stuffed bread or pastry).

He wants to enroll his children so that they do not have any difficulty starting the school year.  He will also take part of the money so that his wife can work in her business selling basic grains.  His wife works selling potatoes in a van.\r\n\r\nPedro is a workman for the Catholic Agricultural University of Tr\u00f3pico Seco (UCATSE).

They go to school and are currently in the primary grades.  His parents do not live with him, but he continues to look after them.\r\n\r\nThis is Pedro\u2019s first loan.  He says that he will remain grateful to Ceprodel for the help they are offering him.  It will help him solve the problems he now has.  It is the first time that he has contracted a debt, and he expects to do well in order to keep working and not mar his credit record.  That way he will make a good impression with Ceprodel, and they will continue taking care of him in the same manner in the future.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

She now lives in her home and rents some of the rooms, which has allowed her to be self-sufficient.  Now, she has come to know that she cannot stop the momentum and needs to continue with the repairs\/finishes of her home.

The money she asks for now will be invested in purchasing kitchen implements and a new grain grinding machine, since the one she has is very worn.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Cecilia Piris, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":485858,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase of kitchen implements and a new grain grinder","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-02-10T22:40:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ymelda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":147.62},{"due_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":158.39},{"due_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":160.79},{"due_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":170.97},{"due_date":"2010-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":177.3},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":184.93}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.43},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.28},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.84},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.05},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.73}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":51.67,"local_amount":147.62,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:26Z","rounded_local_amount":148.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123960357,"comment":null},{"amount":55.43,"local_amount":158.39,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:19Z","rounded_local_amount":159.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128993212,"comment":null},{"amount":56.28,"local_amount":160.79,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:38:22Z","rounded_local_amount":161.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717994,"comment":null},{"amount":59.84,"local_amount":170.97,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:54Z","rounded_local_amount":171.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751671,"comment":null},{"amount":62.05,"local_amount":177.3,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:03:21Z","rounded_local_amount":178.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151934136,"comment":null},{"amount":64.73,"local_amount":184.93,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:49Z","rounded_local_amount":185.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159672910,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-02-11T18:11:53Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":174825,"name":"In\u00e9s Ver\u00f3nica","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora In\u00e9s M.

She is a widow of 74 years of age and has 7 independent children. This bank member completed her primary education. <p>\r\nElena has spent about 5 years working as a seamstress and crochet maker. Little by little she was able to generate her own income and to save her money. Her business is located in her own home in a comfortable place where she can attend to her customers. She repairs blouses and dresses, and also crochets baby clothes, tablecloths, etc. She tells us that she is doing very well and has advance orders from her customers. With her first loan of 300 Soles, she bought fabric in different colors and sizes and she invested part of the money in wool yarns of different types for her crochet. <p>\r\nShe is currently continuing to run her business and she has loyal customers who come daily to her house with their orders, and she attends to them personally with her characteristic kindness. <p>\r\nWith this loan of $425, she will buy cloth maD. of various fabrics by the meter, crochet tools, needles for hand- and machine-sewing, pins, buttons, and different colored threads. <p>\r\nToday, Elena feels herself to be a very accomplished woman with more drive to acheive and realize her dreams.

She tells us that the idea for her business was born when one of her aunts encouraged her to start it because of her experience in preparing her food.\r\n\r\nJessica offers her customers various dishes, typical of the region, such as ceviche, potatoes in spicy cheese sauce, stuffed potatoes, corn tortillas, and noodles.  She runs that business daily from 9:00 am to 2:00 pm and in the evenings she sells fruit juices from the same location.\r\n\r\nShe always has many customers. She would like to expand, so she has seen fit to request a 1000 PEN ($350) loan through \u201cEdpyme Alternativa.\u201d  She will use the money to invest in dishes and a new canopy in order to improve

Bertha has been making clothes for 13 years and little by little has generated income and saved her money. Previously she had maD. a living selling groceries. Since she had the talent for sewing, she didn't hesitate to start doing it for a living, and with the help of Kiva partner Movimiento Manuela Ramos she decided to start her own sewing shop out of her home. She tells us that the business is going very well, and she works on orders that her clients request in advance. She tends to her customers with the friendliness and charisma that she is known for. With her initial loan of 300 soles, she purchased meters of fabric, threads of different colors, and other odds and ends, and has continued with the business ever since. With the current loan of 3,000 soles she is requesting, she plans to purchase meters of fabric of different styles and colors, scissors, big spools of threads of various colors, sewing needles, pins and buttons. Today she feels like a very accomplished woman with a strong desire to keep moving forward and realizing her dreams.

She is 38 years old. Jennifer is the group leader of a 30-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jennifer is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Jennifer owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector running a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food and daily-use products in the local community. Jennifer has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 3000 PHP a month for these activities.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2009, Jennifer joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Jennifer is requesting a new loan of 6000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Jennifer from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>About ASKI:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>ASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.<\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3225,"image":{"id":485294,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase additional products to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Nagrumbuan,Cauayan City,Isabela","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":123,"posted_date":"2010-02-10T06:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jennifer","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Richard","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Elvira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fredelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ma.

She is 32 years old and is the group leader of a two-member group loan offered by GDMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are both collectively responsible for paying back the loan of their fellow group member if they are delinquent or default.\r\n\r\nNaomi is married and has three school-aged children. She owns and operates a \"sari-sari\u201d (general) store, selling daily-use products such as shampoo, coffee, Milo (a milk drink), eggs, sugar, salt, etc., in the local community. She has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Naomi joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from GDMPC.\r\n\r\nNaomi is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be her second from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About GDMPC:<\/b>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

They believe that proceeds from this business will give them money to support the immediate needs of their family.\r\n\r\nSonia hopes that her business will become successful someday. Along with the winning business, she is dreaming about seeing her five children graduate from college and find a stable job.

She is 60 years old. Rosita is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Rosita owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector running a general store. The main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Rosita has been engaged in her business for over four years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month for these activities.\n\nIn 2009, Rosita joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Rosita has successfully repaid a previous loan from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Rosita is requesting a new loan of 13,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Rosita from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the borrower's business. \n\nAbout ASKI:\n\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

A. is from the village of Minaog, Dipolog City but she operates her business in Poblacion, La Libertad, Zamboanga del Norte. She is 57 years-old and married with one adult child. To make a living, Jelina owns and operates a general store selling a variety of grocery products.  She also sells soft drinks in the local community. Jelina has been engaged in her business for over four years and earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Jelina joined Kiva partner PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Jelina has successfully repaid a previous loan of 50,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional inventory and working capital. Jelina is requesting a new loan of 50,000 PHP which will be used as additional working capital for her soft drink selling business. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Jelina from PMPC and through Kiva. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand the business. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

N. has been engaged in this business for over two years and earns approximately 3,000,000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2008, N. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. N. has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4,256,000 VND from SEDA. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. She is now requesting a new loan of 6,496,000 VND which will also be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be her third loan from SEDA. N. plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve and expand her business.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout the Other Borrowers in the Group:\r\n<p>\r\n1.  Tr\u1ea7n Th\u1ecb C.

She also runs a variety store as a secondary business to earn more income.\r\n\r\nNow on her second loan, she requests 10,000 PHP to continue the primary business, fishing. The loan fund will be used to pay for fishing equipment like rope, bamboo, fish nets, and the cost of labor for 3 persons to work for 2 days.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Lilia wants to invest in more fish cages to raise more fish and meet the growing demands in their village.

She is the mother of a 4-year-old child, Ian Roy. She is married to a fisherman, Modesto, who is 40 years old.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Victoria joined ASHI (Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and Kiva partner in the Philippines.

V. is a 68-year-old widow from Jala-jala, Rizal Province, in the Philippines. She has given birth to an only son, Joey V., who is a 39-year-old fisherman. At her older age and being a widow is not easy for her to face the difficulty of poverty, but through the support of ASHI in her life, she has never felt alone in achieving her dreams.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1992, Beticia joined the KIVA partner and MFI, Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc. (ASHI), which means \u201dTo rise up from poverty\u201d. When she received her previous loans, she invested the money in selling detergent and soap bars, and she hopes to expand her business soon by purchasing more stock. Now on her 6th loan, she has requested 25,000 PHP as additional capital for her primary business of selling detergent and soap, while she tends to a fishing business at the same time.\r\n\r\n\r\nShe is optimistic that both businesses will grow because she already has regular customers requesting orders from her.\r\n\r\n\r\nShe dreams of having a space in the market where she can sell her detergent and soap bars, and more fish from her fishing business. She also dreams of building a durable, concrete house and having successful businesses that can provide them a good life that is far away from poverty.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":486069,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products

G. is a 60-year-old married woman who lives in Brgy. Miranda, Bolobitoon, Hinigaran City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living through her eatery and general store.\r\n\r\nDemocrita\u2019s husband Ernesto helps her run the business. They have six children who are between the ages of 19 and 32. Some of their children have their own work, and one child is currently going to school.\r\n\r\nDemocrita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve the quality of life of their family. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD she has been able to increase their family income by engaging in her eatery and general store business. Now she earns an average monthly income of $175 from her business activities.\r\n\r\nDemocrita is a member of good standing. Her previous loan of 19,500 PHP, which was also funded by Kiva lenders, was used to fund the operations of her eatery and general store business, and it had a positive impact on both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is taking out her 16th loan, in the amount of 23,000 PHP, which she intends to use on her business. Democrita is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which is to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":485955,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She is a woman of strong faith to conquer all challenges to achieve her dreams. \r\n\r\nIn 2006, Gloria joined ASHI (Ahon sa Hirap Inc.) a micro-finance institution and Kiva partner in the Philippines. As a member of the Institution for almost four years, she has shown an excellent performance in her credit rating (the basis of loans) and therefore she has been trusted by ASHI to obtain several loans.\r\n\r\nGloria has operated a variety store for almost five years but, because of insufficient income from her retailing of small goods and her husband\u2019s earnings, the couple has decided to start a fishing business. She is requesting a new loan of PHP 20,000 to purchase fiberglass, fishing net, materials for the boat, and to pay transportation expenses.\r\n\r\nEngaging in this kind of business will help to provide additional proceeds to give the best of life to Gloria\u2019s family and develop their standard of living.\r\n\r\nGloria dreams of growing her variety store into a mini-grocery store and expanding it in their barangay (village). \u2028She also dreams of owning more fish cages to raise more fish to sell. She hopes that both businesses will be the source of stable income to sustain the needs of her family and to send her two children to school until they complete a degree.\r\n\r\nGloria\u2019s greatest

She noticed that the rivers have dried up and that everything has changed since her childhood.\r\n\r\nMs. O. wants to use energy efficient fuel to reduce her own pollution. She is extremely happy with the fuel and believes that she has saved 50% of her fuel costs. \r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About XacBank Eco Products Program:<\/b>\r\nUlaanbaatar is the coldest capital in the world. Winter temperatures can average -20 Celsius. Sixty percent of the city population live in tents called gers, with wooden frames covered by layers of wool felt. On average, households located in the Ger Districts use 5 tons of coal and 1.5 tons of wood per year. Sixty percent of the pollution in the city during the heating season is attributed to coal burned in the Ger Districts. The bottom fifth spend as much as 40% of their monthly winter income on heating fuels.\r\n\r\nXacBank has worked with MicroEnergy Credits to launch a line of eco-products consisting of energy efficient stoves and ger blankets, which will reduce energy

This is done largely to prevent spoilage and to extend the storage life of the grain).\r\n\r\nAlthough they try to work hard, this family earns less income than needed.

Winter temperatures can average -20 Celsius. Sixty percent of the city population live in tents called gers, with wooden frames covered by layers of wool felt. On average, households located in the Ger Districts use 5 tons of coal and 1.5 tons of wood per year. Sixty percent of the pollution in the city during the heating season is attributed to coal burned in the Ger Districts. The bottom fifth spend as much as 40% of their monthly winter income on heating fuels.\r\n\r\nXacBank has worked with MicroEnergy Credits to launch a line of eco-products consisting of energy efficient stoves and ger blankets, which will reduce energy consumption.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":485985,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal Use","use":"To buy an energy-efficient heating stove","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MN","country":"Mongolia","town":"Ulaanbaatar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"47.916667 106.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":116,"posted_date":"2010-02-10T15:40:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ankbaatar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MNT","disbursal_amount":600000,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":46273},{"due_date":"2010-03-14T08:00:00Z","amount":46919.55},{"due_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":47575.14},{"due_date":"2010-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":48239.89},{"due_date":"2010-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":48913.93},{"due_date":"2010-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":49597.38},{"due_date":"2010-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":50290.39},{"due_date":"2010-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":50993.07},{"due_date":"2010-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":51705.58},{"due_date":"2010-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":52428.04},{"due_date":"2010-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":53160.6},{"due_date":"2011-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":53903.43}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.78},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.23},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.7},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.17},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.65},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.13},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.62},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.12},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.63},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.13},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.66},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.18}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":35.5,"local_amount":50116,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:37:02Z","rounded_local_amount":51562.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":124012013,"comment":null},{"amount":35.36,"local_amount":49920,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T10:19:28Z","rounded_local_amount":51360.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129041075,"comment":null},{"amount":35.62,"local_amount":50281,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:38:50Z","rounded_local_amount":51731.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136763613,"comment":null},{"amount":35.31,"local_amount":49843,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:18:20Z","rounded_local_amount":51281.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144795169,"comment":null},{"amount":35.31,"local_amount":49846,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:28:19Z","rounded_local_amount":51284.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151975693,"comment":null},{"amount":247.9,"local_amount":349994,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:20:03Z","rounded_local_amount":360092.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159713071,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-02-11T03:20:25Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T12:20:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":174945,"name":"Erlinda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Erlinda A. is a 58-year-old married woman who lives in Habitat 4, Barangay Bajumpandan, Dumaguete City, Negros Oriental.

Marissa has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from ASKI. Marissa is requesting a new loan, her second, which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to save as a reserve for future emergencies. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

He has one child, age 6, who currently attends school. He is a farmer in the South Rift Valley, near Litein, Kenya, and has two employees currently working for him. He's been farming for over nine years and sells milk, eggs, pineapples, maize, and tea. In addition to his farm, Peter also owns and helps run a medical clinic. He says that the main challenges to his farming business are the expensive farm inputs and feeds, and that markets are sometimes not available for his produce.\r\n\r\nPeter requested this loan through Juhudi Kilimo for KES 65,000 to purchase a dairy cow.

He repaid his first loan well and on time and with this current loan he plans to buy leather for making more shoes which he will display and sell later for a profit to his clients.\r\n\r\nHis future dream is to move to a permanent shop and stop working from the roadside. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":486145,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cobbler","sector":"Services","use":"To buy leather for making new shoes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Naivasha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.716667 36.433333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":133,"posted_date":"2010-02-10T17:00:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julius ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1667},{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1667},{"due_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1667},{"due_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1667},{"due_date":"2010-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1667},{"due_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1667},{"due_date":"2010-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1667},{"due_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1667},{"due_date":"2010-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1667},{"due_date":"2010-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1667},{"due_date":"2011-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1667},{"due_date":"2011-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1663}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.93},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":45.84,"local_amount":3334,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:22:22Z","rounded_local_amount":3511.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128976965,"comment":null},{"amount":22.92,"local_amount":1667,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-16T08:24:29Z","rounded_local_amount":1755.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144885496,"comment":null},{"amount":45.85,"local_amount":3334,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-19T09:11:07Z","rounded_local_amount":3511.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":160095693,"comment":null},{"amount":22.92,"local_amount":1667,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:34:13Z","rounded_local_amount":1755.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166876940,"comment":null},{"amount":22.92,"local_amount":1667,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:19:58Z","rounded_local_amount":1755.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172144010,"comment":null},{"amount":22.92,"local_amount":1667,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:00:04Z","rounded_local_amount":1755.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177438873,"comment":null},{"amount":22.92,"local_amount":1667,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:42:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1755.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182578238,"comment":null},{"amount":22.92,"local_amount":1667,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:50:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1755.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188713497,"comment":null},{"amount":22.92,"local_amount":1667,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:24:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1755.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191451837,"comment":null},{"amount":22.87,"local_amount":1663,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:00:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1751.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195874089,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-02-10T20:07:03Z","paid_date":"2011-03-15T12:00:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":175032,"name":"Kiden","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kiden A. is currently in the business of selling groundnuts paste and charcoal at the market and is requesting a loan to stock more bags of charcoal to sell.
