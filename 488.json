L.  lives with his wife and teenage daughter in an apartment in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. His wife works in a hotel while his only daughter attends a local high school.  The family rents an apartment with monthly fees of 250,000 MNT and pays the rent every 6 months. Myagmardorj used to work in his brother's vacuum window making company and in 2004, he decided to operate his own window-making business with the help of his friend, in a rented workplace, renting the necessary equipment. \r\n\r\nAfter years of operation, they were able to buy their own tools and equipment and run their business which however stopped in 2009 due to high rental cost. After that, Myagmardorj  purchased a container space in Narantuul, the biggest market in the city, where he operates a luggage-storing business. He has built up a stable and successful operation within this short period. Over the year of operation, his earnings have enabled him to live in a rented apartment after previously living in a 'ger', a traditional Mongolian nomadic home tent, in his brother's yard. \r\n\r\nMyagmardorj is a modest and helpful man . He is requesting a 3,000,000 MNT loan to expand his business type by returning to his previous vacuum window-producing business.

She is married to A. A. who is a cobbler by profession. He makes shoes on order for different shoe factories. Those factories provide him raw materials for making shoes but in this way he only earns the laboring cost, which is not enough to meet the expenses of his family. That is why he has decided to buy the raw materials for himself and start to sell the finished products to these factories. In this way he can make more money and improve the financial situation of his family. \r\n\r\nTherefore, Farzana has applied for a loan from Kiva partner, Asasah, for her husband. He will invest the loan in purchasing raw materials such as nails, leather, shoe polish, etc. in bulk that will enable him to make shoes in larger quantity to sell to the factories. \r\n\r\nFarzana is hopeful that by utilizing the loan money, her husband\u2019s income will be increased and she will be able to provide better living facilities to her large family of 8 children.   Both of her sons do labor and her daughters stay at home. She is a regular loan user of Asasah and this is her 2nd loan application.

has a sari-sari store business. Her husband\u2019s support of this business is Lorena\u2019s inspiration to persevere through the test of poverty to grow her business despite her circumstances. Sari-sari stores basically sell small quantities of various foodstuffs, groceries and beverages. \u201cSari\u201d is a native word for variety. These small stores are either attached to the owner\u2019s house or in a small native cottage not far from the owner\u2019s home. Such stores are convenient for people in the barangay (village) who live far from the marketplace or town.\r\n<br>This kind of business has brought pleasure to Lorena\u2019s family. With its profits, she has been able to support her family\u2019s need. Being a good mother, Lorena always wanted to support her three children in whatever career they would choose to better their personal life. Aside from Lorena\u2019s variety store business financed by the loan she received from Kiva partner, ASHI, she also has a buy and sell business, which is her way of saving profits to support her family's needs, especially her children\u2019s education until college. With this in mind, Lorena is requesting a loan from Kiva lenders to purchase grocery items for her store and support her buy and sell business. This loan will help her businesses grow and make more profit, which will enable her to support her ambitions in life.\r\n<br>Lorena has been an ASHI member since 2004. Her family is very thankful that she has an opportunity to improve her living conditions through the income of her two businesses, both of which she has established with the support of previous loans. Her long-term goals are to have passenger jeepney (small bus) for added income, expand to a fully fledged grocery store, and give her children a better future. These dreams fuel her to continue her dedication to her

60-year-old, business-minded woman, Teodora hopes and dreams that some day her charcoal business will expand. Through the loan she is requesting from Kiva through ASHI, she will be able to increase her inventory of charcoal. Charcoal is the most common fuel for cooking food for the poor people living in very remote areas of the province. Aside from its affordable price, it is also the most conveniently accessed commodity for people in remote villages. Proceeds from her business will help Teodora achieve her goal of helping her two remaining children complete college and become successful, just like her eldest son Elmer who is now a teacher. She also hopes they will have a beautiful concrete house of their own to live in.\r\n<p>\r\nAs a dedicated member since 1999 of Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc. (ASHI), a Kiva microfinance partner in the Philippines, Teodora is thankful for receiving capital and loans to support her business dreams.

She has been making cloth dolls, paintings on wood and decoupage for the past 10 years.  For the past 2 years she has had a site at the market in Talca, which was unfortunately destroyed in the earthquake that occurred this past February 27th.  For this reason, she now only sells her products from her home or door-to-door.\r\n\r\nShe will use this loan to buy cotton and used fabrics to make her dolls.  In November, she will open a locale located in a new gallery, where she will work with her mother\u2019s help as she also participates in Fondo Esperanza and is in the same business as Paula.  Her goal is to have her handicrafts recognized for their quality and originality.\r\n\r\nShe has 2 daughters, ages 18 and 15, who live with her.

The majority of the population is involved in agricultural economic activities.  The area is known for its beautiful handicrafts and its colonial architecture.  The principal attractions are the flora, fauna, and vineyards.

They have three daughters: Paulina is 15 and attends a three-year pre-university course, Brenda is 13 and attends high school, and Anais is 11 and goes to elementary school. Ms Juana Alicia has a food business; she sells pies, pozole (stew made with pork or chicken and corn), soft drinks, tostadas (fried corn pancakes) and dobladas. She applies for a loan to buy baking mixture, frozen meat, red meat, disposable glasses, plates and spoons to stock up her business. She started her business a year ago for economic reasons. She rented her premises within walking distance from her home, one and a half blocks away. Her business is important to her because she feels useful, has an income and learns to be independent. She loves to cook and gets a lot of satisfaction from preparing dishes for visiting people who can enjoy a tasty meal. She is proud that her business gives her all the necessary resources to provide for her daughters. Her daughters help her to prepare the dishes; the eldest girl attends school in the afternoon and the younger one in the morning. Her customers are all kinds of people, boys and girls, men and women, all in all she serves 30 to 40 customers a day. The earnings are used to invest in necessary ingredients, repay her loan and save some money. Her business helped her when she faced economic challenges, because she was able to pay for the girls' school and other expenses when her husband had no work. Her dream for the future is to expand her business and offer a greater variety of dishes. Ms Juana Alicia is very happy with the granted loan because it helps her to pay for what she needs. The improvement she wants to achieve is that her daughters become professionals and that she can invest in more food and earn an income from her work.\r\n\r\nThe residents of Jaloxtoc are nice and very quiet, there are no crimes and people love to help each other. The group members want to say to Kiva and Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad: \"Thank you, and please keep on helping us with more loans. We are grateful for your trust.\"\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1800,"image":{"id":630216,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase baking mixture, frozen meat, red meat, disposable glasses, plates and spoons to stock up her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"JALOXTOC, AYALA; MORELOS","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2010-11-06T15:10:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1800,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Angela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana Alicia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sara ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Valentina Silvia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Estela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-10-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":22000,"loan_amount":1800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2010-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2010-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2010-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2010-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2011-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2011-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2011-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":675,"local_amount":8250,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:16:06Z","rounded_local_amount":8329.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182554998,"comment":null},{"amount":450,"local_amount":5500,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:17:36Z","rounded_local_amount":5553.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188691488,"comment":null},{"amount":450,"local_amount":5500,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:44:32Z","rounded_local_amount":5553.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191430672,"comment":null},{"amount":225,"local_amount":2750,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:45:01Z","rounded_local_amount":2776.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195849949,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-11-08T13:42:24Z","paid_date":"2011-03-15T11:45:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":244771,"name":"Oscar Leonel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Oscar Leonel tiene 44 a\u00f1os, su actividad es brindar el servicio de transporte Hace m\u00e1s de 10 a\u00f1os.

It is located in San Pedro neighborhood in Acteopan, in the state of Puebla, Mexico.  It has 5 female members who know each other and are neighbors.  Mrs Irene C. A. is the group's representative.  She is 63 years old and didn't go to school.  She has 5 children: Minerva who is 28; \u00c1ngeles, 38; Santos Mario, 27; Sim\u00f3n, 25 (a potter who makes earthenware cooking pots and jugs) and Luis Yovani, 14 (who is at high school and also helps serve customers, put clay in bags and sell it by the kilo).\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are:\r\n\r\n** Petra A. M. who will use her loan to buy clay to make cooking pots to then sell them unfired.\r\n** Jorgina B. T. who will buy firewood to fire the earthenware because she has none left.\r\n** Margarita M. V. who will buy firewood, white clay and clay to make earthenware pots and jugs.\r\n** Mar\u00eda Myriam Guzm\u00e1n C. who will buy oil, sugar, rice, sweets, juice etc. for her quesadilla business\r\n** Irene C. A. who will buy pots, firewood and clay to stock her business\r\n\r\nThe members of the group would like to say to Kiva and Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad \u201cMany thanks for your support and for having faith in us.  We are going to work hard so that we do not let you down\u201d.  \r\n\r\nIrene has a business buying and selling different types of clay, earthenware pots, jugs, candlesticks and decorations for the home.  She is requesting her loan to buy more of these products in order to stock her business.  She also wants to finish building her house, installing a cement roof and floor, windows and doors, and plaster the walls so that she can go round and fix it up nicely.\r\n\r\nIrene set up her business 4 years ago.  She learned about her business out of necessity.  She had children in school and she didn't have any money.  Her husband went to the United States to work but had little work.  The little money that he earned he saved.\r\n\r\nShe started off selling packages of earthenware.  She started out with 5 packages and was approached by a customer who bought it all and kept buying from her.  The family didn't spend the money but used it to keep buying and selling.  They invested the money in buying more earthenware.  The money she received from her husband in the US covered their food expenses.\r\n\r\nIrene's business is located in her house in San Marcos, in the state of Puebla.  Her business is very  important to her because it means she has money to give to her son who is studying at high school and needs books and other material.  Irene likes making earthenware pots and she also likes to buy so that she has more stock which is well displayed and so that she can provide her customers with everything they require.  She is very happy with everything that she sells. \r\n\r\nIrene's provider in Puebla sells her clay on credit, giving her 15 or 20 days to pay.  Her customers are from all over San Bartolo and Santa Maria.  They buy clay from her by the kilo and buy the pots and jugs in bulk.  Her business is popular because everybody knows her.  It has no competition.  Although everybody in San Marcos is in the pottery business, customers all know where to buy from.  Irene's profits are re-invested in buying more earthenware and clay.\r\n\r\nIrene's husband also now works.  He sells earthenware products in the market in Tenancingo in the state of Mexico and to other businesses.  Between this and the pottery store, they have money for  food and to cover household expenses.  Irene would like to expand her business, fix it up and stock it well but right now she can't because her own home isn't finished yet, so it is currently in her son's home.  She plans install a type of gallery in her store and fix the pottery store the way she wants it.  She hopes to achieve this by working and with her profits.\r\n\r\nThe 'fiestas patronales' (celebrations for the feast day of a town's patron saint) are very pretty in San Marcos. The 2nd Sunday in January is the 'Dulce Nombre de Jes\u00fas' (Sweet Name of Jesus) fiesta.  There are religious masses and 'chinelos' (traditional dances).  The 25th and 26th of April is the date for the San Marcos fiesta.\r\n\r\nIrene comments that her business has helped her to improve her family's lives.  Her dreams are to see her house finished and to set up her gallery in her store so that everything is well displayed.  She wants to stock it well and see it grow.

Oswalda posee una tienda, siendo su \u00fanica fuente de ingreso y por tal es la que m\u00e1s temprano abre para el p\u00fablico, debido a que madruga para ir al mercado mayoristas y poder abastecerse de verduras y frutas frescas para  su negocio, ya que son alimentos no perecibles y de lo que tiene mucha demanda como el pan de cada d\u00eda. A media ma\u00f1ana no le queda mercader\u00eda alguna, y eso le da mucha satisfacci\u00f3n, por lo que le resulta rentable su trabajo. Adem\u00e1s de est\u00e9 trabajo, tambi\u00e9n se dedica a vender queques y gelatinas que ella misma prepara. Lo que mas le gusta negocio, es conversar con sus clientes, adem\u00e1s tiene v\u00edveres que no logra vender lo cual lo utiliza para el men\u00fa familiar. Es as\u00ed que lleva 6 a\u00f1os en esta actividad y lo que considera m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil es cargar las bolsas de compras, ya que sufre de lumbalgia. En adelante tiene planeado construir el segundo piso de su casa. Este es su noveno cr\u00e9dito con MFP y se compromete a ser puntual con el pago de sus cuotas, para no traerle complicaciones a su banco comunal. Con el cr\u00e9dito que solicita, va comprar alimentos de primera necesidad, para que su bodega est\u00e9 provista de diversos productos y que sean del gusto de sus clientes.  \n\n","en":"Oswalda is 50 years old.  She is separated and lives with her three children in her own home.  She is very much a fighter and as a result she has managed, little by little, to build her own home.\r\n\r\nOswalda owns a store which is her sole source of income and, for that reason, hers is the store that opens earliest to the public.  She gets up very early in the morning to go to the wholesale market in order to be able to stock her business with fresh fruit and vegetables as they are perishable foods for which she has a lot of demand.  By mid morning she has no merchandise left and this makes her feel very satisfied and means that her work is very profitable.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this work, she also sells cakes and jellies (jell-o) which she makes herself.  What she likes most about her business is chatting to her customers and also the fact that the provisions which she doesn't manage to sell she uses for her family's meals.  She has been in this business for 6 years and the most difficult thing about her work is packing shopping bags since she suffers from lower back pain.  In the future she is planning to add a second level to her house.  This is her ninth loan from MFP and she pledges to be punctual in her repayments in order to avoid making things difficult for her community bank.  She will use the loan that she is requesting to buy basic foodstuffs so that her store is stocked with a range of products which will please her customers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":632630,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy

M. lives in the city of Cartagena in the Emmanuel housing development where she has a business selling footwear, casual clothes and bags.  She is married and has two children aged 3 and 7.  She started her business when she became unemployed with her severance pay.  She began to obtain goods and offer them initially to her friends and family members.  She was then able to add people who these customers referred and, in this way, her business has been gradually growing.  As she was very limited in her ability to respond to her customers and the orders that they were making, she began her loan process with la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  This Kiva loan is her second loan.  She plans to invest it in buying merchandise and increase her sales by 25%.  Maryoris' business has been very useful because once she lost her job she created her own work from her small business.  Day by day she works hard and also studies hard to complete her university course in languages because her dream is to have a school and educate the community bearing in mind that teaching is her great potential.  In this end-of-year season, her profits will rise because this is a period of the year which sees a great rise in sales and Maryoris knows very well how to take advantage of it owing to her business experience and her family's support which fills her with a lot of happiness and desire to get ahead so that her children's future becomes bright.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":702.54,"image":{"id":630352,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To

The Transcripe, a massive transport system, is being planned for this city.  She lives with her husband and their two children, ages 17 and 19.\r\n\r\nNubis is a regular member of the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She started her connection with the communal bank in 1995.  Initially she sold liquor, but her business was gradually changing until it became a large business selling a variety of items. This was the goal that Nubis had when she started the business.\r\n\r\nEver since undertaking the business her life has taken a great turn, especially with the support received from this organization.  When she started she had no experience.  The training and the orientations from the professionals with the organization have helped her get ahead.  The unconditional support of her family and neighbors also helped.  Now she is well known. There is a good demand for her products in the market.  This income is important given that there is a lot of competition in the neighborhood.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to greatly expand the infrastructure of her business.  She also dreams of always being well-stocked with what her customers need.  Her greatest challenge is when sales are down and she needs to fall back on selling products by catalog in order to make it through these times.\r\n\r\nShe is currently requesting a loan from Kiva to buy varied merchandise like jewelry, hair accessories for women, gift items, stationery items, and packaging goods.  She plans to have these items available to sell at the end of this year.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":630416,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy

Like all single mothers, she works to care for her daughter, Dennis, of 4 years, who she takes care of and educates in her parents house; located in the rural area of Santa Clara. Her main aspiration is to build her own house, so that she can provide the commodities necessary for her small daughter. Because of this, she works eagerly every morning on her crops. She has worked in agriculture for 3 years, the potato crop being her main activity so that different varieties of the same crop can be sold throughout the year without \"major difficulties\", she says. However, this is not all Flor does, she also cares for 3 cows of good breed, which give enough milk to prepare \"cheese\", which is later sold at a good price from local villagers. This is her fifth loan with MFP, and seeing the progress she has had thanks to the community bank, she advised her brother to do the same so that he can, like her, get ahead. With the loan she receives, she will buy fertilizer and a variety of \"\u00fanica\" potato seeds, with this she believes she can supply her production for the approaching agriculture season.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":632815,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy potato seeds and fertilizer for her next harvest.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-11-05T18:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Flor ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-10-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":725,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:32:46Z","rounded_local_amount":2028.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206195669,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-11-05T19:21:01Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T11:32:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":244835,"name":"Rolin","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Rolin, de 21 a\u00f1os, es un hombre, que a pesar de los inconvenientes que tiene, lucha por salir adelante. \u00c9l, convive con Dora de 25 a\u00f1os, con la que tuvo un hijo; Jean Pier, de 11 meses de edad, al que cuidan con mucho amor en una casa arrendada, ubicada en la localidad de Santa Clara.

She earns her living by operating one business venture: a used clothing  business.  Her husband Alfredo P., who is 53 years old, works as a driver to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have 6 children who are between 23 and 29 years old. \r\n\r\nGina joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1999 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 18 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Gina has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 29,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 15,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 19th loan, she is borrowing PHP 30,000, which she intends to use to buy more used clothes to sell so that she can continue to save up for future home repairs. Gina P. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\n In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Eva joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past five loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Ma. Eva has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 1500, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 6th loan, she is borrowing PHP 12,000, which she intends to use as extra capital for her business operation so that she can continue to save up for future education of her children. \r\n\r\nMa.

T. is 43-year-old married woman and supports her family by operating one business venture: buying and selling household appliances. She lives in Purok Doridad, Brgy Plaridel, Sagay City, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2004 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. \r\n\r\nBy working hard in her buying and selling of household appliances, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 4000. Leah is now borrowing PHP 21,000 to use as additional working capital for the business.  This will be her 11th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 19,500, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Leah aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4500 PHP from PMPC. She is now requesting a new loan of 4000 PHP which will be used to add to her capital for their recycling business. This will be her 7th loan from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family and as savings for future use, especially for future business expansion.\r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model. \r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

C. is a married woman who lives in Prk.

Her husband Venicio C., who is 52 years old, works as an NGO employee to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have eight children who are between 1 and 20 years old; 5 of their children are currently going to school. \r\n\r\nAnnie joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 16 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Annie has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 23,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 17th loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000, which she intends to use as additional capital for her business so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. \r\n\r\nAnnie C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

Her husband Reynaldo A., who is 52 years old, is a government employee and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have three children who are between 3 and 16 years old; all of them are currently going to school. \r\n\r\nMa. Imelda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 6 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Ma. Imelda has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 22,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 25,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 7th loan, she is borrowing PHP 26,000, which she intends to use to pay for more stock so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. \r\n\r\nMa.

S. is 53 years old, married, and supports her family by operating one business venture: buying and selling 'chicharon' (pork rinds) and plastics bags.  She lives in Bliss, Brgy. La Paz, Bogo, Cebu. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2008 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. \r\n\r\nBy working hard in her 'chicharon' (pork rinds) & plastics bag business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 10,000. Epefania is now borrowing PHP 20,000 so that she can continue to purchase more stock of plastic bags and 'chicharon'  to sell.   This will be her 6th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 14,500, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. \r\n\r\nEpefania aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the  Dungganon way.\r\n\r\n About NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

With the rest of the loan she would buy more groceries to support her business activities. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1450,"image":{"id":632911,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"To add to her savings to fix her house","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":109,"posted_date":"2010-11-03T17:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Prom","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mom","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Heng","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mean","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Poch","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Keit","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-10-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":6000000,"loan_amount":1450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":585800},{"due_date":"2010-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":585800},{"due_date":"2010-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":585800},{"due_date":"2011-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":585800},{"due_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":585800},{"due_date":"2011-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":585800},{"due_date":"2011-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":585800},{"due_date":"2011-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":585800},{"due_date":"2011-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":585800},{"due_date":"2011-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":585800},{"due_date":"2011-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":142000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":141.57},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":141.57},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":141.57},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":141.56},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.57},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.57},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.57},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.57},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.57},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.56},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.32}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":241.76,"local_amount":1000400,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T12:33:05Z","rounded_local_amount":1017823.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182487243,"comment":null},{"amount":120.88,"local_amount":500200,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:01:29Z","rounded_local_amount":508911.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188622030,"comment":null},{"amount":120.88,"local_amount":500200,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T01:22:53Z","rounded_local_amount":508911.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191365119,"comment":null},{"amount":120.88,"local_amount":500200,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-16T08:26:43Z","rounded_local_amount":508911.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195958699,"comment":null},{"amount":120.88,"local_amount":500200,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-17T07:59:23Z","rounded_local_amount":508911.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201509834,"comment":null},{"amount":120.88,"local_amount":500200,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:07:21Z","rounded_local_amount":508911.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206092349,"comment":null},{"amount":120.88,"local_amount":500200,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-07T08:04:13Z","rounded_local_amount":508911.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211163129,"comment":null},{"amount":307.08,"local_amount":1270600,"processed_date":"2011-06-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-29T07:41:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1292729.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216446183,"comment":null},{"amount":175.88,"local_amount":727800,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-27T07:50:55Z","rounded_local_amount":740475.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227504714,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-11-18T13:23:46Z","paid_date":"2011-09-27T07:50:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":244875,"name":"Liwanag","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Since joining ASHI, Liwanag B. has ventured into selling fish and a fishing business. The idea of having this kind of business crossed her mind when her husband who is also fisherman caught more fish in the lake, located in Talim Island, in the province of Rizal. Liwanag sold those in their neighborhood and she realized that selling fish earns profits bigger and faster than any other kind of business she had had in the past years of her life using her loan from ASHI. Unlike other products sold, fish is salable because it is one of the most basic needs of the human being, especially for people who live in very remote areas of the province. They are far from the municipal market thus the possibility of buying from vendors who come to their community is very high. Also, most people choose to buy fish rather than any other meat because it is cheaper and healthier.\r\n\r\nFrom then on, Liwanag used her loans from ASHI in her fishing business. From the profits she earned, she was able to invest in her home and support her family financially, specially the tuition fees of her five children which are very expensive. \r\n\r\nShe kept on borrowing from ASHI to keep her business growing. Now, she plans to use her newly received loan in buying additional materials needed for her fishing business such as fishing nets and other supplies so that her husband will catch more fish to sell. If ever the couple gets better output, they will be able to invest more in their home.\r\n\r\nHer greatest dreams are for her four younger children to attain a degree, just like her eldest child, Raynan, who graduated from computer courses and has a successful job with the coastguard. Education is wealth that other people can\u2019t steal. The couple believes that education is the only inheritance they can offer their children. To make this happen, they help each other in order for them to achieve their dreams of giving their children the best in life.

P. is a married woman who lives in Bliss, Brgy. La Paz, Bogo City, Cebu. She earns her living by operating one business venture: a general store  business.  Her husband Celso P., who is 53 years old, works as a driver to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have three children who are 14 to 21 years old. One child already works and helps support the family and the other two children are currently going to school. \r\n\r\nVicenta joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past five loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Vicenta has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 14,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000,  uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 6th loan, she is borrowing PHP 20,000, which she intends to use to buy more stock for the general store so that she can continue to save up for future education of her children. Vicenta P. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\n In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

He receives orders from different factories and shoe shops and provides them with finished goods to earn an income. \r\n<br>Sughran has applied for a loan from Kiva partner, Asasah, for her embroidery business. With the loan, she will buy embroidery materials such as beads, colored thread, fabric and sketches that will help her to finish orders on time and offer more variety to her customers. She is a new loan user of Asasah and this is her first loan application.

Instead of letting herself be trapped by her insecurities, in 2008 Nelia joined Kiva partner, ASHI, in order to access a loan to allow her productive side to flourish. With previous loans, Nelia has developed a fishing business. Her profits augment her husband\u2019s income as a fisherman and vendor. When her profits grow, she will be able to support her children\u2019s education until they finish college. At that time, her role as a mother will be rewarded. \r\n<br>Nelia's relationship with ASHI and the loans she has taken since she became a member have helped her in running her business. Nelia has a solid repayment record, attendance record and business rating (credit rating), and this has qualified her for a higher loan amount. She is requesting a new loan to maintain her business by purchasing additional fish cages (fish traps) to catch more fish to sell in her neighborhood and nearby village.\r\n<br>Nelia's long-term goals are to expand her fishing business into a fish farm and give her children a brighter hope. She also hopes to provide other needs in order to enjoy the gifts of life that are full of blessing from almighty God and support from the good hearts of Kiva

B. has been dedicated since she\u2019s obtained working capital to engage in her hog-fattening business. Presently, Shirley relies on this activity to cover her personal costs and help sustain her family. Shirley buys piglets from her neighbors, raises them, and when they have reached a good point of development, she sells them to business people who visit the village, either alive or slaughtered for their meat to be sold per kilo. This activity is very common in their place and many entrepreneurs do this.\r\n\r\nShirley wishes to expand her business by buying more piglets, vitamins and feed for piglets, in order to forge ahead with her business and be able to help her family to get ahead.
