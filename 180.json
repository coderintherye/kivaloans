With his strong desire to revive the business,  Francisco used  his skills, expertise, and effort to make such business back in operation -- this time on his own. He joined the HSPFI microfinance program and was granted a first loan amounting to PHP 5,000 to procure materials needed for hollow-block fabrication.

Her husband, Mr. Noy Soklun, is a palm juice collector who gathers it to process into palm sugar. To make palm sugar, Mr. Noy Soklun needs firewood to burn palm juice into palm sugar. Mrs. Sopheap H. has decided to request a loan to purchase firewood for this purpose.

They are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK\u2019s main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time.

Since her business is doing well, she would like to expand it and has decided to ask for a loan to buy two more piglets for breeding to earn more income. Her husband, Mr. Nuo Pin, is a farmer who owns a plot of land and cultivates rice. Mrs. Vanna S. has three children, two of whom are enrolled in the local school while the youngest one is too young to work or study.  Mrs. Chheng Chhun who is a group guarantee is presented in the picture with the village bank members.<p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ten members in this group loans are end-of-term loans and the rest have monthly payment loans. They are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK\u2019s main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time.

Even though Mrs. Yat P.\u2019s family members have different careers, they still cannot provide a better house for their family. Thus, Mrs. Yat P. has decided to request a loan to add to her savings to build a better house for her family.<p>\r\n\r\n<p>Five members in this group loan are end-of-term loans and the rest have monthly payment loans. They are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK\u2019s main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time.

is engaged in the hog raising business.

Two of their children are still studying, one in college and one is taking vocational courses. Ofelia said that they have a relatively good family situation and they are facing every challenge without complaints, as God is always there for her.\r\n <p>\r\nThrough the remittance of her husband, Ofelia was able to start hog raising business. This is her way of helping her husband in providing the educational needs of their children and household needs. Ofelia and her children dislike being away from her husband and this is her reason for having a small business--to keep her busy and at the same time assist in their financial needs. She is now requesting for a loan of $75 (PHP 3,000.00) to purchase feed for her hogs.  Her business is really helping her in supporting their needs and she hopes that she can become successful with her endeavors.

is married with two children. She and her family live in Dushanbe, Tajikistan. Alfiya sells nice quality fabrics for national dresses at a large local market. Her family is actively helping her with her business, which she started about 4 years ago. Alfiya would like to ask for a loan of $1200 USD to increase her inventory, which will keep her supplied until the spring season. She believes this timely investment will help generate additional income and increase the family budget. We think Alfiya\u2019s responsibility and strong character will assist her with the current loan repayment.\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Today it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war that ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R. further damaged its already weak economy. 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable--conditions that have resulted in high levels of unemployment and forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

A. is 38 years old.

She decided to learn a trade to earn a living. She now runs a clothing stand and has been selling clothing materials of all kinds over the last 3 years in their busy market center. Through this business she has supported one child to complete junior high school, who is about to enter senior high school. She has insufficient working capital to run the business. With the loan she wants to inject more working capital into the business to scale up business progress. She believes the loan will enable her to purchase good quality and a large quantity of assorted clothing materials to upgrade her inventory. She says she would be grateful for that assistance. Her dream has to do with providing a good quality education for her kids. She belongs to a village bank called Fervent.

His main business and all of the villagers is growing cattle in the winter. He sends his cattle to the pastures with others until winter, During the winter the cattle grazes nearby the house or in the yard because there is green grass and fodder. The family helps him by selling part of the fur and the remaining part sell after three or four month. After six month they trim the goats' fur again and sell on the market. Siloboy chose a smaller cattle because this type of cattle grows faster and he can sell every month two or three heads of cattle and get young ones in return. In the winter the cattle is not fat and cheap. He needs to buy now because grass will grow soon and he can feed the cattle and sell for a higher price. For this Soliboy came to MicroInvest for a loan to buy several heads of cattle.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Elena Fedorchuk, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":274006,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase several heads of cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Utkansoi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":"2009-02-19T08:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Soliboy","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":1600,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":266.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":266.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":266.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":266.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":266.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":266.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":266.67,"processed_date":"2009-03-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:52:58Z","rounded_local_amount":278.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27120726,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":266.67,"processed_date":"2009-04-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T22:05:36Z","rounded_local_amount":278.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36015841,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":266.67,"processed_date":"2009-05-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:13:14Z","rounded_local_amount":278.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44599578,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":266.67,"processed_date":"2009-06-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:57:25Z","rounded_local_amount":278.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52994024,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":266.67,"processed_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-06T10:59:35Z","rounded_local_amount":278.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63215294,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":266.65,"processed_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-10T10:24:19Z","rounded_local_amount":278.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73644796,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-02-19T12:39:01Z","paid_date":"2009-10-10T10:24:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":89793,"name":"Grace","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p>Grace P. is currently in the business of selling Irish potatoes, cassava, and sweet potatoes and is requesting a loan to expand the business.

She is now living with her mom and younger siblings in an old family house in a small town called Simpa, a farming community which is a few kilometers from Tarkwa in the Western Region of Ghana.\r\n<p>\r\nSusana trades in ripped bananas and roasted groundnuts. She buys unripe bananas from wholesalers in the nearby markets, stores them until they're ripe, and then sells them with roasted groundnuts. She sells at a junction in her community. Ripped bananas and roasted groundnuts are a delicacy many people purchase in the afternoons. Susana has been in business for 3 years. It has been her desire to make enough savings to support herself and her son. She wants a loan to procure bananas in bulk so she can maximize her profit margin.

She finished her apprenticeship some years ago and has been running her own business. She makes and sells clothing for school children. She buys fabric from wholesalers in the nearby big towns and offers a variety of designs for children. She also does custom work for clients who come in with their own fabrics and patterns. She owns the shop in which she works. She would use this loan to buy fabric, such as cotton, linen, and polyester, and other sewing accessories, such as linings and pins. Emilia's goal is to work hard and save enough money to acquire a bigger and better workshop.

He is married and supports five people.  Currently he lives in the city of his birth with his family and is a motorbike mechanic.  But with the economic crisis cutting across our country, his business no longer allows him to provide for his family.  He wants to add to his previous business by including commerce in lamp fuel, which he buys at the pump and resells.  This commerce works in the prefecture because of the cuts in electricity from which this particular region of the country suffers.   The income derived from this business will enable him to repay the loan and to cope with the needs of his family. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva

This vibrant group of entrepreneurs is very excited and hopeful about the course their businesses will take with this new capital injection. Neganis A. is one of the group coordinators. She is married and has 6 children. Her business consists of personal sales of beauty products and undergarments. She sells in her home, and to her own neighbors. Some of the other members' businesses include colmados (small convenience stores) and new\/used clothing sales. Since Neganis has to go sell and collect payments from her clients, she dreams of having her own store one day, so she can stay there and customers will come to her instead. She also thinks this will allow her to spend more time with her young children. \r\nOn behalf of Esperanza International, thank you for supporting these entrepreneurs!

After two solidarity loans (group loans), she has gone on to individual loans, where she is on her fourth one.  All the preceding loans have been correctly repaid.

All supplies are gotten at the grand marketplace of Bougouni.

She is 49 years old and married with six children. Currently four of them are in the junior high school. \r\n<p>\r\nGeorgina has been a local manufacturer of palm oil and palm kernel oil for eight years now. Palm oil is produced from palm nuts, while palm kernel oil is produced from palm kernel. The palm kernel is a byproduct of palm oil. The palm kernel is processed through various stages to obtain the palm kernel oil, which is used to prepare many local dishes. \r\n<p>\r\nGeorgina treks to Twifo Praso, a town in the Eastern region of Ghana to purchase palm nut fruits. She supplies the oil she produces to food vendors to prepare their meals. She normally switches her production between the two products. That is, after producing palm oil, she automatically obtains the raw material to produce palm kernel oil. \r\n<p>\r\nShe wants to use this loan to buy more bags of palm nuts and an electric milling machine to increase her efficiency so she can produce oil in larger quantities.

Afterwards, they both return to the farms to continue with their agricultural duties.

From those sales she earns more money and has a higher profit.  Elva is a very active member of her communal bank.  In the season before last she was the secretary and was in charge of drawing up the agreements at each meeting.  This is her 5th loan with MFP, and in all of these loans she has been responsible with her payments.  She is requesting money to expand her candy store according to her wish to have it better stocked to attract more customers.  Elva is very thankful for MFP and all of those who make this loan possible.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kelly Wester, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":274274,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Expand her merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-02-20T20:40:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":925,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":925}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":388.81,"local_amount":1260.99,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:28:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1265.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640500,"comment":null},{"amount":536.19,"local_amount":1739.01,"processed_date":"2009-10-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:05:00Z","rounded_local_amount":1745.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996417,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-02-20T22:14:04Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T03:05:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":89952,"name":"Lauro","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Lauro tiene 38 a\u00f1os de edad, est\u00e1 separado desde hace dos a\u00f1os, vive solo en una casa alquilada, mientras que sus 3 hijos viven con su ex esposa.

Desde muy joven se ha dedicado a las labores agr\u00edcolas, sus chacras est\u00e1n distantes a la ciudad, cerca de 2 horas caminando. Pero Roberto vive cerca a su chacra, y lo que siembra mayormente es achote y caf\u00e9 que seg\u00fan la temporada es rentable, una vez que pasa la cosecha de caf\u00e9 se dedica a sus cultivos de achote y ma\u00edz morocho para alimento de las aves de corral.  En la siembra del achote y ma\u00edz no invierte mucho, y tampoco es mucho esfuerzo, solo la siembra, renovar los cultivos y abonar la tierra. Se cosecha antes de que maduren bien para que no pierda nada, en seguida procede a secar el ma\u00edz y luego a desgranar cada mazorca que vende por kilos. Roberto trata de acumular una cantidad mayor para luego vender por sacos a 45 soles cada uno, lo bueno es que siempre tiene tiempo para cuidar de cada una de sus chacras, y est\u00e1 muy contento con el trabajo que realiza. Roberto es un cliente muy inquieto y bromista con los dem\u00e1s integrantes del banco comunal; este es su 5to pr\u00e9stamo con MFP, y en todo este tiempo ha demostrado ser un cliente muy responsable y asiste puntualmente a todas las reuniones. El dinero que solicita es para la compra de fertilizantes para el abonado correspondiente de sus chacras de c\u00edtricos, caf\u00e9 y ma\u00edz.","en":"Roberto is 41-years-old and has lived in his own house with his mother and two children for nearly 10 years.  Since he was very young he has made his living as a farmer.  His fields are far from the city, close to two hours' walk.  But Roberto lives near his farm, on which he plants primarily achote (annato, a spice) and coffee, which are profitable, depending on the season.  Once the coffee harvest is over, Roberto works on planting his achote, as well as morocho (white) corn to feed his poultry.  Planting achote and corn doesn't require too much effort, and Roberto doesn't invest much in it, except for sowing, replanting, and fertilizing.  He harvests them before they get too ripe so he doesn't lose any.  He dries the corn right away, then threshes each cob, and sells it by the kilo.  Roberto tries to accumulate a large quantity of corn, which he can then sell for 45 soles per sack.  The good thing is that he always has time to tend each one of his fields, and is very happy with his work. \r\n\r\nRoberto is a lively client, and loves to joke around with the other members of the village bank.  This will be his 5th loan with MFP; he has always proven to be a very a responsible client, and he attends every meeting on time.  He intends to use his loan to buy fertilizers for his citrus, coffee and corn fields.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jill Heske, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":274328,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy fertilizers for his crops","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-02-20T14:00:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roberto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":625}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":15.63,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:29:45Z","rounded_local_amount":50.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640503,"comment":null},{"amount":609.37,"local_amount":1950,"processed_date":"2009-10-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:04:58Z","rounded_local_amount":1983.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996421,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-02-20T15:17:43Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T03:04:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":89970,"name":"Aida","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Aida Y. is a young entrepreneur.

Almost always, 99% of UMC Primary pupils pass the examination to enter secondary school. The children also participate in extracurricular activities, such as football (soccer), other athletic games, and  social events organized for all primary schools in Makeni.\r\n\r\nTeaching is a rewarding profession, but it is not well paid. Government salaries for teachers are usually small, so teachers often have to supplement their incomes. But with this loan, they will be able to invest in something meaningful and gradually repay the loan within a ten-month period from their monthly salaries.Some of the teachers will use their portion of the loan to pay school fees for themselves or their children. Other will invest their portion in businesses or farming. And others will use their portion to buy furniture or improve their homes. This is the first loan UMC Primary school is seeking from SMT. They were inspired by UMC Secondary school to apply for a loan from SMT.\r\n\r\nSallamatu B. (3rd from Left) is the head teacher of this school. Sallamatu was born in Yoni Banna, a small town in the Tonkolili district. She is thirty-six years old. She is married to the principal of UMC Secondary School, Makeni, and the couple has two children. She has been teaching for the past fourteen years. She has always found it necessary to take on extra work, such as selling foodstuffs, to supplement her monthly salary. She would use her portion of this loan to buy palm oil (the most popular cooking oil) in bulk for resale. She would use the profits to pay school fees for her eldest son, who is in class four.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4875,"image":{"id":274356,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"Buy palm oil for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Makeni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.883333 -12.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2009-02-18T21:40:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":4875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sallamatu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adama ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ina J.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Osman","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Saidu K.","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bassie ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Mohamed H.","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Franklyn K.","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"John B.","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"David ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"John E.","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosaline M.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francess H.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Florence N.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Peter P.

Mar\u00eda has 4 children.  Her oldest son is 39 years old and works as a biologist.  Her 36-year-old daughter works as a nurse, and her other daughter, who is 33, works as a secretary.  Her youngest son is 25 and is in his 4th year of school.  Her spouse works on a shrimp boat.  Her plan is to maintain her customer base since it is very difficult to keep them these days.  She is organizing things so that her customers can buy her products.  Mar\u00eda hopes to establish her own business selling various products that can be offered from her home.  She thanks God for the work that allowed her children to become professionals and move forward in the careers they studied.  She hopes to improve her home and save money so that when she cannot go to work because of her age or other life circumstances, she can live a peaceful and satisfactory life with her husband.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda sells salsa, annatto, aniline, chamomile, cotton, rosemary, and cloves, among other things.  She has had her business for 20 years.  Mar\u00eda is a street vendor and travels along various streets in the morning.  In the afternoon she sets up in some part of the market.  She started this business with her own funds instead of investing them in her house.  Because of this business, Mar\u00eda was able to pay for her children's education and support them until they were able to do so themselves.  Even though she does not have to support her children, Mar\u00eda keeps working because she has always done so, and she does not like to be idle.  She also needs to take care of her personal needs such as health care, energy, water, and telephone bills, and other expenses that allow her to keep working and face the difficulties and poverty that are sweeping across the country.  She will use the loan as working capital, purchasing more products that allow her to survive and continue her work.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kelly Wester, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":274420,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-02-20T19:30:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Elsa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":8500,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":708.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":708.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":708.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":708.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":708.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":708.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":708.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":708.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":708.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":708.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":708.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":708.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.38}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":35.8,"local_amount":716.07,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:38:03Z","rounded_local_amount":721.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27092097,"comment":null},{"amount":35.02,"local_amount":700.59,"processed_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:36:56Z","rounded_local_amount":705.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35985478,"comment":null},{"amount":35.42,"local_amount":708.33,"processed_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:08:34Z","rounded_local_amount":713.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44446095,"comment":null},{"amount":36.09,"local_amount":721.9,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:42:25Z","rounded_local_amount":727.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52956732,"comment":null},{"amount":282.67,"local_amount":5653.11,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T13:59:39Z","rounded_local_amount":5696.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63174153,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

She has been selling trout in the her country's capital city for two years. She travels there every weekend, and two days before her trip she gathers everything she needs for her business, since it's the only income she has. In the future she would like to be a large distributor of local foods, so she is planning to invest more capital in her business, which is the engine that drives her financial earnings. This is the first time Luisa has gotten a loan from MFP. She is one of the founders of her banco comunal (communal bank) and on her sister's recommendation has had a positive experience working together with the other members. She is requesting a loan in order to buy more fish to sell.

She longs to eventually have a shop, since she can't sell her large quantity of products comfortably because she doesn't have an appropriate place for them.

She and her family have a shoe factory where they make beautiful leather shoes, selling them wholesale to a number of retailers. They manufacture large quantities of shoes, especially during the school year, when they make shoes and send them to other provinces where they sell at higher prices. Within the production process, Gladys is in charge of sales and takes products to the capital to distribute them and, if she has the opportunity, even to sell them to individuals. She enjoys the work and does it every Friday and Saturday, which are very good days for business. The rest of the week, she takes care of running the factory and managing the staff, since her education in administration helps her in that area. She hopes eventually to improve her marketing, and is submitting paperwork to negotiate with governmental bodies that have requested large quantities of merchandise for the poorest schools in the country. She would like to be part of that project. Gladys is one of MFP's oldest clients, and this is her seventh loan. She tells us that her time working with our institution has helped her improve her factory and her interpersonal relations.

The three sons have their own families and therefore do not help their parents.  That is why Abdulakim despite his age is a very energetic and motivated man who understands this business well.  Abdulakim would like to purchase a pair of cows so that his wife can sell milk in the future, thanks to this they will be able to improve their lives.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by
