His father works as an archeologist, which means that he has to travel a lot, so he does not spend much time with his sons. Inti Amaru is a hardworking and talented young man. Despite the fact that his mother passed away 5 years ago and sadness struck the family, he did not leave his studies. Thanks to his father's support, he was able to finish his degree and has been working as an accountant for 2 years, which has given him a chance to start on home improvement. He needs this loan in order to build a protective wall around his yard because he wants to provide safety from the crime that threatens his neighborhood day after day. With this loan, he will purchase construction materials to start building. In the future, he hopes to keep improving whatever is needed in his house, which he has not been able to do so far due to lack of capital. This loan will help him reach his goal of living more comfortably with his brothers so that they can get ahead in life.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Elizabeth Casian, Kiva

The 7 group members live in Pococi, Limon, a rural region located near the Caribbean coast of Costa Rica. The women in this group are involved in various entrepreneurial productive activities including: clothing and jewellery sales as well as sewing and bread-making (and selling). This loan will be used to make general investments conducive to the expansion of business activities by purchasing clothing, jewellery, and materials necessary for bread-making and sewing clothes. The group members engaged in clothing sales contact suppliers, make clothing purchases and sell clothes to members of the Pococi community. The other members produce clothing and bread in their homes to sell at a later date. \r\n\r\nSome of the members engaged in bread-making aspire to one day open their own bakery. In general the group hopes this loan will assist them in improving their standard of living; specifically, the members would like to be able to invest in a higher level of education. A main obstacle for the members of this group has been the lack of available financial services in their community. This loan will extend the reach of business loans to a group of hard-working entrepreneurs living in a poor Costa Rican community. \r\n\r\nThe Women\u00b4s Bank in Search of Success was formed in July of 2009. This loan will be the group's second with Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer. The loan consultant who has been working with the group members over the past 7 months describes these women as hard-working, entrepreneurial-minded individuals who aspire to improve living conditions for themselves and their families. The women work together well and have exhibited responsibility and punctuality with respect to past loans. \r\n\r\nIn general, there is ample demand for the products sold by the women of this group. The members have successfully used their first loan to build their client base. They are happy and excited to now be applying for a larger loan amount than they have in the past. \r\n\r\nFor the members, the name of this group symbolizes the possibility of succeeding in life and the goal of becoming self-sufficient."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2550,"image":{"id":493603,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

Since separating from her partner, she was faced with providing food and education to her 3 children.  Now two of them are older and independent, but she still cares for the younger one.\r\n<p>\r\nShe has worked arduously since she was young, so having to care for her children on her own was not very difficult for her.  She was previously a door-to-door saleswoman and with her earnings, she was able to build her own house where she set up a grocery store.  This is how, for the past 8 years, she has been working in her store where she also sells fruits and vegetables, since she earns more with these than with the groceries.  She wakes up at 3am three times per week to go shopping at the wholesale market and purchase fruits and other products.  Oswalda likes selling because it keeps her entertained and she talks with her customers.

For the past four years, he has operated a general store, which he began with capital from some cows he sold. He invested the money in this little store in order to provide for his family's daily needs. His aim with the current loan is to invest in staple foods and basic items such as rice, beans, sugar, cooking oil, soap, cleaning supplies, cereals, meats and dairy products in order to increase his sales. One of the difficulties he has faced has been the lack of sufficient capital to stock his store with a variety of products, but thanks to the financing, he has been able to increase his investment.

P., 45, is married and has three children, who are an 8-month-old baby and an 11-year-old and 15 years old.  He is a mechanical engineer who worked for a company that declared bankruptcy.  Because of this, he had to resign his position there and he began to work for a company that distributes popular consumer products.  Once there, he came up with the idea to ask this company to give him merchandise on credit so that he could sell them from home to his close friends; these sales would be based on prior orders.  Thus began his business filling orders for snacks, food items and beverages.\r\n\r\nSoon, doing both jobs and with help from his wife and father, he was promoted in his job.  However, this required frequent travel and weekly separations from his family, who increasingly needed the presence of both husband and father and \u201cnot just passing through\u201d as his wife said.  At the same time, his home-based business kept growing and he earned more from it than as a salaried employee. He decided to retire therefore and dedicate himself full-time to his family and his own business.  \r\n\r\nDuban has shelving in his living room that is filled with household items that are ordered from him via telephone and Internet.  This is his work modus operandi; it isn\u2019t a store that is open to the public but, rather, a type of warehouse that is set up to fill orders that are then sent out for home delivery.\r\n\r\nHe is very proud to be able to enjoy the company of his baby, his two children and his wife and to be able to be there for them in their day-to-day lives.  Having his business at home has improved his family structure and he is able to control his income better which is of great benefit for his household.\r\n\r\nHis dream is to set up a self-service store and is looking for an appropriate locale for it.  He has purchased new shelving and is preparing for an influx of customers because he wants to be more competitive, generate higher earnings and employment, especially in his family.\r\n\r\nTo start his journey toward meeting this goal he needs funding from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo to buy merchandise to fill his new shelves.  His aim is to become known commercially there for this is his first loan request from the organization.  His greatest challenges are his growth as a person and as an entrepreneur, to work persistently to educate his children, and to have his own home.\r\n\r\nDuban lives in a neighborhood, Barrio Abajo, which is  rich in Caribbean cultural traditions, near the site of Barranquilla\u2019s Carnival; a neighborhood made up of enthusiastic people with a marked potential for baseball since it has the most well-known stadium from which have risen internationally famous baseball players, like Edgar Rentar\u00eda, who is now part of the US Major Leagues.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":485724,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy stock inventory.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2010-02-23T19:10:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Duban Enrique","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":2300000,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":249615},{"due_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":272385},{"due_date":"2010-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":278059},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":283852},{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":289766},{"due_date":"2010-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":295803},{"due_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":301965},{"due_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":328555}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":130.23},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.12},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.07},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":148.1},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":151.18},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":157.55},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":171.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":130.23,"local_amount":249615,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:01:11Z","rounded_local_amount":251481.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128949060,"comment":null},{"amount":142.12,"local_amount":272385,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:19:08Z","rounded_local_amount":274421.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144712233,"comment":null},{"amount":145.07,"local_amount":278059,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:47:32Z","rounded_local_amount":280138.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151895733,"comment":null},{"amount":148.1,"local_amount":283852,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:11:55Z","rounded_local_amount":285974.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159636060,"comment":null},{"amount":151.18,"local_amount":289766,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:17:08Z","rounded_local_amount":291932.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166850160,"comment":null},{"amount":154.33,"local_amount":295803,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:08:01Z","rounded_local_amount":298015.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172116925,"comment":null},{"amount":157.55,"local_amount":301965,"processed_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:00:46Z","rounded_local_amount":304223.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177410792,"comment":null},{"amount":171.42,"local_amount":328555,"processed_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:08:19Z","rounded_local_amount":331012.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182550449,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-03-02T00:42:51Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T14:08:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":178869,"name":"Las Triunfadoras Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El comit\u00e9 LAS TRINFADORAS, est\u00e1n en el 5\u00b0 ciclo del programa bancomunal la linea de cr\u00e9dito que manejan es de 100.000 Gs.

Bryan is 18, Johan is 12, and Maricielo is 8.  She has a great desire to get ahead in order to give her family the best in spite of the fact that she is separated from her life partner.\r\n\r\nWhen she was very young she learned what hard work is.  It is for that reason that, when confronted with raising her children alone, she had not doubts about undertaking a business that would be profitable and allow her to keep taking care of her children.  That is how she started selling clothes by order and on credit ten years ago.  She noted the good earnings she obtained.  She currently buys merchandise according to the time of year.  For example, it is now the school season, and she is selling school uniforms.\r\n\r\nThis woman puts forth much effort looking to get ahead everyday.  She likes her work because it is peaceful, and she does it from her house.  In the future she plans to set up a clothing store in a commercial center where there are a lot of people. \r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with MFP.  She is very grateful to the people who make it possible for her to access a loan in order to keep working.  Knowing that classes start in March, Carmen plans to use the money she is requesting to buy a bigger quantity of uniforms and school shoes.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":493748,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"Increase merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-02-23T01:20:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":165}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:20Z","rounded_local_amount":168.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128993282,"comment":null},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:38:02Z","rounded_local_amount":168.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136718065,"comment":null},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:53Z","rounded_local_amount":168.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751740,"comment":null},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:03:00Z","rounded_local_amount":168.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151934202,"comment":null},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:37:08Z","rounded_local_amount":168.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159672977,"comment":null},{"amount":57.75,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:40:15Z","rounded_local_amount":166,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166886774,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-02-23T16:04:54Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:40:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":178874,"name":"Guillermo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Guillermo Modelo B. tiene 52 a\u00f1os y vive en el barrio Ciudadela 20 de Julio, en la ciudad de Barranquilla, con su c\u00f3nyuge  y sus cuatro hijos en las edades de 25 y 34 a\u00f1os;  Se dedica a la elaboraci\u00f3n y venta de fritos, bebidas arom\u00e1ticos, caf\u00e9, canela y toronjil entre otras; es muy usual  ver a Guillermo, por la tarde de 2 a 9 p.m., circulando por Metrocentro, un centro comercial muy bien conocido en el sur de Barranquilla; Inici\u00f3 este negocio como vendedor de caf\u00e9 en el a\u00f1o 2003, y gradualmente fue agregando  bebidas arom\u00e1ticas variadas y fritos.

This is his second loan with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, and since receiving credit, he feels that he has made progress in terms of his income, which he has been able to increase. He is currently applying for a loan in the value of 1,300,000 Colombian pesos (COP) to improve the presentation of his business and to help protect the environment. He will invest the funds in purchasing equipment for his business that is currently in poor condition, such as a cooler, some thermos bottles, a blender, an orange juicer and a thermal display case. \r\n\r\nHis greatest challenge is to make progress with his business and help his family get ahead. He dreams of operating his business on a permanent site where he can sell his products, and having a house of his own, which would give him great stability. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

He lives together with his parents in the small village of San Pablo Escurre in the Olmos district which is located two and a half hours from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nFor a living, he runs a delivery service.  Usually he hauls fruit or wool or livestock to the various villages in Olmos.  This business is very useful both for him and for his customers.  The business provides the income needed to pay for his personal expenditures and also helps his neighbors solve their shipping problems as the majority of the villages in the district are located far away from each other and are not connected by regular transportation.\r\n\r\nRegular use on rugged roads has resulted in his only vehicle requiring several urgent repairs.  It is for this reason that he has needed to solicit his first loan from Edpyme Alternative.  He is asking for 1500 Nuevos soles in order to repair and maintain his vehicle.\r\n\r\nTomasito is a hard working, responsible young man.

To her, Santo Tomas is a municipality of people willing to help each other and even outsiders; they like festivals and that is why they have the Carnaval Intermunicipal del Atl\u00e1ntico that integrates the entire Department; but beyond dancing, the \u201cTomasino\u201d (as people from Santo Tomas are called) is a human being who likes to study and has great capacity to improve herself or himself. \r\nMar\u00eda Mercedes has a facility next to her house where she takes care and prepares children to get through pre-kinder, kinder, and transition period; she also conducts activities to reinforce and compliment the work of students brought by their parents; the students are coached to exceed their school achievements through guided work. She had not finished high school when she started this line of work, and she begun by helping the neighbor\u2019s children without charging them, but they brought their own desks to sit on; little by little, with the level of progress achieved by these children, many \u201ctomasina\u201d mothers sought her services; for this reason and with their help, she decided to expand the classrooms and she equipped what are now 3 classrooms, where the children learn in a better space. In the interest of continuing to bring a better learning environment, she is requesting a loan of $2.000.000 that she will invest in improvements of her facilities, such as: plaster walls, change roof cover, accommodate ecological areas and buy inexpensive and healthy snacks for her children.\r\nHer mid-term dream is to expand the coverage and enter the educational system officially, for which she is preparing; even though she has no biological children, her calling as a mother and a teacher is completely dedicated to the children, and the ones in her school project are no exception. She stimulates the completion of the different levels by integrating the children with their parents through small ceremonies for fulfilled achievements, in which all participants feel happy with the progress, especially \u201cLa Se\u00f1o\u201d, as she is known by everybody in Santo Tom\u00e1s.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Carlos Morales, Kiva

They live about 20 kilometers outside the city of Momostenango, Totonicap\u00e1n.  Currently they have a lot of cattle, but they need more capital to buy pasture.  The members have organized themselves as a group because together they can obtain a loan that will allow them to have higher quality livestock that they can sell to locals.  This way they will be able to sell their cattle with greater frequency.  Currently, they have a six months sales rotation with their capital, which is also used for other trades like making clothing.  \r\n\r\nThey will not have problems with the repayment responsibilities.  They have spent about 13 years raising animals.  With the financing they will get through Kiva, they can receive greater revenues, which will allow them to help develop the community where they live.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lydia

This time of the year is a favorable time to purchase animals, because over the winter cattle tend to lose weight and therefore command a lower price.

Sorn, 30, has a business selling brooms at the local market of Takeo province. On average, she makes around US$3 each day. Her husband, pictured here, stays at home helping her making brooms to sell. This couple has been making and selling brooms since 2002. Broom is made from some kinds of long grasses, which grow in the forest. This couple together has three children living at home to support.

With this loan, she expects to earn a monthly profit of 35,000 FCFA which will allow her to grow her business and pay interest on the loan through Soro Yiriwaso.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Shannon Arnold, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":494262,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase a freezer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Bougouni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.416667 -7.483333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-02-25T04:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mafoun\u00e9 ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":200000,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-13T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2010-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2010-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2010-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2010-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2010-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2010-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2010-03-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:59:57Z","rounded_local_amount":20474.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129021678,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:15:08Z","rounded_local_amount":20474.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136746469,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:21Z","rounded_local_amount":20474.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144779007,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:16:51Z","rounded_local_amount":20474.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151961212,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:30Z","rounded_local_amount":20474.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159699370,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:58:12Z","rounded_local_amount":20474.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166913297,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:40:56Z","rounded_local_amount":20474.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172180489,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:14Z","rounded_local_amount":20474.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177476532,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:39:57Z","rounded_local_amount":20474.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182613322,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:42:58Z","rounded_local_amount":20474.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188751809,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-02-25T06:39:30Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T14:42:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":179175,"name":"Dulamjav","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dulamjav is 39 years old and lives with her husband and two children in Tuv province, Mongolia.

Her greatest monthly expenses include paying utility bills, school fees for her children, medication and feeding the family. Margaret owns a stall where she sells charcoal in Makerere Kikoni and she is a policewoman attached to Kawempe police station. She works seven days a week. She receives an average of 20 customers a day. She has done this business for over 12 years. She incurs transport costs to and from buying sacks of charcoal from suppliers in Kawempe. Her main challenges are seasonality and the rainy season because she works from a muddy and open place.  She sells on a retail basis only. She has been with MCDT for over 10 years, taking her 20th loan, working all this time with the same group mates. She wants to use this loan to buy more sacks of charcoal.

She lives with her husband in a nuclear family in the 3rd district of S\u00e9gou (4th administrative region of the Republic of Mali).  She did not attend a modern school due to societal reasons.  She instead attended a Koranic school, but she dropped out after having mastered a few <i>suras<\/i> for praying.  \r\n\r\nWith the aim of participating in the economy, Adam started with several revenue-generating businesses along side her older sister, who used to be a major shopkeeper of S\u00e9gou.  Rich with these years of experience, she eventually advanced on her own, continuing in the same business as her sister for the past twenty years.  She enjoys a large customer base and recognition.  Her sales capacity is due to the quality of her merchandise and her affordable prices.  \r\n\r\nWith plans to increase her business capital, in order to make more profit, she turned toward the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso.  She has had an association with it for 42 months.  After three solidarity loans and two individual loans, all repaid, she is now on her third individual loan.  She intends to use this new loan to buy 20 men's outfits (suits with pants) in Burkina Faso.

She lives as a family with her husband and their six children in Banankoro, a village located 10 kilometers from the city of S\u00e9gou (fourth administrative region of the Republic of Mali).\r\n\r\nNever having been to school, she began money-making activities very young with her mother, who sold condiments. After several years' apprenticeship and having learned much, she chose to make and sell juice and non-alcoholic drinks, and also incense, which she has been doing for eighteen years. She has a large clientele in and around the village.\r\n\r\nIn order to satisfy her customers, she approached Soro Yiriwaso, with whom she has been involved for 42 months. After five group loans and one individual loan, all fully repaid, she is on her second individual loan.\r\n\r\nShe plans to use the loan to buy six bags of gu\u00e9ni (root used for making incense), three kilos of magnonkis\u00e9ni (a plant), two kilos of sarakatan\u00e9 (bark from an Arabian tree) and perfume bottles. She gets her ingredients from the large market in S\u00e9gou and generally sells for cash to her customers, who are chiefly women.\r\n\r\nShe plans to make a profit of 35,000 FCFA, which will be used to pay gas expenses for her children's school, the lyc\u00e9e (high school) in S\u00e9gou.

She lives with her husband in a nuclear family in the Somono district of S\u00e9gou (the fourth administrative region of the Republic of Mali). Mainouna left school in the third grade of elementary school (according to the Mali education system) in order to set up a small business at her mother's to sell sweetmeats. After several years' apprenticeship with her mother in order to master the mechanics of business, she ended up developing her own business selling millet and rice, which she has been carrying out now for seven years. She benefits from a large customer base and carries out her business on the market of Somono in the town of S\u00e9gou.\r\n\r\nWith the aim of increasing her working capital in order to make more profit, she resorted to Soro Yiriwaso. She has been in relations with this company for the past 48 months. After four group loans and two individual loans which have all been paid without incident, she is now on her third individual loan which she plans to use to buy 800kg of rice. She gets her supplies in the Office zone of Nigeria, more precisely in Dougabougou and S\u00e9ribala. \r\n\r\nMrs. Mainouna T. generally sells for cash to a customer base made up of both women and men. With this loan she expects to make a monthly profit of 75,000 FCFA. This profit will allow her to help her husband and to contribute to social events (baptisms, marriages etc.).

He lives in his father's house in a large traditional family with his mother and five brothers. This is in the S\u00e9bougou district of S\u00e9gou (the third administrative region of the Republic of Mali). Ousmane left school in the eighth grade of elementary school (according to the Mali education system) to work with his older brother who had a shop selling various items. Having spent two years there, he had mastered the mechanics of business. For the past three years he has been carrying out his own business purchasing and selling a variety of items in a shop in the Angloul\u00eame neighborhood. His shop lies close to Boulevard CAN 2002, a strategic business area of S\u00e9gou. In order to increase his working capital, he turned to Soro Yiriwaso, and he has had relations with this company for the past 24 months. After two individual loans which were repaid without incident, he is on his third individual loan with which he plans to buy half a ton of sugar and a barrel of (edible) oil.

Married to Jocelyn DJIDO, a driver, Rosine is the mother of five children, all having had schooling. Only three of the children live with her in the Allomey area, and the couple shares the various household expenses.\r\n\r\nTo meet her needs and those of her children, Rosine sells dental care sticks, shoes and jewelry at the Allada market. She gets her supplies from Dantokpa, Benin\u2019s international market, and also from Lom\u00e9 in neighboring Togo.\r\n\r\nRosine has been pursuing this activity for the past four years, and has already been granted two loans from ALID\u00e9, both of which were duly reimbursed. She is now requesting a third loan, to increase her stock of supplies and generate more income.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ren\u00e9 McConnell, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":494309,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Jewelry","sector":"Retail","use":"Buy jewelry and two bags of dental care sticks","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Allada","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"9.5 2.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2010-02-24T21:30:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosine ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":150000,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":16666.64}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.12},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.11}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":36.11,"local_amount":16666.67,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:41:08Z","rounded_local_amount":17396.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136619419,"comment":null},{"amount":36.11,"local_amount":16666.67,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:40:43Z","rounded_local_amount":17396.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144653219,"comment":null},{"amount":50.41,"local_amount":23266.66,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-20T07:28:49Z","rounded_local_amount":24285.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151835422,"comment":null},{"amount":21.81,"local_amount":10066.68,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:10:07Z","rounded_local_amount":10507.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159575819,"comment":null},{"amount":36.12,"local_amount":16666.67,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-30T08:14:40Z","rounded_local_amount":17396.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166954334,"comment":null},{"amount":36.11,"local_amount":16666.67,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-29T09:13:34Z","rounded_local_amount":17396.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172055992,"comment":null},{"amount":58.93,"local_amount":27199.98,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-03T10:26:13Z","rounded_local_amount":28391.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177347526,"comment":null},{"amount":37.44,"local_amount":17279,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-19T09:35:36Z","rounded_local_amount":18035.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182482612,"comment":null},{"amount":11.96,"local_amount":5521,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-05T09:07:27Z","rounded_local_amount":5762.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188617459,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-02-26T01:37:59Z","paid_date":"2011-02-05T09:07:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":179218,"name":"Hiram","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hiram is a 29-year-old man who runs a studio and employs one person.

Zulaikho is 43 years old. She is married with four children. About 14 years ago, the economic situation of the family forced Zulaikho to start her own business. She decided to sell fabric for national dresses in the market. Zulaikho tries to diversify her range of goods to meet the demands of the clients with various tastes and levels of income.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Nazar is 50 years old. He was born in Dushanbe, Tajikistan. He is the father of six children and his main work consists of breeding cattle. This very remunerative activity enables him to provide for the needs of his family. A very ambitious man, Nazar would like to buy a greater number of cattle and to build a farmhouse to house them in order to ensure their safety. Due to a lack of finances, he is asking for a loan of 4,500 Somoni for the realization of this project. When his dream is carried out, Nazar will be able to have a greater source of revenue for his growing family.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She operates a mixed farm in western Kenya, near the town of Kitale, and has been farming for over twenty years. While she used to focus more on fruit and vegetable production, her primary income now comes from the sale of milk, which she does personally at the local markets. She says that the main challenge currently is finding a good, reliable market for her product where she can maintain profitability.\r\n<p>\r\nJenifer requested this loan through Juhudi Kilimo for Kes. 71,400 to purchase and insure a dairy cow. She will also use a portion of the money to improve the sleeping shed she built for her current livestock. \r\n<p>\r\nJenifer says that with this loan she will have sufficient milk to become a supplier to the KCC - the Kenya Cooperative of Creameries. This will result in a more stable income which she will use to pay for her children's college fees and their basic needs. \r\n<p>\r\nLooking to the future, Jenifer hopes to build a modern grazing unit to ensure her animals are well taken care of.
