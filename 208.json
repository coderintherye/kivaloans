It is a very joyful group, that, with the assistance of loans, is able to work with much responsibility. <p>\r\n\r\n<p>The majority of group members are married with large families. Currently, they live in rented rooms, that with the passage of time have become crowded due to the growth of their families. They have the dream of being able to buy  homes of their own to offer greater comfort to their children, and for this they work from very early in the morning in their different businesses.  <p>\r\n\r\n<p> The activities of the Pacajes group are diverse: some of the members sew, others create handmade sweaters and blankets, and some also make artistic tapestries and tinplate artwork. <p>\r\n\r\n<p> The group members seek this loan with the goal of increasing their sales. For this, they will need to buy raw materials and complete high quality projects with which they will increase their income - the main objective of which is to improve the quality of life for their families. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michelle Harrison, Kiva

Her goal is to make improvements to her home and to have it just the way she likes it so that when she is older she can be comfortable. She would like to invest this loan in order to get more clients and more sales. \r\n\r\nThe group members state that they have seen good earnings from the loans they've obtained, which they have invested in seasons during which there is good demand and a good price. \r\n\r\nIvonne P. makes clothes like aprons, \"gabachas\" (traditional aprons), and clothes ordered by people in her community and delivers to some people who sell door-to-door.

Vasquez and Mercedes del Carmen Hernandez Orozco. The solidarity group Karla is from the locality of Las Flores, city of Masaya. Their businesses are the making of clothing, shoes and a beauty salon. They are well known and trusted in the community, they are young women with a lot of drive and the desire to work and improve themselves. They like to work with Adim because they receive training in how to improve their businesses. Mrs. Nancy makes clothes; she has a small workshop in her home where she makes aprons, school shirts and tablecloths. She has a small child, and started her business to generate more income and help with expenses. Her husband works in a textile company, which is what gave her the idea for the business. Mrs. Mercedes del Carmen makes woman's shoes, she has two workers, her workshop is in her home. With credit she purchased glue, leather, and plastic to design her sandals. She hopes to improve her workshop and make it weather-proof, since presently she cannot work when it rains, as it is out in the open. Ms. Karla de los Angeles has a small beauty salon in her home, very good clients, and needs the loan to buy cosmetics for use in her shop. She was selected the group's coordinator, responsible for collecting the payments and dropping them off at the Adim office. She dreams to improve her beauty salon, purchase more mirrors and provide a better atmosphere to the place. Her husband works at a chicken processing factory and helps with the household expenses; she has three school-age children, and this business has helped her provide for her children immensely.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Monica Hayden, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":307952,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","use":"comprar cosm\u00e9ticos como tintes, cremas para peinar, geltinas para el pelo, colores para peinar, etc. Tambien compra pinturas como : maquillajes, cremas limpiadoras, sombras y lapices labiales, pinturas de u\u00f1as, etc., estos tambien se los ofrece a los clientes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Masaya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.966667 -86.1","type":"point"}},"partner_id":120,"posted_date":"2009-04-23T20:30:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Karla De Los Angeles","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nancy Mercedes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mercedes Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":9500,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1187.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1187.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1187.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1187.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1187.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1187.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1187.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1187.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.38},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.37},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.38},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.37},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.38},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.37},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.38},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":59.37,"local_amount":1187.5,"processed_date":"2009-04-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T09:35:01Z","rounded_local_amount":1195.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35927275,"comment":null},{"amount":59.38,"local_amount":1187.5,"processed_date":"2009-05-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:17:45Z","rounded_local_amount":1195.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44382449,"comment":null},{"amount":59.38,"local_amount":1187.5,"processed_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:18:07Z","rounded_local_amount":1195.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44382450,"comment":null},{"amount":175.93,"local_amount":3518.6,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T16:20:14Z","rounded_local_amount":3543.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52889204,"comment":null},{"amount":2.2,"local_amount":43.9,"processed_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T09:26:15Z","rounded_local_amount":44.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63110532,"comment":null},{"amount":59.4,"local_amount":1187.5,"processed_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T09:27:01Z","rounded_local_amount":1195.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63110533,"comment":null},{"amount":59.34,"local_amount":1187.5,"processed_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T09:31:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1195.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73531968,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-04-23T23:21:15Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T09:31:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":103662,"name":"Faavae","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Faavae C.

Mayo Zone; the neighborhood is maD. up by people from the middle class; the majority of the homes are brick and some are adobe. A large portion of the members own their own home or apartment, and they all have the main basic services.

Shoira devotes herself to the production of wheat, corn and vegetables on her land. For this reason, she remains as long as possible on her land, dedicating herself to the care and fertilization of her fields. With all this effort, it is possible to obtain a good harvest and sell the products, with the aim of offering her three children an education and personal development appropriate to their age. This hard work also prompts her to think of opening a grocery store in her house, thus providing a larger share of income for the family\u2019s kitty. However, this will require a larger investment, and so with this object in mind Shoira is asking for your help in order to obtain the amount asked for to invest in the purchase of a larger quantity of seeds and fertilizer. We hope to count on you, and appeal to your collaborative spirit.  \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

B. is a gentleman who dedicates himself to the business of farming and livestock. Yuldoshboy is a hard-working man who has fought to provide for his family and educate his children, who today are working adults thanks to his example. Currently his children are grown up and they always support and help their father with the business. The challenge that he is currently faced with is the need to invest in the purchase of cattle. For this simple reason he is seeking the support of IMON International to obtain a loan to purchase cattle to sell. Yuldoshboy is grateful to everyone supporting him.\r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

B. is a 29-year-old businessman.

In the beginning it was very difficult, because they needed to invest a lot of working capital. With much effort and the help of his wife he was able to move forward and today has a large plot of land. His vegetables are very good quality, which he says is due to the constant irrigation they receive, since the business has a complete underground irrigation system. They sell their products in the fruit and vegetable market of the city. Jasurbek requests a loan for the purchase of fertilizer and seeds. This will allow him to better provide for his family. \r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Khursanoy is a devoted mother who struggles day after day to provide the best for her family. Seven years ago she got the idea to start raising cattle to contribute to the family finances, taking advantage of the space she had available on their land for this business. \r\n<p>\r\nKhursanoy is engaged in this business together with her adult children. Slowly the number of cows increased and at the same time, her clients started asking for more and more. With an endless list of requests she has finally decided to increase the number of livestock she keeps and for this reason she is requesting a loan. Be an important part of the growth of Khursanoy\u2019s business.    \r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes being a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Rahim is a hard-working man who has fought to provide for his family and educate his children, who today are working adults thanks to his example. Rahim has dedicated himself to the cattle-breeding business for the past 20 years. He purchases calves to raise and fatten them, and then sells them or butchers them to sell the meat. His younger son who lives with him helps Rahim with his business. Today, his major need is acquiring a calf for his business. For this reason Rahim looks for support with IMON International, to buy more of the cattle that make his family\u2019s sustenance possible.   \r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes being a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Abdurahmon is very happy to work with us, because the credit helps him a lot. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Anna Startseva, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":308111,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Rearing and Sale of Cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Khujand","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.28 69.631667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":"2009-04-25T01:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abdurahmon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":500,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-09-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-14T09:17:51Z","rounded_local_amount":290.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87084729,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-10-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-04T09:32:10Z","rounded_local_amount":290.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97000930,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-04-25T02:06:17Z","paid_date":"2009-12-04T09:32:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":103729,"name":"Abdurashid","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"I.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Marhabo is 40 years old. She is divorced and the mother of two children. After the divorce from her husband, Marhabo had to find ways to provide for herself and her children. For 7 years she has had a business baking and selling the national bread \u201clepeshka\u201d. It has now become the family business as the children of Marhabo are grown-up and they are helping their mother (pictured). Marhabo is a cheerful, hard-worker despite the difficulties she faces. She has received and repaid four loans from IMON which have helped create stability for her business. Today Marhabo is requesting for a loan of $1200 USD with the term of 12 months. She is planning to purchase flour and coal required for baking the national bread \u201clepeshka\u201d. This purchase will enable her to increase her sales, to earn more so she can provide her children with good education. \n\n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

Because he buys the flour wholesale, his prices are cheaper than his competitors. Thus he has many customers who will even make a purchase of his flour straight from his house.\r\n<p>\r\nHis mother (pictured) helps him with the business. Today he has a great demand for his goods and that is why he wants to take out an individual loan. Suhrob has requested a loan of $1,200 to add to his working capital and allow him to purchase more inventory. He promises to repay the loan within  nine months. \r\n<p>\r\nSuhrob is ready to work even harder, make sacrifices and push every once and awhile to achieve his goal and, in the near future, to make his own family.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Ulugoy is 40 years old and comes from a large and humble family. She is married and the loving mother of four children.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

","en":"Rafoatniso is 37 years old.  She is married and has three children.  Her husband has his own business, and the children are in school.  Rafoatniso sells candy at the Panchshanbe market in the city of Khujand.  The candy is all imported, and includes brand names such as Nestl\u00e9, SladKo (a Russian brand), and Mars, et cetera. Rafoatniso has been a client of MicroInvest for two years.  At present she carries a wide selection of items.  She sells various imported candies, cookies, wafers and pastries. Her suppliers are now offering her a good deal.  If she places a large order and pays cash, the suppliers will give her a very advantageous, low price.

Reygie A. is 30 years old. She is married and the happy mother of three children. Her husband is a hardworking farmer. They both work hard for the future of their children. Reygie lives with her family in Tagpangi, Cagayan de Oro, Misamis Oriental, Philippines. \r\n<p>\r\nReygie buys and sells fruits and vegetables in their village. She peddles her products every day. Sometimes, she just has her stall standing by their residence and entertains walk-in customers. Reygie works with determination on her business because she considers herself the breadwinner of the family. All of her children go to school and all are still dependents of Reygie.\r\n<p>\r\nFor now, Reygie is planning to rent a  stall in the market. According to her, this is much better than peddling. In order for Reygie to reach her plans, she wants to take advantage of the loan opportunity given by HSPFI (a Kiva partner). She is now applying for loan amounting to PHP 11,000.00. This amount would cover her rent expenses and additional stocks of fruits and vegetables. She is aiming for a higher income, and she plans to have savings for future use.

S. works as a dessert seller at home. She has a daily income of $3.30 and lives in Kompong Chnang province. She is 29 years old and married. Her husband, Nhhel Chan Thol, pictured here, is a fisherman who tries to work hard at fishing the nearby lakes and ponds by using fishing nets and fish traps, then he sells the fish he catches at the local market. Nowadays, both of them live with their sister, a garment worker who gives them $70 a month for household expenses. They have a young child who is a student and an old mother in the family as an extra burden.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Little by little she made her business grow and by offering her clients a way to pay in installments greatly increased her revenue. Now her business is running smoothly.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

That\u2019s where she does business, which she started in 1983 when she was still a student.  She used to sell during all the main vacation periods in July and August.  Her $60 in initial capital had enabled her to buy a sack of cassava flour.  \r\n<p>\r\nOver the years, she acquired solid experience in selling cassava flour until she was married in1989.  She continued her commerce in her home, bringing $240 in capital in 1993.  Her business was destroyed by pillaging that took place the same year.  After a period of inactivity, she started up her business again from 2002 through the present with $60 in capital and in the food sector, still.  \r\n<p>\r\nIn August 2008, Liliane decided to join one of the groups of the micro-finance institution HOPE with the goal of diversifying her business and growing her revenues.  She is a loyal customer of HOPE who has already had two loans that she repaid regularly and completely.  The loan she obtained this April was used to buy two sacks of cassava flour.  She also diversified her business by including smoked and salted fish for resale, so as to augment her profits.  \r\n<p>\r\nLiliane is 41 years old, married, and the mother of five children, ages 5 to 19; the eldest is on his own, and four go to school.  Her business generates for her a profit of $15 a week.  Her ambition is to open an outlet one day for cassava flour and for corn.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva

M. is thirty-nine years old, but his face looks younger. He is married and a father with four children. He lives at Takroase, a mining community at Akim Oda, in the eastern region of Ghana. Sulemana is very resourceful and committed to his family, especially in the area of their education. He is a buyer and seller of gold and diamonds. He makes a living with this business and has worked in the field of mining for fifteen years. He has many suppliers in the village from whom he purchases the gold and the diamonds. Through the relationship he has with the suppliers, he always has stock to sell. He mostly deals with foreigners who come from abroad to buy his gold and diamonds. \r\n<p>\r\nGhana is rich in natural resources. It is a fact that the quality of diamonds and gold from Ghana is rated as one of the best as compared to other countries. This has created increased demand from his buyers, but he is not able to meet those demands. He buys the gold and diamonds at high prices from the suppliers, but, because of the economic situation he now finds himself in, he is not able to buy more.

She is widowed with six children who are currently in school. Her husband died after a prolonged sickness; she spent all her resourced trying save her husband. There is this adage in our Ghanaian language which says \u2018Se owuo kuta adeia nkwa ntumi ngye\u2019 which literally means \u2018When death is holding something life cannot take it from it\u2019. That is what Regina was trying to do to save her husband but could not. \r\n<P>\r\nShe has been a local manufacturer of palm oil (produced from palm nuts) for ten years now. In addition to that she is a food vendor and serves food like rice and stew. She produces the palm oil and supplies it to food vendors to prepare their meals.

He has been driving a taxi for 6 years, operating out of Stop # 32 in Asuncion city, right on the corner near the governmental Department of Records.\r\n\r\nBoth Anibal and Catalina are working hard and supporting each other so that they can offer the children a better quality of life. They also dream of finishing construction on their home. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Sara Sultan, Kiva

Her business is selling cancamos (very large steel staples) and barretas (steel bars and rods) which are use in construction.

lives in the rural area of San Isidro, Ilagan, Isabela.

They have five children and all of them did not have the chance to continue their studies in high school because of their poor living conditions. Their children are: Randy, a 26-year-old driver; Ricky, 24; Gabriel, 22; Marvel, 20; and Marvelito, 17. Their family works together in order to surpass the hardships of life. \r\n<p>\r\nLolita raises native chickens and ducks in their backyard. She gives them rice grain as their food since she does not have enough capital to provide them with feed for their fast growth. Aside from her business and the work of her husband, the family has no other source of income. Then Lolita learned about the Kiva lenders. She wants to borrow at least PHP 3,000.00 in order to buy feed supply for her chicken and ducks.  If she can have excess capital, she is planning to engage in the vending business.  \r\n<p>\r\nLiving away from her children is difficult but she was thankful that they were able to have a job in a textile industry in Mountain Province. She hopes that someday they could also find ways for them to become successful. Lolita believes that \u201cin every hard work you give, there is a reward that

She wants to make her business grow and because of this, she would like to borrow PHP 5,000.00 so that she can buy more stocks of groceries for her store and hopefully be able to sell meat and fish. She is also engaged in selling eggs and ducks in their public market for additional income. She hopes that her business will continue to grow so that her two children will finish their studies.\r\n <p>\r\nAccording to Marivic, she is now content with her life.

and her husband have been ice-cream vendors in their village for four years. They live in Cabisera 5, Centro, San Antonio Ilagan, Isabela. They were blessed with three children: Rochelle, a 19-year-old high school undergraduate due to financial difficulties; Rose-Anne, a 17-year-old high school graduate; and Rhea, who is 10 and in grade school.  Consolacion and her children have a good relationship and she is thankful for God for having them.  \r\n<p>\r\nWith the business they have, they were able to generate income that supported the basic needs of their family.  However, it was not enough to support the education of their children for she still wishes to send her two eldest children to school to pursue their studies.  For them to do that, she and her husband must really work hard and look for opportunities to improve their business.  Because of this, she is requesting a loan of PHP 10,000.00 that will serve as additional business capital for making ice cream and hopefully, increase their income.  Consolacion also shares that success does not only require capital but also requires hard work, diligence and persevering to the best of our ability in our day-to-day work.

is a resident of San Vicente, Quirino, Isabela.

Lilia was glad and proud of her children because they learned to combat poverty by looking for a job. She just hopes that they will someday become successful with their chosen careers.  \r\n<p>\r\nLilia used to manage a sari-sari store (community-based store) in their village.  But for some reason it went bankrupt and closed for a time.  She is now asking for financial assistance from the lenders so she can be able to reopen her store. Her request of PHP 10,000.00 will be used to buy different groceries that she can display and offer to her customers. She is working hard to uplift their living conditions. According to her, she must be very patient in order to achieve her goals in life. \r\n<p>\r\nShe is thankful that her children also help them with their needs. Despite this, she still wants to have her own business and not depend too much on her children since they also have their own families.  She was very excited to have her store back that used to be her partner in sending her children to school.

They are all high-school graduates; however, due to lack of financial resources, they were not able to pursue their college education.  \r\n<p>\r\nEdna wants to help her husband earn an income for their daily needs. She is now asking for a loan of PHP 9,000.00 for the maintenance of their passenger tricycle.

Her goal is to have a progressive business through the financial assistance that she would like to have.  \r\n<p>\r\nShe is wishing to have a better way of life by working hard.

C. is 40 years old. Her husband, Catalino, is working as a driver and they are living a peaceful life in San Isidro, Ilagan, Isabela. They were blessed with four children: Crisanto, a 15-year-old high-school student; Christian, a 12-year-old also in high school; and Chrisilyn, 10, and Christine, 8, who are both in the elementary level of school. The family has a good family relationship and she prays that they can sustain their bonding no matter how many difficulties life may bring.\r\n<p>\r\nMarissa is a vendor of native snacks like \u201ckakanin\u201d (rice cake) in their village. She sells different snacks and with her diligence, she was able to earn a weekly income of PHP 1,000.00.  Her income is being used as rolling capital and buys the necessary ingredients like glutinous rice, coconut and sugar. Her request of PHP 4,000.00 will serve as additional capital for the improvement of her business.  She hopes that her request will be granted for it will really help her not only to support her business but also in sending her children to school and to provide the needs of their family.

She harvests her rice and vegetable products twice a year. She used to borrow financial capital from traders to finance her farming needs, however, the interest is too big and most of her income is being used to pay her credit. Learning about Kiva lenders, Rosemarie requested to borrow PHP 12,000.00 that she will use to maintain her farming needs. She is also planning to put up a village store to further generate additional income if she has extra capital. Being a mother and father to her two children is quite hard but she believes that she can do everything with the guidance of the Lord. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":308207,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Farming needs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Solano, Nueva Vizcaya","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":123,"posted_date":"2009-04-23T06:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosemarie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":12000,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":12000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":250,"local_amount":12000,"processed_date":"2009-10-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T11:53:35Z","rounded_local_amount":12133,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96883320,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-04-23T09:41:04Z","paid_date":"2009-11-15T11:53:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":104086,"name":"Juanita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"She manages a sari-sari store business (community based store) in their village.

Lan has already repaid a previous loan of 2,442,600 VND from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women used to invest in expanding the business.  She is now requesting a new loan of 6,000,000 VND for additional expansion.
