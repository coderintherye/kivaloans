S. is 35 years old and works raising pigs that she then sells, while her husband makes alcohol to sell. She has been raising pigs since 2002, and normally she can sell them for slaughter in about three or four months.

They now have a store where they offer a varitey of products as well as having 2 employees who go out to make sales in the countryside, as they used to when they started their business.\r\n\r\nThe client is requesting the loan to bolster her working capital in order to buy merchandise which they do not have in stock, specifically footwear for men, for which there is a high demand.  She also told us that she will make some improvements to the store, particularly to modernize it with a glass door, as the merchandise needs protection from the dust and the sun.<br

This is 43 year old Matilda A. N.. She is a married mother of three children who are between the ages of 6 and 18. She also supports two dependents who attend school near her house. Matilda is a Tanzanian entrepreneur who has been running a poultry business since 2007. In Tanzania it is called a \u201cKuku\u201d business, as kuku means chicken in Swahili. Kuku is a favorite among Tanzanians and they make finger-licking good fried chicken here!\r\n\r\nHer business is simple, however tedious. She buys chicks, tends to them for five weeks, and then sells them in the market. But as you can see from her photo, tending to chickens is back breaking work!\r\n\r\nHer business is doing well and she is able to make an average monthly profit of about US$100. Matilda is requesting a loan in order to buy additional chicks and feed. She thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

This is 47 year old Hasadia J S.. She is married woman with five children between the ages of 14 and 26. She has owned a vitenge and tailoring business since 2007.\r\n\r\nKitenge (the Swahili plural is vitenge) is a cotton fabric with wax print, printed by using rotary printing machines. Kitenge is a communicating textile - the various colors, patterns, writings and symbols represent moods, feelings, cultures, and traditions of native African people. Women use these colorful and boldly printed fabrics to make traditional Tanzania outfits which usually consist of long fitted skirts and conservative boat necked tops.  As such, Hasadia is a smart entrepreneur and does not simply sell vitenge, but also offers her services as a seamstress.  Thus, customers can select the cloth and the style of outfit they would like as well as have their measurements taken. It\u2019s really a one stop shop for women!\r\n\r\nCurrently her business is able to generate a monthly profit of about USD200 and she is requestring a loan in order to  purchase additional vitenge. In future she hopes to further increase the quantity and range of the stock. She thanks you for your support in advance!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":248284,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":248292,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase additional shoes, sandals and slippers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-12-29T21:40:20Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Navoneiwa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":700000,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":116666.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":116666.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":116666.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":116666.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":116666.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":116666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":116666.67,"processed_date":"2009-01-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:14:54Z","rounded_local_amount":119991.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14887066,"comment":null},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":116666.67,"processed_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:03:46Z","rounded_local_amount":119991.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436349,"comment":null},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":116666.67,"processed_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:55:55Z","rounded_local_amount":119991.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130621,"comment":null},{"amount":91.66,"local_amount":116666.67,"processed_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:24:03Z","rounded_local_amount":119991.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027418,"comment":null},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":116666.67,"processed_date":"2009-05-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:44Z","rounded_local_amount":119991.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613419,"comment":null},{"amount":91.66,"local_amount":116666.65,"processed_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:48Z","rounded_local_amount":119991.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010499,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-12-30T00:44:08Z","paid_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":81718,"name":"Dora","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Dora es socia del Banco Comunal \u201cWi\u00f1ay\u201d del distrito, provincia y departamento de Puno.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":248300,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"To

This is 33 year old Nsia I. M.. She is married with three children between the ages of 2 and 8. \r\n\r\nNsia is quite the entrepreneur as she runs two businesses: a kuku (poultry) business and a tailoring business.  Seems a bit unrelated to the average person, but it makes sense here in Tanzania. A kuku business is a simple, profitable, and popular business here in Tanzania. You simply buy chicks, tend to them for 5 weeks, and then sell them in the market. It does not take all day to tend to the chickens, once in the morning and once in the afternoon, so a go-getter like Nsia also has time to run another business. Her tailoring business is a bit more complicated as she needs to properly measure and sew outfits to her customers' specifications, and customers can be quite demanding!\r\n\r\nHer businesses are doing well and her monthly profits are approximately US$600. She is requesting a loan in order to purchase additional chicks and feed for her kuku business, as well as materials for making clothes for her tailoring business. She thanks you in advance for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":248313,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","use":"To

L\u00f3pez.  She is 55 years old and married.  Mercedes has 2 children:  the elder is 30 years old and is self-employed and the younger is 13 years old and in grade 5.  Her husband is recently unemployed.  Her greatest wish is to make improvements to her home so that her children can live more comfortably.  She plans to build a future for her family by increasing her business and continue working so that the business can continue to generate income which will allow her to provide her children with stability for their studies, that they may have a bright future.\r\n\r\nShe buys and sells pigs.  Her business is home-based in Chichigalpa.  She started her business on her own as she had to make a better life for her family.  Initially, she sold nacatamales (typical food) and did not have many clients and due to high costs the business did not generate enough income.

At the age of 42, Clemencia S. admits that there is no room for her to rest comfortably and wait for unknown blessings. She and her husband Ernesto did not finish any college degree.  Given that fact, the couple tried the fishing business.  The first few months went by with unpredictable returns. But the couple did not give up.  They continued and learned the business. At present, they own 2 units of pumpboats that give a weekly net income of PHP 800 to PHP 1,000.  Not bad when they were just starting out. <P>\r\n\r\n To yield more income, they want to purchase additional fish nets which they can have for rent.  They applied for a loan in the amount of PHP 10,000 from Paglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative.  Clemencia has safeguarded her credit records with the cooperative.  Being a member for almost 4 years, she shared that though the loan windows are readily available, the savings products of Paglaum are what she likes most.  <P>\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. S. have saved for the education of their children.

Mrs. Samnang C. is 44 years old and the mother of five children one of whom is working in a garment factory while the others are attending the local school. \r\n<p>\r\nAll the members in this village bank loan have end-of-term loans so they are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term.

This is 35-year-old Selina A D., who is divorced with two children aged 8 and 14. Selina has been running  a beauty salon business since 2003, a place where her friends and fellow women can gather and literally let their hair down.  Most beauty salons in Tanzania are places where you can buy long hair, short hair, curly hair, straight hair, red hair, blue hair, and then have it attached to your head, woven, cut, or braided, and made to look like your own.  It is quite a thing to be seen!\r\n\r\nSelina works at her business ten hours a day, seven days a week, earning a monthly profit of approximately $200.  She is now requesting a loan of $775 in order to purchase an additional hair dryer, chairs, hair products such as wigs, and other cosmetics.  Due to the success of this business, she hopes to open another in the future, and she thanks you in advance for your support.\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":248902,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","use":"To

This is 43-year-old Mariam A. M., married with four children between the ages of 20 and 26. Mariam has been running a bar since 2004. \r\n\r\nHer bar is a good place to relax and catch up with friends.  Many cannot think of a better way to end a hard day\u2019s work than with an ice cold local beer, under the shade from the blaring Tanzanian sun, with one\u2019s friends. \r\n\r\nWorking at the business 16 hours per day, 7 days per week, and assisted by three employees, Mariam currently earns about $250 each month. She is now requesting a loan of $1000 in order to purchase additional stocks of beer, soda and drinking water, and in the future plans to increase her variety of stocks. Mariam thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":248907,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pub","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase

This is 35-year-old Johari J. M. from Dar es Salaam, the married mother of a nine-year-old child. Johari has been running a tailoring business since 2003. \r\n\r\nAt her tailoring business she purchases vitambaa (material), vitenge (a traditional Tanzanian cloth with wax print), and kanga (printed cotton fabric often with a border along all four sides) and makes them into clothing mainly for women.  She confided in us that what sets her tailoring business apart is that she is more skilled than others and is able to create different kinds of designs for her customers so they can stand out in a crowd. \r\n\r\nWorking at the business 11 hours per day, 6 days per week, and assisted by her husband, Johari currently earns about $240 per month. She is now requesting a loan of $550 to purchase additional materials required for making clothes. In the future, she plans to carry a greater variety of materials in order to differentiate her products even further.  Johari thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":248916,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","use":"To

(Greetings!) from Dar es Salaam, Tanzania and SELFINA! This is 48-year-old Tatu O M., a widowed mother of six children who is also responsible for supporting two dependents because they are orphans. Tatu has been running a mama lishe since 2005. \r\n\r\nA mama lishe is a local restaurant or caf\u00e9 in Tanzania that usually consists of a rough wooden table and some long wooden benches. The food is all-local:  rice, ugali (a hot sticky dough, made from maize flour), plantain (a cooked savoury banana), all served with beans, vegetables, meat, and a variety of sauces.\r\n\r\nWorking at the business eight hours per day, five days per week, Tatu currently earns about $200 each month.  She is now requesting a loan of $400 in order to purchase rice, beans, wheat flower, maize flower, soda and drinking water, and in the future plans to expand her business.  She thanks you in advance for your support!\r\n\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":248923,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase rice,

Both say that their incomes are totally independent of one another.  The members operate various business such as cleaning services; messaging services; ceramic works; public transportation services; and milk, food and cosmetics sales.  All of their businesses face stiff competition but the members are experienced and know how to manage their businesses and work with equanimity.  Generally, the loan will be used to buy basic supplies, make the businesses more productive and allow the members to spend the time they save with their families.  The members have experience with cooperatives so they know how to responsibly manage the funds allocated to them.

","en":"The Kantutus group is represented by Bernardino and is maD. up of 16 members who operate various businesses including: clothing sales; fabric sales; footwear sales; cosmetics sales, sales of baked goods; taxi services; and construction services.  As in all commercial endeavors, there's competition and offers to sell similar products at lower costs, so the members have to have products for which there's a lot of demand and sell them for less.  One advantage for the group is that their businesses are located outsiD. of the city which gives them greater opportunities to sell.  The disadvantage of that for them is that their children can only get a rural education.  They hope to send their children to the city where they would receive a better education.  The loan will be used to buy merchandise and supplies to meet the demands of the market.

Her husband, Mr. Brok P., helps her on the plantation. She is 45 years old, and she is the mother of five children; three of her children are employed in a garment factory, while the other two children are currently attending the local school. <p>\r\n\r\nMrs. Chamroeurn Y. is a pig breeder who is currently raising one pig. Because her business has been doing rather well, she wants to expand and improve the business. Accordingly, she decided to ask for a loan in order to buy two more piglets for her breeding business. <p>\r\n\r\nThis group loan primarily consists of what are referred to as \"end-of-term\" (\"EoT\") loans. Indeed, three members are seeking such EoT loans, while the other group members are seeking monthly payment loans. More specifically, with the EoT loans, the borrowers are not required to repay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan's term (i.e., the maturity date), whereas the monthly payment loans require the borrowers to make regular monthly payments. EoT loans are AMK\u2019s main product because they are the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor people; in particular, such loans allow the borrowers to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to do so. Interestingly, most clients start to make principal payments on EoT loans many months before the end of the loan's term. Further, almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time: AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09%, and AMK has a default rate of 0% on Kiva loans. <p>\r\n\r\nOne group member, Mrs. Sovann Y., is not seeking a loan, but her husband is applying for a loan; as a result, he is captured in the picture rather than her.

K. is a 52 year old man.  He is married and the father of four children.  The household has lived in Ningarhar province for a long time.  Nander has worked as a farmer for the last several years in his village. His children go to school and he is the sole breadwinner for his family.\r\n\r\nNader grows different kinds of vegetables on his land and sells them in the central market of the city.  However, his current $8 a day income is not sufficient to support the family; he needs at least $20.  Besides their schooling, his sons help him on the farm  but Nader doesn\u2019t allow them spend to much time working the farm, as he wants them to do well in school and pursue a bright future.\r\n \r\nNader K. has been thinking about how to solve his problems for a while now. He finally decided to purchase a water pump and increase his livestock.  He knows that this business is quite profitable in his area. There are a lot of grasslands in his village and he would be able to provide sufficient food for the stock. He believes that with the purchase of a water pump he could sell water to other farmers in his village.  With this plan in mind, he has applied for 50,000 Afghanis loan to be repaid over 27 months.\r\n \r\nNader K. wants to expand his business, buying more livestock and start a livestock selling business in future. He thanks the lenders for their assistance.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":249188,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Pruchase

She is 51 years old, the mother of 5 children only one of which goes to school.  The others are already adults and have formed their own families.  She has been separated for 13 years.\r\n\r\nRosa studied until the 2nd grade and says that at the time it was difficult to go to school in her area because a girl would go to school as a 10 year old and at 17 she would be obligated to be at home.  In this way she was not able to study.\r\n\r\nRosa, after her separation, had to begin a business to sustain her children.  The business consists of purchasing and selling staple products, an activity she continues today.  She has one employee, a monthly income of 9,800MT, and is able to save some money periodically.\r\n\r\nThis is her third loan through Hluvuku and her first with Kiva.  The others also were applied to the purchase of merchandise, and she intends to pay this loan off before the maturity so she can solicit another loan to make arrangements in her home.<br

It is now harvest season, and Mrs. Boeurn K. does not have enough money to hire laborers to harvest the rice.Thus, she decided to ask for a loan for this purpose. She is 56 years old and the mother of five children, two of whom are employed in a garment factory, two help their parents on the plantation, and the youngest one is attending the local school. Mr. Saret R. did not come to take a loan but his wife did, so she is presented in the picture instead of him.\r\n\r\nThis is a village bank loan consisting of mainly end-of-term loans. Four members have end-of-term loans and the rest have monthly payment loans. They are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK\u2019s main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time. AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09%, and AMK has a default rate of 0% on

S\u00e1bado is able to earn a monthly income of 15,000.00 MT, but is still not able to save any money. \r\n\r\nThis is S\u00e1bado\u2019s third loan through Hluvuku and his first with Kiva. His dream is to increase his business so that in the future he can open another establishment in a neighboring zone. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Jill Haring, Kiva

Every morning, she travels 15 kilometers to Ggaba \u2013 a landing site on the shores of Lake Victoria \u2013 to purchase various types of fish such as tilapia, nile perch, mukeene and kolongo. When she gets back to her stall she dries and smokes some of the tilapia and also slices some of the nile perch into small, affordable pieces of various sizes which she later deep fries in the evening from 5pm-9pm, her peak business hours. This is aimed at meeting the diverse tastes and preferences of her customers.  \r\n<p>\r\nFrom fish worth 100,000 Ugandan shillings (about USD$50), Revocate gets a profit of 50,000 shillings. At the moment, she is using the loan proceeds to purchase more fish hoping for increased sales and increased profits. She is a married mother of four and she also takes care of her parents. Her ambition is to become a supplier of both fish and green bananas to the market vendors. She hopes that when her dream comes true she will build a modern residence for her family.\r\n<p>\r\nRevocate will share this loan with the four other members of her

She attracts her customers by ensuring good services, attractive display, healthy fruits and a hygienic environment.  \r\n<p>\r\nVictor is using this loan to purchase bogoya and ndizi to add to her stock. She purchases the fruits from the Masaka suppliers. When she sells bananas worth 400,000 Ugandan shillings (about USD$200), she earns an average of 100,000 shillings profit. Her ambition is to remain in the same business but as a supplier. Being a single mother of four and a guardian to one orphan, she hopes that when she fulfills her ambition, she will be in a position to educate the five children and offer them a decent home and

Secondary School Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The members of this loan group are all teachers at the Ahmadiyya Secondary School in Makeni. The school was founded in 1984 by the Ahmadiyya Mission. Today, it has a total of 364 pupils with a staff of 10 teachers. The school carries a lot of pride for its ability to resurrect itself from the ruins of the civil war to become one of the most enviable schools in town. \r\n\r\nThis is the second time teachers from Ahmadiyya have received a loan from SMT. The previous loan was a great success to the first borrowers, hence three more staff have decided to join their colleagues this time around to borrow from SMT. Hawanatu S., for example, was able to start a small business using the previous loan. Today, her business serves as a supplementary source of income to her. Pa L. invested his money in agriculture and this has also served as an additional source of income to him outside of the classroom. \r\n\r\nFifty-one year old Naziru C. (on the left in the photo) is the principal at the school. He was born in Taiama, in the Moyamba district in southern Sierra Leone. He is married with five children. Two of the children are in junior secondary school, two are in senior secondary school and one is in college. His wife is also currently studying at the university. Naziru will use his loan to purchase house building materials, specifically cement for bricks and iron rods. He\u2019ll also hire four or five laborers to do the work. He wants to build an apartment adjacent to his home consisting of two rooms and a parlor. Naziru travels to Freetown every weekend where his family resides. He\u2019ll purchase the building materials there where the prices are lower relative to Makeni. A bag of cement, for example, will cost him 35,000 Leones (about USD$11.50) versus 45,000 to 50,000 in Makeni.\r\n\r\nGovernment salaries are usually quite small for teachers, thus making teaching an unattractive profession for many whose primary motivation is money. Many choose other jobs over teaching because of the small salary, thus starving the field of qualified personnel to teach the children. The few who remain in the classroom have to find other ways of making ends meet. The vast majority of them engage in either business or agriculture or they provide extra tutorial classes for the children (although this is a practice the government is trying to stop). Needless to say, loans from SMT are a great help to the teachers in order to boost their businesses or invest in something productive. Many want to do more schooling, but cannot afford the cost. Some want to buy pieces of furniture, but their monthly salary is not enough to let them do so. With a loan, they will be able to meet some of these needs. And with their monthly salaries, they can easily repay the loan via a payroll deduction type of system.\r\n\r\nIn 2003, after the rebel forces left the town, Ahmadiyya school could only boast of having five teachers, thus making the school\u2019s performance on national exams very poor. But with the intervention of the new principal, Naziru C., Ahmadiyya today has a total of 10 staff. In last year\u2019s national exams (also known as BECE \u2013 Basic Education Certification Examination) the school had two pupils who obtained some of the highest marks on the exams. This was a clear statement to bigger schools whose pupils could not score such high grades. \r\n\r\nIn the sporting arena, Ahamdiyya Secondary School is the current holder of the soccer competition trophy organized by the Ministry of Education, Youths and Sports for Junior Secondary Schools. They defeated the AL-Harrkan Secondary School. Because of all their hard work and dedication to both academics and extra-curricular activities, the school was upgraded to a senior secondary school by the Ministry of Education last academic year.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3200,"image":{"id":249924,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction Supplies","sector":"Construction","use":"To buy building materials such as cements and rods and to pay laborers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Makeni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.883333 -12.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2009-01-02T23:10:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Naziru ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Victor U.","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hawanatu ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leslie M.","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Momoh E.","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martin A.","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Daimba A.","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alimamy H.s","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Abdul D.","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":9600000,"loan_amount":3200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1066666.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1066666.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1066666.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1066666.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1066666.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1066666.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1066666.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1066666.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1066666.64}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":355.56},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":355.55},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":355.56},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":355.55},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":355.56},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":355.55},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":355.56},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":355.55},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":355.56}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":400,"local_amount":1200000,"processed_date":"2009-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-19T09:07:40Z","rounded_local_amount":1208400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14885077,"comment":null},{"amount":666.67,"local_amount":2000000.01,"processed_date":"2009-03-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:46:54Z","rounded_local_amount":2014000.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27128919,"comment":null},{"amount":355.55,"local_amount":1066666.67,"processed_date":"2009-04-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:14:13Z","rounded_local_amount":1074133.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36025708,"comment":null},{"amount":577.78,"local_amount":1733333.32,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T23:53:38Z","rounded_local_amount":1745466.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53008512,"comment":null},{"amount":488.89,"local_amount":1466666.69,"processed_date":"2009-07-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:23:31Z","rounded_local_amount":1476933.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63230853,"comment":null},{"amount":355.55,"local_amount":1066666.67,"processed_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:38:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1074133.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73662620,"comment":null},{"amount":355.56,"local_amount":1066666.64,"processed_date":"2009-09-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-17T10:57:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1074133.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87102857,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-01-03T15:21:21Z","paid_date":"2009-10-17T10:57:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":82141,"name":"Yihya","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Yihya is a 42-year-old man who lives in Saida, southern Lebanon with his wife and their two children.
