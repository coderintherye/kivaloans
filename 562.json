She earns her living by buying and selling palm toddy (palm wine) and operating a general store. Her husband Francisco, who is 59 years old, works as a driver to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have one child who is 22 years old. Nenita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2010 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her first loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Nenita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow.

The money she earns is used to pay her children's school fees. \r\n\r\nShe has applied for a loan from Kiva partner Asasah for her husband who wants to buy silver and beads for making jewelry such as bangles, earrings, etc. This will help him provide better quality services to his customers and make more profits. He has been operating this business for the past 30 years and Abida is hopeful that this investment will be a productive one for him. \r\n\r\nShe is a regular loan user of Asasah and this is her 5th loan application.

T. is a 50-year-old farmer who lives in the north of Kyrgyzstan. She is widowed and has four grow-up children; her youngest son lives with her and helps in the household. In 1998, in order to support her family and cover all expenses, Sharshengul decided to start her own cattle breeding business. With a starting capital of 20,000 KGS, she managed to expand her farm. To reduce expenses for the livestock's foraging, she pastured it in mountainous areas with native grasses. With her business revenues, she was able to provide her children with all they needed.\r\n<br>Sharshengul's farm now amounts to one cow and two calves. She plans to use this loan of 50,000 KGS to buy more cattle. With the revenues from the loan, she plans to broaden her business and buy a car for transporting milk and meat products to other regions. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About Bai-Tushum and Partners<\/b><br>\r\nBai-Tushum and Partners uses Kiva funding to target the especially vulnerable population.

N. is 22 years old, married and has a one-year-old daughter. She would like to give her daughter a good education to university level. Everline's business is located at Eregi in Kakamega, a region in Kenya known for sugarcane production and normally referred to as the 'sugarbelt' region. For the past three years she has owned a general store in which she sells items such as detergents, soft drinks, rice, sugar etc. to local people.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Margaret owns a grocery kiosk in which she sells fruits and vegetables to the local people. She has been in this business for the past five years. She states that her business is profitable and the major challenge she faces is the harassment from the local administration. She is requesting a  loan of 20,000 KES to buy more groceries to expand her business. She also plans to use the remainder of the money to purchase a cow from which she will be getting milk. She hopes to be a wholesaler in future. She also hopes to give all her children a quality education to the university level.

He makes and sells fast food in his business called \u201cDonde Rosenberg.\u201d He started two years ago selling deditos (cookies) by the tray.  However, because he\u2019s very curious and forward looking he took a fast food preparation course and asked his father for help.  His father gave him the money to buy a hotdog cart and some chairs.   \r\n\r\nThis is how he started to include hotdogs, salchipapas (fried potatoes with fried sausage), hamburgers and grilled meat and chicken skewers to his fast food.  A relative currently helps him with the work.  He also takes advantage of his sales point to sell minutes of cell phone air time which is an additional source of income.  He pays cash for his purchases and is determined to grow permanently.  This is why he\u2019s asking Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo for his first loan because he needs to do some improvements on his hotdog cart and buy raw materials to increase his working capital.\r\n\r\nRosemberg is very proud of his business because it\u2019s helped him pay his university expenses.  He is concentrating on becoming a Lawyer and to strengthening his business style trough modernization.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":731077,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"to improve his hotdog cart and to buy raw materials.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-03-14T19:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosemberg","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":800000,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":73340},{"due_date":"2011-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":74745},{"due_date":"2011-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":76178},{"due_date":"2011-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":77638},{"due_date":"2011-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":79126},{"due_date":"2011-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":80643},{"due_date":"2011-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":82188},{"due_date":"2011-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":83764},{"due_date":"2011-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":85369},{"due_date":"2012-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":87009}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.25},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.05},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.85},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.51},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.36},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.23},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.12},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.02},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.94}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":41.25,"local_amount":73340,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:04:36Z","rounded_local_amount":76752.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206157459,"comment":null},{"amount":42.05,"local_amount":74745,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:17:45Z","rounded_local_amount":78222.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211230471,"comment":null},{"amount":42.85,"local_amount":76178,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:08:45Z","rounded_local_amount":79722.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216509328,"comment":null},{"amount":43.67,"local_amount":77638,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:49:26Z","rounded_local_amount":81250.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221673548,"comment":null},{"amount":44.51,"local_amount":79126,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:01:52Z","rounded_local_amount":82807.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227320105,"comment":null},{"amount":45.36,"local_amount":80643,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:07:04Z","rounded_local_amount":84395.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232803243,"comment":null},{"amount":190.31,"local_amount":338330,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:17:26Z","rounded_local_amount":354072.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238614328,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-03-16T09:09:10Z","paid_date":"2011-11-15T10:17:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":281699,"name":"Samuel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Don Samuel, de 40 a\u00f1os de edad, reside en Usulut\u00e1n, vive con su esposa  y tres hijos de 17, 14 y 11 a\u00f1os de edad, tienen casa propia desde hace 16 a\u00f1os, \u00e9l se dedica a la agricultura y ganader\u00eda, la agricultura la inicio hace 11 a\u00f1os y la ganader\u00eda hace 5 a\u00f1os, este es el trabajo de don Samuel al que le dedica su tiempo y del cual recibe los ingresos necesarios para cubrir las necesidades del hogar.\nActualmente solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para comprar insumos para sembrar ma\u00edz, este pr\u00e9stamo la ayudara a adquirir el abono y fertilizantes para dar los cuidados necesarios a la milpa.\nDon Samuel espera que esta siembra le de buenos frutos, una cosecha abundante.\n","en":"Samuel is 40 years old and he lives in Usulutan.

Initially she worked as a domestic worker for two years, during which time she perfected her way of preparing meals.  She therefore stopped this activity and joined with her current spouse who was devoted to her.  At first she sold servings of soup, and today's main activity is the sale of lunches on a daily basis to 35 construction workers.  She has added to this the sale of cheese fingers and cold drinks, especially beer, on the weekends, when she sells at least 30 cases.  She also offers cell phone services, an activity that provides additional income.  Her daughter supports her in this business, she is paid daily and is directly employed by the business.\r\n\r\nEna Luz is now the mother of 5 children aged between 6 to 21 years.  Three of them live in another town with their grandparents.  She dreams of them all achieving success and being able to study and become professionals.  Ena therefore directs all her efforts to make this happen through daily hard work, and she is supported in this by her husband who works as a janitor at a construction firm. \r\n\r\nThis is the first funding she has received from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, with which she will buy non-perishable products such as rice, oil, grain and beer at wholesale.

She lives with her husband and their two little children in a house inherited from her parents. Since her childhood, she has worked in the fields. Her parents and her husband support her in this work. Thus she has now also planted potatoes, corn, and greens such as spinach, products that are sold in the city. In the same way, she stores part of her crops for their own consumption. As it is an arduous and slow work, in which she has to wait a considerable time until she can harvest, she meanwhile takes advantage of this time to sell articles of clothing to her regular customers, who are generally people whom she already knows and are very responsible in their payments. She confirms that she likes to do these jobs because she has at hand the foods for their own consumption, in addition to the future earnings from the sale of the products she harvests.

Since he was a very young boy he has learned about agriculture. His origins were in a rural environment and it has granted him the ability to dedicate himself to planting and harvesting a variety of products in his region, such as: potatoes, corn, peas, wheat, fava beans and others. But two years ago he decided to make himself independent in his business. Thanks to his constant dedication and the arduous work he invested in his plantations his first harvest was a great success. This encouraged him to continue and to stay in the field of agriculture.  The income that he earns from the sale of his harvests is supplemented with the work he carries out as a dental technician making dentures, a venture that is very profitable. This is his seventh loan with MFP and he is one of the individuals who have a good grasp on having a group loan through the communal bank.

This is why she is requesting a Kiva loan which will be her first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.

They primarily have independent businesses to generate income for the support of their home. In this environment Margarita has a small business from where she sells various articles that are brought from the city of Mendellin, especially clothing. The business was started given Margarita's independent nature, which she applied to her income generating activity. It was for the ultimate benefit of her family. She started out slowly, selling clothing, shoes, and perfumes to her neighbors and friends. Later, with the help of recommendations, she managed to join the market of company employees, who today are her main clients. Some of her clients have succeeded with her husband\u2019s recommendation. He works in a company and he supports her in her ideas. Margarita now sells everything that has been requested. She takes an order and she makes a very opportune effort.  This makes her a very strong competitor in the market. This is her eleventh loan with Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo (Kiva Field Partner) and it is her first with Kiva, with which she will invest in the purchase of clothing in Mendellin at a good price. She will see an increase in her earnings. With the previous loans she has managed to strengthen her independence and to support her family with her income.

The most difficult part of the work has to transport the products form her community all the way to the distribution centers located in Quimbiri and San Francisco. This is where she gets better prices for her products. Her difficulties lie in not being able to count on financial resources to cover the advance payment required by the laborers who help her with her harvest. This is the reason why she requests a loan from MFP (Kiva Field Partner). But her trop priority now is to plant more coffee on a hectare of land that is not cultivated. This is the first loan that Lisbeth has with MFP and she knows that if she pays it on time she will be able to access future loan with greater ease. With the 1500 nuevos soles she requests she will hire laborers to help her harvest coffee grains.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":731190,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to hire day workers to help with the coffee harvest","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-03-16T17:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lisbeth ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":141.86},{"due_date":"2011-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":151.98},{"due_date":"2011-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":154.26},{"due_date":"2011-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":159.84},{"due_date":"2011-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":166.69},{"due_date":"2011-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":171.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":178.53},{"due_date":"2011-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":184.34},{"due_date":"2011-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":190.83}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.02},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.72},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.56},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.61},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.12},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.95},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.46},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.59},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.97}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":52.02,"local_amount":141.86,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:31:34Z","rounded_local_amount":143.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206196376,"comment":null},{"amount":55.72,"local_amount":151.98,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:41:48Z","rounded_local_amount":154.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211270057,"comment":null},{"amount":55.29,"local_amount":150.78,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:32:11Z","rounded_local_amount":153.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216550074,"comment":null},{"amount":60.37,"local_amount":164.64,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:13:29Z","rounded_local_amount":167.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221718750,"comment":null},{"amount":63.1,"local_amount":172.09,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:49Z","rounded_local_amount":174.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350204,"comment":null},{"amount":263.5,"local_amount":718.65,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:49:07Z","rounded_local_amount":729.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232850692,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-03-17T01:53:21Z","paid_date":"2011-10-15T09:49:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":281769,"name":"Gumercinda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"la sra.

","en":"Viviana E. has a business in the center of Barranquilla, in the commercial area of the city.  There she makes women's, men's and children's clothes.  She has gained experience in her business.  She used to work in a dressmaking workshop and learned the manufacturing process and also how to sell.  She then set up her own workshop.  At first she worked with a partner but her commitment and motivation to grow and make more income in order to provide for her 12 year-old daughter's well-being and education, drove her to start working independently.  She undertook her great challenge, supported by Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, an organization from which she has received 7 loans and managed to increase her infrastructure.  She acquired machines that helped her to reduce her production time and increase the quality of her garments.  She was also able to buy raw materials in larger volumes which helped her to have a better range of products to offer.\r\n\r\nAlthough everything Viviana has done hasn't been successful, she has always managed to get ahead.  For example, she spent a lot of money in dissolving her partnership and she wanted to set up a store but it was not successful.  Viviana is always motivated to make progress because she has a daughter for whom she is solely responsible and because her business principles for personal improvement demand it.  For this reason, her highest priority is to manage to turn her small workshop into a large garment factory which provides lots of people with a source of income and benefits Colombian families.  Viviana will gradually work towards achieving this goal.  She will use her Kiva loan to buy fabrics and supplies for making bags with the aim of starting to diversify her product

","en":"Maria C. R. is 27-years-old and she works as a fishmonger. She lives with her spouse and 5-year-old son in the municipality of Malambo in the metropolitan area of Barranquilla. Maria began this business 7 years ago with $500,000 COP (Colombian currency). She had this wild idea when she was visiting her family for Christmas in her native El Banco Magdalena. She often returned from there with fish for her home and ended up selling them among her close friends. From that moment on it has gone very well for her. She works with her spouse and her goal is to increase her merchandise and sales. Maria is young and very dynamic. She currently sells fish in bulk in the market plaza, but she also generates income selling varied merchandise from her home. She currently brings the fish from El Banco Magdaleno, but recently she has found a way to buy it that is more economical if she were able to bring it from Zapatoca, a municipality in the department of Ces\u00e1r. This is her objective in requesting her first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo--that her husband will be able to travel directly to this location and do direct business, which will benefit her and her customers in terms of price and quality. This investment would be successful because Holy Week is approaching, a time when sales of this product increase because many people don't eat red meat on certain days, so fish forms part of the diet of many families that preserve this tradition.

He lives with Luisa, 32, and their 4 children, who are the joy of their home.  They live in their own home in the community of Pataccocha, an annex of the Santa Rosa district.  Marcial is a resourceful man who puts a lot of care into the work that he does.  He works in agriculture, and has 4 hectares of land where he cultivates cocoa, barbasco (a plant used to make a natural temporary poison used in fishing), and coca leaves.  He has been doing this kind of work for 10 years, and so now is very knowledgeable about farming.  During the harvest season, he hires worker to help him with the harvest.  His most profitable products are the coffee beans and the coca leaves, because the wholesale firms that buy the products pay him well for each kilogram.  The problem with his work is that he must fight against the insects that damage the fruits of his plants.  The loan requested is to acquire more cocoa seedlings to plant, so that he can get the most fruit out of his plants in less time.  But now, his priority is to buy new land so that he can expand his cultivations and increase his production.  This is his first loan with MFP, and he knows that he has the responsibility to make all of his payments on time and he is ready to do this.  He feels very grateful to the institution for granting him the loan that he requested.

They live in their own house located in the Miraflores community in the San Francisco district.\r\n<p>\r\nWith a lot of hard work, Nilo has succeeded in tilling his land in order to make it very productive.  He is a farmer engaged in raising coffee and timber-producing trees such as tornillo, cedar, and mahogany.  These are sustainable crops which generate good income.  At harvest time and when the trees are cut down, he has to hire workers to help him transport the heavy sacks of coffee and take blocks of wood from his farm to the place where they are transferred to vehicles.\r\n<p>\r\nHe has worked in the fields for 15 years and in this time has gained a lot of experience.

is a married woman who lives in Badian, Cebu. She earns her living by operating a general store and a food vending business. Her husband Romeo, who is 44 years old, works as a municipal driver to earn his living.  They have two children who are 7 and 15 years old. Belinda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Belinda has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 12,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 5,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her fifth loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000 to buy stock for the general store so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Belinda is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her

Tasleem couldn\u2019t provide an education to her elder children due to financial constraints but she wants her younger children to complete their education and become successful in their lives.\r\n\r\nHer husband\u2019s name is M. A. and he works in a thread-making business. He is illiterate and made this business to earn money for his family. Tasleem is very supportive in nature.  In addition to her household work, she also supports her husband in making thread. They get thread from the old warm clothes such as sweaters and sell them to the thread sellers of the market for a profit.\r\n\r\nShe has applied for a loan from Kiva partner Asasah for the improvement of her husband\u2019s business. With the loan, he will buy sweaters in larger quantity to get thread and to fulfill larger orders on time. Her husband has good business contacts and is hopeful that an investment will be productive for his business growth. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":731441,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"to buy sweaters for thread-making business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PK","country":"Pakistan","town":"Kasur","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"31.115556 74.446667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":60,"posted_date":"2011-03-15T11:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tasleem ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PKR","disbursal_amount":40000,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3650},{"due_date":"2011-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3650},{"due_date":"2011-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3650},{"due_date":"2011-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3650},{"due_date":"2011-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":3650},{"due_date":"2011-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3650},{"due_date":"2011-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3650},{"due_date":"2011-11-06T07:00:00Z","amount":3650},{"due_date":"2011-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":3650},{"due_date":"2012-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3650},{"due_date":"2012-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":3500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.34},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.35},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.34},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.35},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.34},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.34},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.35},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.34},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.34},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.35},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.56}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":43.34,"local_amount":3650,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:14:47Z","rounded_local_amount":3686.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206099555,"comment":null},{"amount":43.35,"local_amount":3650,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:34:11Z","rounded_local_amount":3686.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211169958,"comment":null},{"amount":43.34,"local_amount":3650,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:34:10Z","rounded_local_amount":3686.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216452701,"comment":null},{"amount":43.35,"local_amount":3650,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:19:23Z","rounded_local_amount":3686.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221616656,"comment":null},{"amount":43.34,"local_amount":3650,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:27:32Z","rounded_local_amount":3686.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":226985785,"comment":null},{"amount":43.34,"local_amount":3650,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:21:56Z","rounded_local_amount":3686.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232744630,"comment":null},{"amount":43.35,"local_amount":3650,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:24:31Z","rounded_local_amount":3686.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238549115,"comment":null},{"amount":43.34,"local_amount":3650,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:18:00Z","rounded_local_amount":3686.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244507912,"comment":null},{"amount":43.34,"local_amount":3650,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:21:42Z","rounded_local_amount":3686.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250715588,"comment":null},{"amount":43.35,"local_amount":3650,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:32:42Z","rounded_local_amount":3686.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257118489,"comment":null},{"amount":41.56,"local_amount":3500,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:33:23Z","rounded_local_amount":3534.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263243538,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-03-15T19:39:54Z","paid_date":"2012-03-15T08:33:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":281871,"name":"Flora","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Flora S. is from the city of Tabid, Ozamiz City.

is 42 years old and has given birth to four children. All of them are enrolled in a local school and getting their education.  She does embroidery and stitching work at her home. She receives orders from her neighboring clients and completes the orders to earn an income for her family.  She belongs to Kasur, which is a small city of Punjab, Pakistan, which is famous for its leather industry. She has lived there for the past eighteen years in a small home which contains two rooms in the area of Bhutta sohan din.\r\n\r\nHer husband\u2019s name is Y. and he has two businesses. He supplies construction material to different construction companies on order. In addition, he sells animals to butchers after raising them up.\r\n \r\nSagheer has applied for a loan from the Kiva partner, Asasah, to further expand her husband\u2019s construction supplies business.

Without a doubt it is not an easy task, but love of family provides him with motivation and gives his work meaning. His wife helps him with the business.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian  <p>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

They know one another as neighbors and through ties of marriage and kinship. \r\n\r\nThey sell farming equipment (African and eye hoes), calabashes, groundnut paste, pasta, tea and sugar. In order to increase their working capital, the group decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso microfinance institution. They are on their first loan cycle. \r\n\r\nMrs. Yaya C. is known in the village and surrounding areas for selling pasta. She plans to use her loan to buy a sack of wheat flour to make pasta. She gets her wheat flour at the grand market of S\u00e9gou, and then turns it into pasta (vermicelli, macaroni, etc.). \r\n\r\nShe kneads the wheat flour with water, and then the dough is handled to slowly go through a small device. It comes out the machine in a pre-set shape. Then, the dough is laid out to dry in the sun for at least six hours. This is followed by packaging in plastic bags, ready to be sold. \r\n\r\nShe sells for cash or credit, from her home, and also at the Pelengana market and nearby villages, to a clientele composed of both men and women. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Mrs. Yaya C. hopes to earn an average monthly profit of 20,000 FCFA to be used for reinvestment in the business and small household expenses. She hopes that her collaboration with Soro Yiriwaso will help her to become a wholesaler in her business

She began the fruit selling business when she was 29 years old with loans and on credit, selling to the best distributors.  Her first business was selling on foot in an open air market, also handicrafts, and sewing with a machine as she knows how to do tailoring work.  She didn't manage to finish primary school as her parents were poor, and this was a luxury and she couldn't have.  Therefore, she dedicated herself to work.  Currently, she sells fruit and trees like fruit plants, ornamentals, flowers, etc.  Two of her children help her with this work.  The others work for themselves and are independent.  She sells fruit and plants in the central street in front of her house, also she is the owner of two units which she rents to have another source of income.\r\n\r\nShe is asking for this loan in order to buy fruit, vegetables, and an awning to protect the fruits from the sun that currently shines directly on her fruits.

They contribute and together they want to progress. Since she was very young, this enterprising woman she learned from her father when he made curtains. Since then it has been her focus to learn to sew. When she needed to provide for her children she had no doubt about using the skills that she learned and she started making articles of clothing. She is very happy because she has various orders that are placed for the season and she tries to fill them all with the help of her 15-year old daughter who excels in using the sewing machine.  She says that the schools in the region also place orders for jackets and school uniforms which is why she often has orders. But this time she has received a large order and she doesn't have the capital funds to fill it, which is why she requests a loan. For the future she plans on purchasing two sewing machines so that her eldest daughter will help her and therefore continue progressing in the business. Maria plans on investing the loan she requests on purchasing a variety of fabrics that she needs to keep making articles of clothing, and in this manner continue to advance.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":731786,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cloth & Dressmaking
