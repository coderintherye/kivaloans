This is 27-year-old Grace D. from Tukuyu. She is single. Grace has been running a \"genge\" business since 2005. The Swahili word for this type of outside shop, or stall, is genge. A genge is usually a very basic structure made of wood, with a tin roof, which sells general items such as onions, tomatoes, chili, oil, rice, and dried fish. It is the kind of place local people send their children running to fetch something when they are in the middle of cooking the evening meal, and don\u2019t have time to go all the way to the market to buy the missing ingredient. <P>\r\n\r\nGrace works at the business for 9-12 hours per day, six days per week. Grace currently earns about 300 USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of 325 USD in order to purchase sugar, rice beans, cooking oil,chili, and and other items for her business. In the future, she plans to increase the variety and quantity of her inventory. Grace thanks you for your support!<P>\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:<P>\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. <P>\r\n\r\nCustoms and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. \r\n\r\n<P>One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":256315,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To

Todo este tiempo ha trabajado en la compra y venta de fruta de acuerdo a la temporada, y hay d\u00edas en que tiene que ir a las chacras a las 4.00am para comprar a los agricultores que ya tienen preparando sus productos para el mejor postor, por ello que Silvia tiene que madrugar para seleccionar las frutas y luego comprarlas. Para Silvia, a\u00f1os atr\u00e1s esta labor le parec\u00eda muy pesada, pero ya se adecu\u00f3 porque le es mucho m\u00e1s rentable, sobre todo en los meses de enero a marzo cuando vende frutas c\u00edtricas, luego viene la temporada de los pl\u00e1tanos hasta los meses de mayo, en este tiempo no va mucho a las chacras, solo espera comprar de los que llevan al mercado, llegando a vender solo de 20 a 25 javas de frutas, cada java consta de 12 kilos de naranjas o mandarinas. Mientras que est\u00e1 bien la demanda en el mercado la venta de frutas le sale el doble de ganancia, o de lo contrario busca vender paltas que son mucho m\u00e1s delicadas. Lo dificultoso en este negocio es que las frutas de malogran, y a veces se compra a un precio, y luego baja, entonces pierden parte de su capital; a pesar de estos altibajos, Silvia est\u00e1 feliz con su actividad porque le permite llevar una vida decorosa. Silvia hace uso de un cr\u00e9dito de MFP por la quinta vez consecutiva, todo este tiempo ha pagado con mucha responsabilidad todas las cuotas fijadas y jam\u00e1s cayo en morosidad. El dinero solicitado lo derivar\u00e1 a la compra de fruta por camionadas, para que de este modo las env\u00ede directamente a la capital, ya que ganar\u00e1 mucho m\u00e1s que en su puesto y en un menor tiempo.","en":"Silvia is 33 years old and has lived with her common-law husband for 13 years.  They have three children and one on the way.  All this time Silvia has dealt in seasonal fruit, and there are days when she has to be at the farms at 4:00 a.m. to buy from farmers who sell to the highest bidder.  For this reason she has to be up early to choose the fruit and then purchase it. In the past this work seemed very burdensome, but she has become accustomed to it because it is more profitable.  In general she sells citrus fruit from January to March, then banana season runs until May.  During that time she does not go to the farms frequently, but waits to buy from those who bring 20-25 javas of fruit to the market. Each java is equivalent to 12 kilograms of oranges or tangerines. When demand in the marketplace is high, she makes double the profit from the sale of fruit. When it is not, she tries to sell avocados, which are more delicate. What is difficult about this business is that fruit spoils, and at times one buys at one price, but then it drops, resulting in a loss of capital. Despite the ups and downs, Silvia is content with her business because it permits her to lead a decent life. This is the fifth time in a row that Silvia has taken out a loan with Kiva, and each time she has made her loan payments and never fallen into arrears.  The money that she has requested will go towards the purchase of fruit by the truckload, because this way she can send it directly to the capital where it will earn much more in a shorter period of time than if she sold it from her stall.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Joyce ., Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":256549,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase of fruit to send to Lima for sale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-01-19T14:50:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":975,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Silvia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":97.5,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-01-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:09:13Z","rounded_local_amount":307.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10228399,"comment":null},{"amount":97.5,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:07:25Z","rounded_local_amount":307.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20423634,"comment":null},{"amount":97.5,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:39:57Z","rounded_local_amount":307.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116902,"comment":null},{"amount":97.5,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:49:15Z","rounded_local_amount":307.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011824,"comment":null},{"amount":97.5,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:02:17Z","rounded_local_amount":307.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595417,"comment":null},{"amount":97.5,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:42:53Z","rounded_local_amount":307.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989658,"comment":null},{"amount":97.5,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:43:57Z","rounded_local_amount":307.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210788,"comment":null},{"amount":97.5,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:24:56Z","rounded_local_amount":307.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640417,"comment":null},{"amount":97.5,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-09-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:37:54Z","rounded_local_amount":307.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080081,"comment":null},{"amount":97.5,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-10-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:09:40Z","rounded_local_amount":307.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996401,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-01-19T16:10:59Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T03:09:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":84220,"name":"Marisol Genoveva","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Joven Empresaria Marisol Genoveva C.

A few years ago she worked here and there wherever the opportunity arose, but since she became engaged, she has been a housewife. Two months ago she started selling donuts using her mother-in-law's stove to cook them; currently she only cooks during week-ends, the rest of the week only making pork rinds, which she sells for 1.00 to 1.50 soles. Helen's husband (partner) is a farmer, and they have just started planting citric fruits, but they have to wait about 4 or 5 more years to harvest the fruit. Meanwhile, she has seen it fit to dedicate herself completely to the food business, but realizes that it is not lucrative to sell only during week-ends, so she has decided to do it daily at her doorstep between the hours of 6 and 11 PM . Helen hopes to have good fortune in capturing clientele quickly. She has joined this community bank which is in its fifth loan cycle, the first for her, and she vows to make payments on time in hopes to continue to qualify for future loans.

She now only goes out about 2-3 times per week, earning between 150-200 soles each time, spending the rest of time repackaging the spices. Betty is very happy with her work, has had no difficulties, and wants to increase her capital and take her business to areas where there is no competition. This is her second loan through MFP, and she is committed to continue paying on time and being a good customer. The money requested will be used to buy more merchandise such as thread, buttons, snaps and other spices in order to grow her customer base. She also would like in time to be able to travel to the capital city to buy her products at a cheaper cost.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Monica Hayden, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":256555,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Incremento de la mercader\u00eda que vende","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-01-16T21:30:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Betty","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":650,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:43:00Z","rounded_local_amount":2047.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989660,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-01-16T22:54:14Z","paid_date":"2009-07-15T22:43:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":84225,"name":"Pedro Sergio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"u nombre es Pedro Sergio G. su edad es de 64 a\u00f1os, su estado civil es casado, Don Pedro tiene 4 hijos de los cuales todos son casados y viven de manera independiente, su compa\u00f1era de vida labora de costurera ejerciendo la actividad econ\u00f3mica en su casa de habitaci\u00f3n  ya que ambos les gusta realizar trabajos humildes pero dignos, los prop\u00f3sitos de Don Pedro es mantener estable su negocio debido al precio del combustible que no se encuentra estable y esto ocasiona inestabilidad para su familia, sus sue\u00f1os son de que sus hijos cuenten con otra fuente de ingresos para que el d\u00eda de ma\u00f1ana este no sea un inconveniente para ellos mismos su deseo es de tener suficiente dinero para suplir las necesidades de su familia por lo que en estos momentos la compra para los productos b\u00e1sicos es mas costosa por lo que cada d\u00eda la vida esta mas dif\u00edcil y es por eso que necesita luchar para mantener a su familia.\n\nLa actividad econ\u00f3mica a la que se dedica es conduciendo un taxi, el tiempo que tiene de poseer su negocio es de 27 a\u00f1os, la ubicaci\u00f3n de su negocio es de forma ambulante, Don Pedro inicia este negocio por la necesidad de adquirir una fuente de ingresos para su familia ya que tenia que proporcionar el sustento diario por lo que por medio de un amigo adquiri\u00f3 el derecho de la ruta con un dinero que le prestaron por un familiar sin intereses y con las ganancias que generara  el negocio pagar\u00eda el dinero por lo que desde esos momentos se convirti\u00f3 en una persona emprendedora por lo que tenia a sus 4 hijos a su cargo y tenia que prepararlos profesionalmente durante estos 27 a\u00f1os Don Pedro a cambiado su unidad de transporte en 4 ocasiones y esto sucedi\u00f3 a la exigencias de la cooperativa donde esta afiliado y debido a la necesidad de ofrecer un mejor servicio a los usuarios por lo que todav\u00eda necesita realizar un financiamiento destinado para             las reparaciones del vehiculo por lo que tiene que buscar los repuestos en Managua ya que ah\u00ed le resulta mas favorable la compra de estos repuestos.","en":"His name is Pedro Sergio G.. He is 64 years old and married. Don Pedro has four children, all of whom are married and live on their own. His life partner works as a seamstress in their one-room house, since both of them wish to do humble but dignified work. Don Pedro's goal is to keep his business stable even though the price of fuel fluctuates and causes instability for his family. His dream is for his children to have another source of income so that in the future this fluctuation doesn't cause them any problems. For himself and his partner he dreams of having enough money to provide for his family's needs, since purchasing basic staples has become more expensive. This makes life more and more difficult and obliges him to struggle to support his family.\r\n\r\nHe earns a living as a taxi driver. He's had his business for 27 years. Don Pedro began the business in order to create a source of income for his family, since he needed to provide for their day-to-day needs. Through a friend he managed to acquire the route rights with money loaned to him interest-free by a relative, and with the profits the business generates he'd repay the loan. So from that moment he became an enterprising person, having four children to take care of and prepare for the world of work. Over the past 27 years Don Pedro has changed vehicles four times, as required by the cooperative with which he is associated, in order to offer better service to his clients. He seeks financing to pay for vehicle repairs, for which he'll have to look for parts in Managua, since they can be found at more affordable prices there.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Andrea Rosenberg, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":256554,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","use":"vehicle repairs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-01-18T15:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pedro Sergio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":7000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2009-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2009-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2009-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2009-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":875}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":46.87,"local_amount":875,"processed_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:41:01Z","rounded_local_amount":936.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20399986,"comment":null},{"amount":55.48,"local_amount":1035.67,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:38:27Z","rounded_local_amount":1107.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27091984,"comment":null},{"amount":38.26,"local_amount":714.33,"processed_date":"2009-04-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:38:33Z","rounded_local_amount":764.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35985368,"comment":null},{"amount":46.88,"local_amount":875,"processed_date":"2009-05-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:09:30Z","rounded_local_amount":936.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44445984,"comment":null},{"amount":46.88,"local_amount":875,"processed_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:39:29Z","rounded_local_amount":936.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52956625,"comment":null},{"amount":140.63,"local_amount":2625,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T13:59:47Z","rounded_local_amount":2808.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63174052,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

They have two handsome sons and now they are building a wooden house. Her parents did agricultural work for a living, which was their only source of income. The years passed and Eva fell in love with a very hardworking and responsible farmer. In the time they have been together, they have proposed goals to advance and develop in the competitive market. They work in the business of buying and selling fruit. Her husband plants citrus fruits and sometimes he buys fruit from their neighbors. Buying from small farms is convenient for them, since it is less of an investment. They invest 1000 soles in citrus fruits and their earnings are 600 (soles), discounting all expenses. What they also do is buy green plantains and by using a liquid called Etrel, the plantains mature before their time. This investment costs 3 soles, and it is very profitable as well. Eva is another client who is very timely with her payments, and she is also a very active member of her communal bank. She participates in all activities that the loan analysts do, and she is always is ready to lend a hand. She plans to invest the money she's requesting by purchasing a fruit truck that she will later send to the market in Lima.

loan for various purposes. For example, Mr. Sarom R., the 43-year-old village bank president, is a motorbike taxi driver. He now faces a problem because his motorbike is an old one and he usually pays a lot of money to repair it. Thus, he is requesting a loan to fix his motorbike. His wife, Mrs. Ngon Chanthon, is a housewife. Mr. Sarom R. is the father of a child who is attending the local school. <P>\r\n\r\nThree members in this group loans have end-of-term loans and the rest have monthly payment loans. The EoT borrowers are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK\u2019s main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time. AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09% and AMK has a default rate of 0% on Kiva.

Before, her family had a very difficult time because there wasn't enough fund to invest in any business, while her children are all small.  In 2005 Mrs. L. joined TYM Fund (Kiva Partner in Vietnam) to loan some money to sell mats.  The business has been going pretty well and brought a steady source of income to her family, about 400,000VND (about 238 USD) per month.  She wants to borrow 8,000,000 VND (or 475 USD) to have more funds to invest in her business and bring more income to her family.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by Phuong Nguyen, Kiva

This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. <P>\r\n\r\nOne of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":256693,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cloth & Dressmaking Supplies","sector":"Retail","use":" To buy more fabrics for making clothes for re-sale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-01-18T15:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Face","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:04:40Z","rounded_local_amount":52000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436433,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:57:44Z","rounded_local_amount":52000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130705,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:26:50Z","rounded_local_amount":52000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027502,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:15:32Z","rounded_local_amount":52000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613503,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:03:21Z","rounded_local_amount":52000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010582,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:39:36Z","rounded_local_amount":52000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232873,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:53:43Z","rounded_local_amount":52000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664674,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-09-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:47:42Z","rounded_local_amount":52000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105405,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:28:24Z","rounded_local_amount":52000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022550,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:42:22Z","rounded_local_amount":52000.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103867799,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-01-18T15:13:04Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T14:42:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":84256,"name":"Ageut-Esapan Alice Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":" Alice E.

from Tanzania!  This is 49 year old Rebecca N. from Mwanza. She is married with three children, between the ages of 25 and 28 years old. She is also responsible for supporting a dependant, a child whose parents could not look after. Rebecca N. has been running a Duka business. She owns a small duka or neighborhood shop in the city. She has been selling common household and grocery items since 2004. Rebecca's business is doing well. She works at her business for 13 hours a day, 7 days a week and currently earns about 144USD. She is requesting a loan of 400USD in order to buy more supplies of her shop like breads, soaps, sugar, biscuits, lotions, and cakes. In the future, she plans to expand her business. Rebecca thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA!\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.

This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. <P>\r\n\r\nOne of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":256706,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"To purchase fabrics such as kanga and vitenge to make clothing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-01-18T15:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pendo ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":400000,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":40000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:04:58Z","rounded_local_amount":42250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436436,"comment":null},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-03-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:57:37Z","rounded_local_amount":42250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130708,"comment":null},{"amount":32.49,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-04-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:26:58Z","rounded_local_amount":42250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027505,"comment":null},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-05-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:15:40Z","rounded_local_amount":42250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613506,"comment":null},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-06-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:03:04Z","rounded_local_amount":42250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010585,"comment":null},{"amount":32.51,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-07-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:39:49Z","rounded_local_amount":42250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232875,"comment":null},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-08-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:53:46Z","rounded_local_amount":42250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664676,"comment":null},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-09-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:47:34Z","rounded_local_amount":42250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105407,"comment":null},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:28:27Z","rounded_local_amount":42250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022552,"comment":null},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:42:04Z","rounded_local_amount":42250.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103867801,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-01-18T15:37:44Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T14:42:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":84262,"name":"Thanh Thi","description":{"languages":["vi","en"],"texts":{"vi":"Ch\u1ecb Ho\u00e0ng Th\u1ecb Th\u00e0nh, n\u0103m nay 44 tu\u1ed5i \u1edf Qu\u1ea3ng X\u01b0\u01a1ng Thanh Ho\u00e1.

Bertha thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:<P>\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback micro-finance facility. <P>\r\n\r\nCustoms and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. <P>\r\n\r\nOne of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":256712,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy more rice, soap, sugar, beans, and cooking oil for her inventory","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-01-18T15:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bertha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-03-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:53:00Z","rounded_local_amount":104000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130709,"comment":null},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:57:53Z","rounded_local_amount":104000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130710,"comment":null},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:27:26Z","rounded_local_amount":104000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027506,"comment":null},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-05-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:15:45Z","rounded_local_amount":104000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613507,"comment":null},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-06-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:03:28Z","rounded_local_amount":104000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010586,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-01-18T16:39:08Z","paid_date":"2009-07-16T00:03:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":84265,"name":"Nguyen Thi","description":{"languages":["vi","en"],"texts":{"vi":"Ch\u1ecb Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb H\u01b0\u01a1ngn\u0103m nay 35 tu\u1ed5i.

In 2003, she joined the TYM Fund and used a loan to invest in her family\u2019s business weaving straw mats.  Between this business and her husband\u2019s salary, the total income of her family is about 3,000,000 VND (175 USD) per month.

Evelyne thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA!\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

from Tanzania! This is 43 year old Sophia M. from Mwanza. She is a widow with four children, between the ages of 11 and 23 years old. Sophia M. has been running a Duka business- She owns a small duka or neighborhood shop in the city where she has been selling common household and grocery items since 2004. Sophia's business is doing well. She works at the business for 13 hours per day, 7 days per week. Sophia currently earns about 350usd from her business. She is requesting a loan of 400usd in order to buy more stock of her shop like breads, soaps, sugar, biscuits, lotions, and tomato sauces. In the future, she plans to expand her business. Sophia thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA!\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":256733,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy more stock of her shop like breads, soaps, sugar, biscuits, lotions, and tomato sauces","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-01-19T00:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sophia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-03-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:52:57Z","rounded_local_amount":105000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130713,"comment":null},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:57:50Z","rounded_local_amount":105000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130714,"comment":null},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:27:07Z","rounded_local_amount":105000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027508,"comment":null},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-05-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:16:07Z","rounded_local_amount":105000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613509,"comment":null},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-06-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:03:25Z","rounded_local_amount":105000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010588,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-01-19T01:16:12Z","paid_date":"2009-07-16T00:03:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":84277,"name":"Aisha's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"N.

is married and has two grown children and many grandchildren. This year she will be 60 years old.  She lives with her husband in a one bedroom apartment.   Nadiya sells children's clothing at the Melitopol central market. She started this business 8 years ago.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

N.  is a 38-year-old cattleman who is married with three children. Owing to his father, who was a farmer, Botirjon has been associated with this business since he was young. He purchases the cattle in the local market and then he fattens and sells them. The cattle are kept in the house and it takes a lot of effort to care for them.<P>\r\n\r\nEvery day, Botirjon gets up early in the morning in order to feed his animals. And all day, until late at night, he is busy looking after the cattle. Botirjon says that he works with only one aim in mind - to provide his children with a proper education. Now, Botirjon would like to expand his business and purchase three cows. For this purpose, he has applied for 4000 Somoni ($ 1175 USD) and with your help he hopes to reach his aim.   <P>\r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

offers taxi services in Isfara, Tajikistan. He has been working in this sphere of business for 4 years. Erkinjon admits he has benefited a lot from the financial assistance he has received from IMON International, Tajikistan. Currently, his business has grown to the point where he takes in 15 \u2013 20 $ per day. <P>\r\n\r\nErkinjon is hoping to buy a better and trendier vehicle in the future to offer more high-class services to his clients. Now his car needs thorough repairs for which he is requesting a loan. Erkinjon thinks that this loan will help him move closer to the fulfillment of his plans, as due to repairing his car, he will increase his clientele. Some day when Erkinjon saves enough, he is hoping to buy a newer but affordable vehicle.     <P>\r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Kanoat is 41 years old. She is married and has a child. Kanoat has been a running grocery store for the past 3 years. She sells sweets, preserved food, juices, soft drinks and also detergents in her store. The inventory she has for sale is of very good quality and selection. Kanoat is respectful and patient with all of her customers which attracts people and brings them back to her shop to buy groceries again. Kanoat is seeking to keep her business strong and has requested a loan of 3000 Somoni for the term of 7 months to increase the inventory she has for sale. We believe this current loan will enhance the potential of her business and help Kanoat reach all of her aspirations.    \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

On Thursdays, market day in S\u00e9gou, she is swamped by her many customers, mainly carters, chicken sellers and mothers.  She tells us that her name has the power to stop children's misbehaviour:  one has only to tell them that if they don't behave, they won't get any of A\u00efssata's juices.  She intends to expand her business using this loan which she is requesting as working capital from the microfinancial institution Soro Yiriwaso.  She has been working with this MFI for 30 months.  After having been a member of five group loans, all repaid, she is asking for this, her first individual loan for 250,000 FCFA with which she will buy 2 bags of sugar, 4 bags of powdered juice, 7 bundles of bags.  She buys her raw materials locally and always sells for cash.\r\n\r\nShe expects to make a profit of 75,0000 FCFA.  She will use this profit to pay for her children's schooling as they attend high school in  S\u00e9gou (fuel costs).<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Laure Kwon, Kiva

She left school during Grade 9 to get married.  She started making meatpies with her sister-in-law.  Her apprenticeship lasted only four days.  Since then she has been in high demand from services and NGOs (Non-Governmental Agencies) when they hold workshops and colloquiums.  She has many clients as she is well-known in her neighborhood.  In the evenings, she has many customers where she sells.\r\n\r\nTo make the meatpies, she uses the following:  3 kilograms of wheat flour; 1\/2 kilogram of ground meat, 30 eggs, butter, and 4 bowls of water.  Once everything is mixed to a paste, she places and cuts the wheat-flour paste in which the ground meat is embedded.  Once they are cooked, the meatpies can be eaten.\r\n\r\nTo satisfy her ever-increasing clientele, she is turning to the microfinancial institution Soro Yiriwaso.  She has been working with Soro Yiriwaso for 30 months.  She has three previous group loans and one previous individual loan, which have all been repaid.  This will be her second individual loan.\r\n\r\nShe will buy 50 kilograms of wheat flour, 3 drums of oil, 15 flats of eggs and meat on a daily basis.

He lives at his father's home, in a large traditional family together with his mother and his 5 brothers, in the S\u00e9bougou neighborhood in the city of S\u00e9gou (fourth administrative region of the Republic of Mali).\r\nHe dropped out of school in 8th grade to help his older brother who was running a retail shop. After two years of learning the ins and outs of this business, he's been running his own shop for 3 years, in the Angoul\u00eame neighborhood. His shop is located near CAN 2002 boulevard, the business center in S\u00e9gou. His shop is located next to a drugstore, a beverage store, and a hair salon. His revenues are very important since his shop is much frequented due to its accessibility, and also since he's got a high business sense.\r\nTo meet an ever-increasing customer demand, he turned to the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso seven months ago. After a first individual loan that was repaid without problems, he's now seeking his second individual loan.\r\nHe intends to use it to buy one ton of sugar, 3 boxes of pasta, and 10 boxes of green peas. He gets his supplies in Bamako (the capital of Mali) or directly in S\u00e9gou. Mr. Ousmane Ciss\u00e9 sells for cash and on credit to a clientele consisting of both men and women.\r\nHe foresees realizing a monthly profit of XOF 250'000 (ca US$ 500), which will enable him to help his father with the family expenses.

They have named their group Kara.  They are local entrepreneurs in the town of Makeni. Most recently; each of them in the group received a loan of Le 500,000. That loan was a great help to members of this group. It enabled them to expand their businesses, make more profit, and consequently improve their living conditions.  Having repaid their last loan successfully, they have requested a loan of Le 800,000. <P>\r\n\r\nAminata (right) is the leader of the group. She is forty-eight years of age. She was born in Makeni, in northern Sierra Leone. She is married and her husband is a working professional. They have four children \u2013 one is in college, and the three are in Junior Secondary School. Aminata sells palm-oil (the most popular cooking oil) and \u201cgara lappers\u201d (locally dyed cloth). She has been in the business for more than twenty years now.<P>\r\n\r\nWith this new loan, Aminata will expand her business. She will invest part of the money in her \"gara\" business and part in the palm-oil business. She will buy at least three lengths of white cotton (about thirty yards of white cotton make a length). A length costs Le 110,000. She will also use some of the money to buy ink, powder, soda and other chemicals used in dyeing the cloth. She will also have to pay workers who design some intricate patterns on the white cotton. All of the material she needs for making the \"gara\" she can purchase within Makeni town; for the palm-oil, she will have to travel to a village called Masingbin to buy it at a reasonable cost. She will need to pay a fare of Le 10,000 to travel to Masingbin. There, a \u201cbarter\u201d (five gallons) of palm-oil costs Le 60,000. <P>\r\n\r\nSo far, Aminata faces no major challenge in her business worth noting. Business is going on fine for her. She loves doing her business and would like to see it grow as it is her only source of survival. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":256990,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","use":"invest part on gara lappers and part on palm-oil","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Makeni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.883333 -12.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2009-01-18T19:10:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aminata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatmata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":1600000,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":160000},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":160000},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":160000},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":160000},{"due_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":160000},{"due_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":160000},{"due_date":"2009-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":160000},{"due_date":"2009-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":160000},{"due_date":"2009-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":160000},{"due_date":"2009-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":160000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2009-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-19T09:07:52Z","rounded_local_amount":208312.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14885087,"comment":null},{"amount":41.25,"local_amount":120000,"processed_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:46:29Z","rounded_local_amount":124987.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27128931,"comment":null},{"amount":55,"local_amount":160000,"processed_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:13:35Z","rounded_local_amount":166650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36025720,"comment":null},{"amount":110,"local_amount":320000,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T23:53:48Z","rounded_local_amount":333300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53008523,"comment":null},{"amount":55,"local_amount":160000,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:25:55Z","rounded_local_amount":166650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63230860,"comment":null},{"amount":110,"local_amount":320000,"processed_date":"2009-09-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:19:43Z","rounded_local_amount":333300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87102866,"comment":null},{"amount":55,"local_amount":160000,"processed_date":"2009-10-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:05:45Z","rounded_local_amount":166650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97019882,"comment":null},{"amount":55,"local_amount":160000,"processed_date":"2009-11-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:35:49Z","rounded_local_amount":166649.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103864727,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-01-18T20:34:25Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T14:35:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":84396,"name":"Lusmila","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Lusmila se dedica a la venta de comida, ella no cuenta con un espacio dentro de su casa para poder abrir un peque\u00f1o restaurante por lo que debe de repartir cliente por cliente el almuerzo de cada uno.\n\nHace tres a\u00f1os que dej\u00f3 su trabajo como servicio dom\u00e9stico para emprender este nuevo negocio.

He's worked on farms since he was a young boy, carefully tending his fields so that they would provide a bounty of the citrus fruits that he cultivates.  He now wants to grow coffee on two and a half \"cuadras\".  When there's not enough work to keep him busy on his own farm, he does farm work for others at 15 soles--about US$5--a day, money that is needed to pay the family's basic expenses.  Apolinario is an active man and he doesn't like to be without work.  He very much wants to get ahead and he's happy because he'll next harvest 80 to 100 \"arrobas\"--a local unit of measure--or roughly 12 kilograms of platanos for sale in the market.  Growing platanos, though, requires a large investment of both time and money.  The plants have to be sprayed every 20 days and the fields have to be fertilized so that the poor soil might produce the kind of fruit required by the market.  Apolinario is among those who never fails to miss a meeting with his credit analyst.  This is his second MFP loan and he always paid on the dates required by his past loan.  He's very grateful for the loans.  He will use this loan to buy fertilizers for his platanos fields.

She now owns her own house where she operates her grocery business.  She had a restaurant years ago where she single-handedly cooked and served food and drinks to her customers.  The business was profitable but the work was very hard and she saw that she would have to give it up when she had twins.  She then switched gears, opening a shop selling groceries where she would have more time to take care of the young twins.  She tends the grocery from 6:00 in the morning to 8:00 at night.  When she has to go to the market, she needs her husband's help or help from a relative because carrying products home with two kids in tow is hard.  She can also leave the twins with her mother so that she can do her shopping and return to mind the store before 10:00 in the morning.  Sonia tries to return before her customers begin cooking because that's when they're most likely to come to her store.  She stays busy afternoons washing clothes for her children.  The business is going well; most importantly, it's profitable.  She says that the business is successful because it's well-tended, well-stocked and the prices she charges are reasonable.

She is from Apurimac and finished high school.  Victoria is married, 52 year old, and has four children age 7, 20, 22 and 25.  All her children are working professionals, with the exception of the youngest who is still in school.  She has her own home, and has always liked children.  When she was young she worked as a nanny, and what she learnt proved useful in opening a wawa wasi, a government-sponsored daycare center, in the neighborhood where she lives.  There are many children, and the parents go off to work and have no one with whom to leave them. Victoria recognized the opportunity and remodeled her home. With the help of her mother-in-law they took in children for ten years; however, they had to close because there were too many children and they were unable to cope.  \r\n\r\nFor the past six years, Victoria has sold fruit from her doorstep, taking advantage of the fact that the house is situated near the last stop on the minibus route, generating a lot of foot traffic.  Now she wants to open a small grocery store in her home. \r\n\r\nVictoria needs a loan of $450 (approximately 1400 Peruvian soles) to open a shop that would operate out of her home.  She needs to buy rice, sugar, and oil, as well as to paint the store prior to the opening.  She has received help from Finca and has been able to move ahead with the talks, has learnt how to sell and how to position her business to fair well with the competition.

This is why Vida has asked for a loan to invest and increase her working capital so that she can continue with her business and survive with her family who are always making efforts to improve their financial situation.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Laure Kwon, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":257124,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Games","sector":"Entertainment","use":"Working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-01-17T18:00:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vida Luz ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":8500,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":772.73},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":772.73},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":772.73},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":772.73},{"due_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":772.73},{"due_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":772.73},{"due_date":"2009-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":772.73},{"due_date":"2009-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":772.73},{"due_date":"2009-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":772.73},{"due_date":"2009-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":772.73},{"due_date":"2009-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":772.7}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40.91},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40.91},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.91},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.91},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.91},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.91},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.91},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.91},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.91},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.91},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.9}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40.91,"local_amount":772.73,"processed_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:41:04Z","rounded_local_amount":816.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20399987,"comment":null},{"amount":40.91,"local_amount":772.73,"processed_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:35:52Z","rounded_local_amount":816.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27091985,"comment":null},{"amount":40.9,"local_amount":772.73,"processed_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:38:18Z","rounded_local_amount":816.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35985369,"comment":null},{"amount":40.91,"local_amount":772.73,"processed_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:09:26Z","rounded_local_amount":816.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44445985,"comment":null},{"amount":40.91,"local_amount":772.73,"processed_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:39:32Z","rounded_local_amount":816.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52956626,"comment":null},{"amount":245.46,"local_amount":4636.35,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T14:00:31Z","rounded_local_amount":4896.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63174053,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-01-17T19:53:05Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T14:00:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":84432,"name":"Claudia Mercedes","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Esta Empresaria de Nombre Claudia Mercedes Q.

V..  She is 39, single, and has a 12-year-old son in his second year of high school.  She aims to keep making money and maintain her customer base as she is a single mother and the only person working in her family.  She has had to work hard to raise her son as her situation does not allow her to work where she would make a higher income.  She wants to expand her business, to stop working as a street vendor and to open a store in her own home.  She dreams of educating her son, that he will have a career to fall back on so that he will be able to take care of himself.  She also wants to stop working for others; she wants to dedicate herself full-time to her business.\r\n\r\nClaudia sells a variety of goods such as cosmetics, purses, shoes, perfumes in the street.  She has been a street vendor for seven years.  She started this business when she found herself alone, abandoned and unable to count on anyone else's help. There was not enough money to care for her son and her household expenses: she had to find a way to survive.  Since then, she has overcome a number of obstacles and she hopes to make progress with the help of this loan, which will be working capital to buy a number of products such as watches, bracelets, earrings, clothing among others for which she will have to travel to Managua, Chinandega and Le\u00f3n to satisfy her customers.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Laure Kwon, Kiva

She is a very hard-working woman who goes out early in the morning to get the fish she needs to sell and in this way supports her family. She has done this work for 14 years during which time she has become an expert in the business. She enjoys it because it is honorable and quiet work, although sometimes is it tiring and the smell of fish is hard to get rid of. But Beatriz is persistent and hopes to grow the business so that she can get ahead and provide a better future for herself and her children. This is her 7th loan with Microfinanzas Prisma; she has been responsible and on time with her payments since she does not want to disappoint the people who have put their trust in her.

Her family has three children who are of school age.  Her family's main income comes from raising cows.  She joined TYM  Fund in 2004.  Her first loan was 500,000 VND to invest in raising chickens.  The profit earned from chicken raising has given her confidence to borrow more loans to invest in raising cattles.  Currently,  her family has three cows, bringing her an income of 10,000,000 VND.  Because of this, her family's economy is gradually improving.  She would like to borrow 12,000,000 VND to buy more cows. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by Thiennga Ngo, Kiva

The loan will be used to purchase the flour and coal for baking the \u201clepeshka.\u201d  \r\n\r\nHomidjon deeply appreciates the trust and support you are giving him. \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road, the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets including Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, and Mavlavi Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nSadly, however, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment, forcing hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve agricultural production and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need. \r\n\r\nTo learn more about IMON International's work, please visit:

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

Mavlidakhon T. is 48 years old. She and her husband have raised three children. For 20 years already, Mavlidakhon has been working in the largest local market in the city. She sells green lentils and peas. These legumes are very popular in Tajikistan. Thery can be cooked in soups or used to make porridge; both are very nourishing, healthy, and tasty. So that the business is very stable and generates a stable income for the family, today Mavlidakhon is requesting 1500 Somoni (450 US Dollars) for a term of 8 months. The loan willl be spent for purchasing green lentils and peas to re-sell. Mavlidakhon thanks all for their support and promises to repay the loan on time.   \r\n<P>\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

With the faith that his children should go to college to get ahead, he started a business processing and selling dried apricots to be able to make enough money to pay for their schooling. This is why he started this business 14 years ago. He is experienced in this kind of business and that allows him to expand his clientele day by day. Right now Mukhtor is requesting 1500 Somoni (450 USD) for a term of 8 months. He is going to spend the loan on purchasing dried apricots for processing and sale.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

My eldest son completed his education until 10th standard and then started his own business. He runs a grocery shop in the community, where people buy groceries. My youngest son reads in 9th standard and my daughter reads in kindergarten. I belong to an embroidery business. I do this work to pay off the school fees of my younger children. \r\n\r\nI\u2019m happy to share the financial burden of our family with my husband and son. I am applying for a loan to buy groceries to increase the profits for my son. \r\n\r\nI am a group leader of some women in my locality. Bilquis baji wants a loan to buy wheat to resell. Allah Rakhi baji wants a loan to buy a donkey cart for her loading business. Naseem Akhtar baji wants a loan to buy seasonal fruits for her fruit selling business. \r\n\r\nThis is a group loan. The loan funds will be distributed among the group members, each of whom will invest in their own business. The members mutually guarantee each other's loans. If one member does not repay, the other members are responsible.\r\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":258309,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"To buy groceries for grocery shop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PK","country":"Pakistan","town":"Borewala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"30.719444 70.997222","type":"point"}},"partner_id":60,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zaib-Un-Nisa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bilquis  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Allah Rakhi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Naseem Akhtar ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PKR","disbursal_amount":55000,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2391.3},{"due_date":"2009-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2391.3},{"due_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2391.3},{"due_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2391.3},{"due_date":"2009-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2391.3},{"due_date":"2009-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":2391.3},{"due_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2391.3},{"due_date":"2009-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2391.3},{"due_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2391.3},{"due_date":"2009-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2391.3},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2391.3},{"due_date":"2009-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2391.3},{"due_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2391.3},{"due_date":"2009-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2391.3},{"due_date":"2009-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2391.3},{"due_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2391.3},{"due_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2391.3},{"due_date":"2009-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2391.3},{"due_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2391.3},{"due_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":2391.3},{"due_date":"2009-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2391.3},{"due_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":2391.3},{"due_date":"2010-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2391.4}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.43},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.43},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.43},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.43},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.43},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.43},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.43},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.43},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.43},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.43},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.43},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.43},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.43},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.43},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.43},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.43},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.43},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.43},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.43},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.43},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.43},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.43},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.54}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":84613,"name":"Hamidan Khan Muhammad Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"My name is Hamidan and I\u2019m a 48 year old widow.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions. But, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She has two daughters, one of whom is 17 years old and has one year of general studies, while her other daughter is 12 years old and has six years of primary education.  The purpose of this credit is to meet the demand that already exists since she depends on the profits of her business to support her home economically.  Her dream is to acquire her own home because she currently lives in the home of her mother and would like her children to gain a better life.  Getting a good education is an important part of her children's progress and for society and the country.\r\n\r\nMs. Johana's economic activity is the roaming sale of cosmetics and clothes.  She has worked in this business for nine years.  Ms. Johana started this business because of the necessity of having an income stream to care for her family and to meet the responsibility of giving her children basic necessities.  She decided to offer clothes and cosmetics because her clients are office workers at local businesses.  She started with just a few products such as shirts, pants and perfumes and in this manner was able to obtain work. She now needs working capital to purchase products from different departments in the country, since she doesn't want to lose clients if she cannot offer them the products they request and her main goal is to obtain a greater variety of merchandise to offer them.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Daniel Kahn, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":258339,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-01-19T15:50:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Johana Patricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":6000,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2009-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2009-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":108.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":108.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":108.33,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:40:32Z","rounded_local_amount":2144.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20399991,"comment":null},{"amount":108.33,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2009-03-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:35:51Z","rounded_local_amount":2144.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27091989,"comment":null},{"amount":108.34,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2009-04-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:38:02Z","rounded_local_amount":2144.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35985373,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-01-19T15:57:10Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T16:38:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":84624,"name":"Kosar M.

They named their group Courage. These entrepreneurs have received several loans from Kiva through SMT. The previous loans have had meaningful impacts in the lives of these people. The last loan they received from Kiva through SMT was for Le 800,000.00 each. Now, they are requesting a loan of Le 1,000,000.00 each to enable them to further strengthen their businesses.<p>\r\n\r\nKadiatu K. (left) is the leader of this group. Kadiatu is 30 years of age. She was born in Makeni, northern Sierra Leone. She is married to a local court chairman. The 2 of them have 2 children. One of their children is in Junior Secondary School II (JSS II) and the other is in class VI. She has been in business for 6 years now. Kadiatu sells firewood, plastics, water, and gara lappers (locally dyed clothes). <p>\r\n\r\nWith this loan of Le 1,000,000.00, Kadiatu will use it to buy one truck load of firewood and 3 \u201cpieces\u201d (a piece is about 30 yards of white cotton used in making the gara lappers). A truck load of firewood costs Le 500,000 in a village called Madit, about 5 miles from Makeni. A piece of \u201cbrillian\u201d (the white cotton is called brillian) costs Le 80,000. She will use some of the remaining sum to buy inks, powder, and soda and pay workers who designed the clothes with different styles.  <p>\r\n\r\nSo far, Kadiatu faces no major challenges in her business. Business is going fine for her, and she enjoys doing it. <p>\r\n\r\nWith the profit she makes, Kadiatu uses part of it to repay her loan, pay her children\u2019s school fees, and do things that make her life happy. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1700,"image":{"id":258368,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fuel\/Firewood","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy a truck load of firewood and 3 pieces of \"brillians\"","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Makeni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.883333 -12.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2009-01-19T18:40:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kadiatu ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Abdul ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatmata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Koloneh","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mohamed ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":5000000,"loan_amount":1700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2009-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2009-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2009-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2009-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":170}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":212.5,"local_amount":625000,"processed_date":"2009-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-19T09:07:55Z","rounded_local_amount":632187.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14885088,"comment":null},{"amount":127.5,"local_amount":375000,"processed_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:46:31Z","rounded_local_amount":379312.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27128932,"comment":null},{"amount":169.99,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:13:37Z","rounded_local_amount":505750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36025721,"comment":null},{"amount":340,"local_amount":1000000,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T23:54:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1011500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53008524,"comment":null},{"amount":170.01,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:26:25Z","rounded_local_amount":505750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63230861,"comment":null},{"amount":340,"local_amount":1000000,"processed_date":"2009-09-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:19:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1011500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87102867,"comment":null},{"amount":170,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2009-10-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:05:49Z","rounded_local_amount":505750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97019883,"comment":null},{"amount":170,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2009-11-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:35:50Z","rounded_local_amount":505750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103864728,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-01-19T20:11:32Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T14:35:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":84633,"name":"Ramzana M.
