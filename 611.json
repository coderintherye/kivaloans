Thus she works alone day by day in her own house, but there are times when she needs to pay for workhands to help her in her production: her embroidery workshop is renowned and considered prestigious in her area, something that favors her by granting her recurring customers. She thinks her job is profitable because her customers are willing to pay what she asks, considering it to be fair seeing the quality and finish she offers. On top of this she also engages in agriculture, and every 6 months she returns to her lands to harvest. She says she will always engage in her job, and for this reason she has put her mind to increasing the knitting production, as she has more embroidery requests and wants to satisfy them on time. This is her thirds loan with MFP through the group loans of her communal bank. She likes meeting up with her group and share experiences, and for this reason she believes her team to be sound and to be working in unity. Showing the same determination, she has decided she will invest the loan in the purchase of more materials for her embroidery, such as fabric and threads in different colors.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":789050,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","use":"To buy fabric and threads in different colors.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-06-14T22:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Albina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:50:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1038.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250835434,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-06-15T05:08:17Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T10:50:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":306144,"name":"Servio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Servio se dedica a una pulper\u00eda ubicada en su casa de habitaci\u00f3n.

is a 39-year-old taxi driver from village Kobuleti, Adjara Region, Black Sea coast. He is unmarried and lives with his parents--his 56-year-old mother and 70-year-old father, in the village. \r\n\r\nTengiz\u2019s family is actively involved in agricultural activities. In particular, they have two milk cows, whose milk is used for cheese production. Cheese is sold on the local market. Also they have a citrus garden with an area of 3,000 sq. meters. The harvested citrus is sold to wholesalers. Along with the above-mentioned, Tengiz and his parents run a small bee-keeping farm. They have seven bee-hives with bee-colonies. Honey is gathered twice a year and sold on the local market. \r\n\r\nAlong with agriculture, Tengiz\u2019s taxi is an important source of the income for the family. Tengiz mainly works in Batumi and Kobuleti, nearby towns and a tourism centre of Georgia. His car is very old and already not comfortable, so Tengiz decided to sell it, add the borrowed amount to its price, and buy a new, better car. He should do it before July, as in July the tourism season starts and he should be ready to serve the tourists. \r\n\r\nTengiz hopes that he will have more clients for this season as he will have a better, more comfortable car. This will be positively reflected in family income. Tengiz plans to use one part of the profit gained this season for purchasing additional bee-hives and bee-colonies. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":655.61,"image":{"id":789458,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","use":"to purchase a new car (taxi).","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Kobuleti","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2011-06-11T16:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tengiz","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":1700,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":125.58},{"due_date":"2011-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":120.69},{"due_date":"2011-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":124.66},{"due_date":"2011-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":130.19},{"due_date":"2011-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":133.06},{"due_date":"2011-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":138.58},{"due_date":"2012-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":142.01},{"due_date":"2012-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":146.69},{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":152.89},{"due_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":156.57},{"due_date":"2012-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":162.08},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":167}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.56},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.55},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.99},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.42},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.18},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.59},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.72},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.6},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.43},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.7},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.11},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":77.56,"local_amount":125.58,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:09:06Z","rounded_local_amount":128.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221711555,"comment":null},{"amount":74.55,"local_amount":120.69,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T09:49:22Z","rounded_local_amount":123.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227082002,"comment":null},{"amount":76.99,"local_amount":124.66,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:40:49Z","rounded_local_amount":127.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232843737,"comment":null},{"amount":80.42,"local_amount":130.19,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-16T09:23:12Z","rounded_local_amount":133.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238658596,"comment":null},{"amount":82.18,"local_amount":133.06,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:35:37Z","rounded_local_amount":136.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244612652,"comment":null},{"amount":85.59,"local_amount":138.58,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:43:05Z","rounded_local_amount":141.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250827908,"comment":null},{"amount":87.72,"local_amount":142.01,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:09:11Z","rounded_local_amount":145.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257238102,"comment":null},{"amount":90.6,"local_amount":146.69,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:21:35Z","rounded_local_amount":150.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263377536,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-06-15T20:29:32Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":306239,"name":"Costancio","description":{"languages":["pt","en"],"texts":{"pt":"Natural do Distrito da Catembe  Provincia da Maputo.

She is 31 years old, married, and the mother of three children between 8 and 14 years of age. All of her children attend school. She went to school through the fifth grade, but had to stop going when her mother abandoned her and left her in the care of her grandmother. She lives in her own home with her family, and also supports her grandmother, who lives with them.\r\nShe left Namaacha for the city of Matola during the war. Years later, she returned to her homeland. She started working when she was very young because her grandmother didn't have the economic means to support her. She owns a shop where she sells staple goods (rice, sugar, soap, perishables, etc.). She has no employees, but two of her children help her in the shop. She works from 6 a.m. till 11 p.m. and brings in about 6000 meticals a month, which she uses for household expenses and for construction on the house. She is able to save about 1500 meticals a month in her bank account because her husband, who is a teacher, also contributes to the household financially.\r\nThis is her fourth loan with Hluvuku and her third with Kiva. She will use this 20,000-metical loan to buy staple goods for her shop. Her previous loans (in the amounts of 7000, 10,000, and 15,000 meticals) also were invested in the business.\r\nShe is confident that she will be able to repay the loan without difficulty and request an additional loan to finish the construction."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":505.33,"image":{"id":789488,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase staple goods for her shop.

She resides in the town of Nookat, known for its agricultural products of a high quality and taste. It\u2019s been ten years since she got involved in agriculture, following the example of most of her friends. Land feeds all residents of this town, therefore every resident is thankful for being born in a land with such rich soil and good climate. Shakar is a widow, however she has given a worthy life to all of her three kids, two of whom already have their own businesses. For ten years Shakar has been saving and gradually expanding the size of the land she owns. At this moment her piece of land is one of the largest in the neighborhood. This means that she cultivates a bigger amount of agricultural products and she needs more inputs such as water and fertilizers.  The initial capital of 1500 soms used ten years ago allowed Shakar to grow only one type of product, unlike now when Shakar grows a wide variety of products. However Shakar isn\u2019t always capable of covering  all her costs, especially fertilizers. For such big land and wide range of products, Shakar needs a large amount of different types of fertilizers. With this purpose she is applying  for a loan from Kiva.\r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

He is 31 years old, married, and the father of four children between the ages of 6 months and 12 years. Three of the children attend school. He finished high school, where he trained as a teacher, and he would like to pursue higher education. He lives in his own home with his family, and also supports his three nephews, who live with them.\r\nHe and his parents left Inhambane for the district of Namaacha, where he grew up and received his professional training. He has a permanent position as a teacher and works from 6:45 a.m. till 1:50 p.m. He earns 9055 meticals a month, which he uses for household expenses and for construction on the home. He is able to save 1000 meticals a month because his wife, who is also a teacher, also contributes to the household.\r\nNitron has also taken out loans with BIM. He learned about Hluvuku through coworkers who are also clients of the organization.

She is 37 years old, married, and the mother of three children between 4 and 10 years of age. All of her children attend school. She went to school through the seventh grade but had to drop out because of her family's financial circumstances. She lives in her own home with her family, and is not responsible for anyone else besides her children.\r\nShe and her husband moved from Inhambane to the district of Namaacha, where she started working in a tailor's workshop and learned to sew. Her husband emigrated to South Africa and bought her a sewing machine, so she began taking in sewing jobs at home. She has counter in her home where she also sells staple goods (sugar, peanuts, rice, beans, pasta, etc.). She spends an average of about 8000 meticals on each shopping trip and earns a profit of 3000 meticals, which she uses to cover household expenses and construction on the house. She also gets help from her husband, who works in South Africa.\r\nShe has held loans from other banks. She learned about Hluvuku through friends who are also clients of the organization. This is her fourth loan, and she will use the 17,000 meticals to increase the stock of products she carries for her shop. Her previous loans (in the amounts of 3000, 8000, and 15,000 meticals) were also invested in the business.\r\nShe is confident that she will have no trouble paying off this loan and will be able to request others in the future that will help her start building a house on a new

is an active 49-year-old mother. Her husband works in Russia. Sodisa has five children and loves all of them. She is engaged in a farming business and cultivates wheat, rice and corn. Her son and daughter always help her to improve their living conditions. The income she earns from this business allows her to take care of her family of five children. She has a good credit history. Sodisa needs to buy seeds, fertilizer, fuel and lubricants. Sodisa is requesting a loan of $1,100 USD to help her with this purchase.\r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Her husband and older son help her in this business. The reason why Bazargul is requesting a loan from IMON International is to invest in seeds, mineral fertilizers, fuel and lubricants. This will be her 5th loan and she has a good credit history. With this loan she will be able to succeed and have better opportunities for the sale of her products after the harvest.  \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

who was born in 1955, is a widow with eleven children, one of whom is younger than 15. She lives in a four room house with her children. Emerencia joined GHAPE in 2009 and received a loan of 50,000 XAF, which was successfully repaid. The only problem that Emerencia faces in life is that she has to singlehandedly take care of her children since her husband died. She hates thinking of the deaths of her father, husband and son. She struggles to see that she takes care of the children her husband left behind, paying tuition fees, feeding them and catering to their health.\r\n\r\nEmerencia is requesting a loan to purchase Irish potatoes. She plans to buy five bags of potatoes at 23,000 XAF each and she will use 20,000 XAF from her savings to pay for the transportation of her goods to the Belo weekly market. She believes her business will succeed because there is a ready market and her prices are moderate, which would encourage customers. Any profits made would be used to pay tuition fees for her children. Emerencia prefers a loan from GHAPE because a lower interest is charged and repayment is gradual.\r\n\r\nAbout GHAPE \r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.

GHAPE instils a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":206.25,"image":{"id":789647,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

who was born in 1968, is married and has six children. She lives in a two room house in Elimighong, in the Belo subdivision. She joined GHAPE in 2009 and was given a loan of 50,000 XAF, which she repaid successfully. Life has not been easy for Esilia in the past as she was unble to provide for her family, especially when her husband had an accident. GHAPE has therefore revived her from this bondage. With the profits earned from her first loan, she has paid her children's school fees.\r\n\r\nEsilia is now requesting a second loan which she plans to use to buy ingredients for puff puff (doughnuts), Irish potatoes and kerosene. The population of her area provides a ready market and she is experienced in the field. With any profits earned from this loan, Esilia intends to pay fees and purchase a pot. She prefers a loan from GHAPE because repayment is gradual and a lower interest rate is charged.        \r\n\r\nAbout GHAPE \r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instils a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":187.5,"image":{"id":789649,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to

born in 1956, is married to Mr Rumanus and they are blessed with two children. They live in a two-room house in the Elemighong Quarter of Belo Subdivision, Northwest Region of Cameroon. Since her husband fell ill, life has not been the same; Mercy finds it difficult to care for her children with no one to assist her. Her husband can\u2019t do anything because of his illness. \r\n\r\nMercy became a GHAPE member in 2009, and a loan of 50,000 XAF was lent to her. She proved to be very serious due to the fact that she repaid her first loan without any problems.\r\n\r\nMercy now requests her second loan to continue with her buy-and-sell trade. She plans to buy Irish potatoes for 37,000 XAF, rice for 21,000 XAF, garri for 11,000 XAF and a goat for 21,000 XAF. She plans to fatten and resell the goat. A ready market would enhance a smooth running of her business. The profit she would get would be used to pay tuition fees for her children, enlarge her house and provide food and medication for the family.    \r\n\r\nAbout GHAPE \r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.

clients.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":789667,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to

They all live in a three-room house in the Anyajua Quarter in Belo Subdivision. \r\n\r\nRoseline faced the problem of inadequate business capital and borrowing from other financial institution was very expensive for her because she needed to provide collateral, something she could not provide. She got enrolled into GHAPE in 2009, and took her first loan of 50,000 XAF, which she has successfully repaid. \r\n \r\nRoseline is now requesting her second loan from GHAPE. She needs this second loan because she wants to expand in her buy-and-sell trade. She plans to buy three bags of Irish potatoes at 23,000 XAF per bag, two tins of palm oil at 13,000 XAF each and two bags of flour at 10,000 XAF per bag. She believes that the business will be a success since she is always punctual, as well as being very good to her customers. She is helping the community by employing people to transport her goods to the market. She will use the proceeds from the loan to care for her family.\r\n\r\nAbout GHAPE \r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.

was born in 1961 and is a widow. Her husband died, leaving her with five children of whom she takes care. She and her children live in a two-room house in the Elemighong Quarter in Belo Subdivision of Cameroon. The death of her husband has been a major setback to her and her children because it became very difficult for her to singlehandedly take care of them. \r\n\r\nShe thought of doing business that could raise money to care for her children. There was a big problem because she could not raise the business capital. The introduction of GHAPE in her community became a solution to her problem. She became a GHAPE member in 2010. She took her first loan of 50,000 XAF and started buying and selling Irish potatoes. She was very successful because she was able repay the loan without any problems and could also pay tuition fees for her children. \r\n\r\nShe is now requesting her second loan to continue in the same business. She plans to buy five bags of Irish potatoes at 23,000 XAF each. She will use 10,000 XAF from her past savings to pay for the transportation of her goods to the weekly Belo market. She knows her business will succeed because she has so many customers. She says her community will benefit from her trade because they will be able to have Irish potatoes from her stock at very cheap prices.\r\n\r\nAbout GHAPE \r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.

They live in a a two-room apartment in the Elemighong quarter in Belo Sub Division of Cameroon. The quest for business capital and friends encouraged her to join GHAPE. She became a GHAPE member in 2009. In early 2010 she took her first loan of 50,000 F CFA from GHAPE. She used this loan in her little business, and this helped her a lot because she was able to buy a pot from the proceeds she got from the loan. She was also able to repay this loan without any problem.\n\nShe is now requesting her second loan. She plans to continue with her same line of business. She plans to buy dried fish for 65,000 F CFA, gari for 30,000 F CFA, and 20,000 F CFA will be used for the purchase of a goat for fattening and resale. She knows this business will succeed because she has been doing this trade for a very long period and she also has many customers who will buy from her. This will help her community in that they will be able to have goods at their doorstep. She decided to obtain a loan from GHAPE because their interest rates are very low and the way of repaying the loan is bit by bit, thus very easy. She also says she will use the proceeds to buy more kitchen utensils and also pay tuition fees for her children. \n\nAbout GHAPE \n\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instils a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":789704,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy fish, gari (manioc grits) and a goat to raise for sale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Elemighong Belo Sub Division","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"6 12","type":"point"}},"partner_id":40,"posted_date":"2011-06-21T10:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Grace ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XAF","disbursal_amount":115000,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":4791.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":4791.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":4791.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":4791.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":4791.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4791.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4791.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":4791.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":4791.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":4791.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":4791.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":4791.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":4791.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":4791.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":4791.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":4791.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":4791.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":4791.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4791.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4791.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":4791.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":4791.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":4791.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":4791.59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.45},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.45},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.45},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.45},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":11.46,"local_amount":4791.67,"processed_date":"2011-06-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:13:51Z","rounded_local_amount":5172.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216514635,"comment":null},{"amount":11.46,"local_amount":4791.67,"processed_date":"2011-07-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:54:28Z","rounded_local_amount":5172.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221680133,"comment":null},{"amount":11.46,"local_amount":4791.67,"processed_date":"2011-07-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:54:42Z","rounded_local_amount":5172.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221680134,"comment":null},{"amount":240.62,"local_amount":100624.99,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T09:20:22Z","rounded_local_amount":108631.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227049333,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-06-21T12:24:26Z","paid_date":"2011-09-15T09:20:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":306347,"name":"Carlos","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Carlos tiene 36 a\u00f1os de edad, vive junto a su novia y sus dos menores hijos en la comunidad rural de M\u00f3rrope  en Lambayeque.

The family lives in a six-room apartment at the Elemighong quarter in the Belo Subdivision of Cameroon. Foctina's greatest problems were that she did not attain a primary school education and that she needed business capital to take care of her children. The search for business capital was addressed by the encouragement to join the GHAPE program by  women who were already GHAPE members in her community. A  member since 2009, Forctina took her first loan of 50,000FCFA to buy Irish potatoes to sell. She says sales were very lucrative, enabling her  to repay the loan with no problem and also pay her children's tuition fees.<p>\r\n\r\nForctina is now requesting her second loan from GHAPE to buy five bags of potatoes for 23,000FCFA per bag; she will use 10,000FCFA from her savings  to pay for the transportation of her products to the Belo weekly market. She is confident of business success due to her many customers who are grateful to have the potatoes at their doorsteps for very reasonable prices.

 was born in 1966; she is married to Mr.Vincent  and is blessed with five children. She shares three rooms with her five children in Elemighong, a quarter in Belo Sub Division, North West Region of Cameroon.\n\nHappiness has faced difficulties in her life ranging from inability to meet her daily needs, the inability of her husband to get a job for himself nor carry out any activity that could raise income due to accident, the inability of her first son to continue his education due to poverty and the increasing demands from her children. Amongst other challenges, she also has had difficulties with inadequate capital to expand her business. \n\nWith this loan, she plans to buy more foodstuffs like Irish potatoes and castle  oil (a locally made oil used for the treatment of some skin diseases and also used as food)  for sale. She thinks her business will succeed because her business site is close to the road and she is friendly thus has many customers. Her activity will help her community in reducing cost of transportation to buy foodstuffs at the market and their cordial relationship will give room for negotiation to pay later.\n\nShe will use a fraction of her profit to assist her husband, provide for the children\u2019s school needs, meeting her personal needs and those of her family. She prefers a loan from GHAPE because of the training she frequently receives, the follow-up and moral support given her by the GHAPE office and the low cost in obtaining and paying back a loan.\n\nAbout GHAPE \n\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.

They live in a 2-room apartment in the Tumuku quarter of the Belo subdivision in Cameroon. In 2009, hardship and tough times led Regina to become a member of GHAPE. She got her first loan of 50,000 XAF and embarked on the buying and selling of goats, earning enough to move on with life.\r\n\r\nRegina is requesting her second loan in order to buy goats for 60,000 XAF, beans for 20,000 XAF and to pay workers on her farm 20,000 XAF. She knows she is going to succeed because she has been keeping goats for a long time and had been farming long before she got to GHAPE. Her trade is actually helping the community since she offers door-to-door service. Regina has faced challenges in life when her daughter had an accident and was hospitalized and when one of her son's hands was cut off. The profit from Regina's loan will be used to take care of her and her children's health and to invest in her agriculture. Regina prefers GHAPE because she can repay in bits.\r\n  \r\nAbout GHAPE \r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.

who was born in 1956, is married to Eunice Nage and they are blessed with six children, one of whom is younger than 15. They live in a two-room apartment in the Tumuku Belo subdivision. Jacob had a lot of difficulty in providing for his six children, so in 2010 he was introduced to GHAPE by his friend, who was a member. He had his first loan of 50,000 XAF, which he used to purchase goats and to farm. \r\n\r\n<p>Jacob is requesting a second loan to buy seven goats for 75,000 XAF, beans for 22,500 XAF and corn for 32,500 XAF. He knows that he will succeed since he has enough land to graze his goats and to farm. Jacob is satisfying the high demand for goats in his community and thus helping the community. He was challenged when his son failed his certificate exam. Jacob will use the profit from this loan to pay his children's tuition fees and to repay his loan. Jacob took a loan from GHAPE because the interest rates are low and repayment is bit by bit.\r\n\r\nAbout GHAPE \r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.

Thanks to the time she spends on her crops, she is able to have a good harvest during each farming season.  What she likes most about her work are the hours she spends clearing the fields and getting rid of the weeds that grow around her plants.  She has spent 15 years devoting herself to the noble business of farming.  During this time she has acquired much knowledge, and she happy about that.\r\n\r\nHer main crops are coffee and bananas.  She sells them in her own area.  After each harvest she boxes them (a way of canning her fruits).  She then sells them to the wholesale merchants who arrive on Tuesdays and Thursdays.  She is very satisfied with the results that she is getting.\r\n\r\nHer primary desire is to grow more agricultural products that are native to the area.  She has already taken the first step by planting avocadoes and citrus fruits.  The result of this is a good crop that is growing without any significant difficulty.  They will produce their first fruits soon.\r\n\r\nThat is why she is asking for the support from each one of you so that she can step up this business activity.\r\n\r\nShe belongs to the \u201cLuz del Futuro\u201d (Light of the Future) Communal Bank.

She pledges, once again, to make her payments as she has done with the previous loans she has had.  It pleases her to be part of her communal bank because all of the members are responsible and very supportive people.\r\n\r\nUpon receiving your support, Felicita will use the requested money to buy various sacks of organic fertilizer to spread among her coffee, banana, and avocado crops. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":789763,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy various sacks of organic fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-06-13T18:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Felicita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":147.09},{"due_date":"2011-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":154.44},{"due_date":"2011-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":162.16},{"due_date":"2011-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":170.27},{"due_date":"2011-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":178.79},{"due_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":187.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.16},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.91},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.81},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.86},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.04},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.22}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":55.16,"local_amount":147.09,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:32:12Z","rounded_local_amount":152.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216550458,"comment":null},{"amount":57.91,"local_amount":154.44,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:12:49Z","rounded_local_amount":159.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221719138,"comment":null},{"amount":60.81,"local_amount":162.16,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:14:13Z","rounded_local_amount":167.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350602,"comment":null},{"amount":63.86,"local_amount":170.27,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:48:30Z","rounded_local_amount":176.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232851042,"comment":null},{"amount":67.04,"local_amount":178.79,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:56:56Z","rounded_local_amount":185.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238666202,"comment":null},{"amount":70.22,"local_amount":187.25,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:21Z","rounded_local_amount":193.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621337,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-06-14T03:24:57Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":306367,"name":"Bernice","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Bernice, who was born in 1965, is married to Mr. Muh Francis and is blessed with five children.

is a widow born in 1972.  She was married to Mr. Ndifon Augustin and is blessed with five children, two of them are under fifteen years old. They live in a three room apartment in Tumuku quarter in the Belo subdivision. Evelyn received her first loan of 50,000 FCFA from GHAPE in 2009. She embarked on a retail store business in her area.\r\n\r\nEvelyn is applying for her second loan to increase stock in her store. This loan will be used to buy 20 liters of honey for 30,000 FCFA, 100kg of rice for 30,000 FCFA, a cartoon of soap for 15,000 FCFA, and 125kg of groundnut for 35,000 FCFA. She knows that her trade will be a success because her store is the only one in the quarter and she always meets the demands of the people. Her trade actually helps the community since the demands of the people are satisfied. \r\n\r\nEvelyn had problems in life when the husband died and she was unable to pay her children's school fees. She will use the gain from her loan to buy a plot of land for her children and educate them. She preferred a loan from GHAPE because repayment is in small installments and it offers some training on how loans are to be used.\r\n\r\nAbout GHAPE \r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.

They have 3 children, but live only with one of them: Lisbet, 4, who they are educating and raising in their own home in the town of Puente Paucartambo (in the central Peruvian jungle.)  Two years ago Norma lost her house to a flood (resulting from an overflow of water and mud from an adjacent river.)  Thanks to the humanitarian work of members of her communal bank, she was able to get through this.  She has a business selling soft drinks and beer in a small store that she set up in her house.  According to Norma, the days when her earnings are highest are Saturdays and Sundays.  But this is not Norma's only business.  Since she is a good cook, the teachers at the only school in her town hired her to prepare food for them on a daily basis, because most of them live in rented homes in another town.  Also, when Norma has free time she works with her husband on the farm, planting and harvesting coffee at one point in the year, to later sell to the wholesalers in the city of La Merced.  \r\n\r\nNorma's businesses and other activities are going very well, so in the future she is planning to convert her business selling drinks into a restaurant where she could sell the food that she knows how to prepare.  Norma belongs to the communal bank \"Luz del Futuro\" and this is her 9th loan with MFP; she expects that this small loan from you will help her to achieve these goals.  She promises again to make her payments as scheduled, as she did with her previous loans.  In addition, she is grateful to be a part of her communal bank because all of the members are responsible and cooperative people.  Norma will invest the proceeds of this loan in the purchase of candy and beer to stock her food store, and she will also be buying tables and chairs for her meal service business.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":789770,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Liquor Store \/ Off-License","sector":"Food","use":"to buy sweets and beer for her store, and also to buy tables and chairs for her catering business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-06-13T16:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Norma ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":147.09},{"due_date":"2011-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":154.44},{"due_date":"2011-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":162.16},{"due_date":"2011-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":170.27},{"due_date":"2011-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":178.79},{"due_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":187.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.16},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.91},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.81},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.86},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.04},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.22}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":55.16,"local_amount":147.09,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:32:30Z","rounded_local_amount":152.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216550459,"comment":null},{"amount":57.91,"local_amount":154.44,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:13:05Z","rounded_local_amount":159.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221719139,"comment":null},{"amount":60.81,"local_amount":162.16,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:14:34Z","rounded_local_amount":167.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350603,"comment":null},{"amount":63.86,"local_amount":170.27,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:48:49Z","rounded_local_amount":176.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232851043,"comment":null},{"amount":67.04,"local_amount":178.79,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:57:16Z","rounded_local_amount":185.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238666203,"comment":null},{"amount":70.22,"local_amount":187.25,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:40Z","rounded_local_amount":193.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621338,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-06-16T01:57:42Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":306371,"name":"Celestine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Celestine was born in 1991 and is married to Mr. Gilbert Yem.

They all live together as a family in the house of Margarita's mother, located in the town of Puente Paucartambo (in the central Peruvian jungle.) Margarita is involved in several activities.  For 10 years she has worked at a crate business (a place where they make wooden crates used to pack fruit), and over this time she was able to save enough money to open a restaurant where she sells beef kebabs, hamburgers and salchipapas (a dish of sausage and fried potatoes.)  This business has been well received by the public.  As a young enterprising woman she had a good idea, and now sells not only beef kebabs but also fried chicken.  But she still has an incredible desire to get ahead, because two years ago she also started a business in agriculture cultivating bananas and coffee.  Now she wants to buy more farmland and hopes very soon to conclude a sales agreement, but she will also continue to tend to her restaurant business.  To do this, she is thinking about buying her own house where she could set up a more appealing locale for her restaurant.  Her main worry at this moment is to extract the biggest possible harvest from her coffee crops, since in this season there is a high demand for this product in the marketplace, and this is the time when her crops are maturing.  Margarita belongs to the communal bank \"Luz del Futuro,\" and this is the group's 5th loan cycle with MFP, from which Margarita is pleased to know that she will receive financial support.  She is once-again committed to making her payments on time, as she did with her previous loans.  Also, she appreciates being part of her communal bank because all of the members are cooperative and responsible people.  Margarita will use the proceeds of this loan to purchase 2 hectares of agricultural land where she plans to plant a larger quantity of coffee.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":789796,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy 2 hectares of land where she will cultivate coffee","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-06-14T20:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Margarita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":294.1},{"due_date":"2011-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":308.82},{"due_date":"2011-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":324.25},{"due_date":"2011-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":340.47},{"due_date":"2011-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":357.49},{"due_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":374.87}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.61},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.95},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.54},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.42},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":129.59},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":135.89}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":106.61,"local_amount":294.1,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:33:11Z","rounded_local_amount":294.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216550461,"comment":null},{"amount":111.95,"local_amount":308.82,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:13:41Z","rounded_local_amount":309.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221719141,"comment":null},{"amount":117.54,"local_amount":324.25,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:07Z","rounded_local_amount":324.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350605,"comment":null},{"amount":123.42,"local_amount":340.47,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:47:26Z","rounded_local_amount":340.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232851045,"comment":null},{"amount":129.59,"local_amount":357.49,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:57:53Z","rounded_local_amount":357.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238666205,"comment":null},{"amount":135.89,"local_amount":374.87,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:42:20Z","rounded_local_amount":375.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621340,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-06-15T19:23:37Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T10:42:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":306388,"name":"Antonia Del Carmen","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Antonia , es una peque\u00f1a agricultora de la zona de Ticuantepe, durante 18 a\u00f1os que se dedica al cultivo de pi\u00f1a, la mayor afectaci\u00f3n son las plagas y enfermedades que se le presentan ya que carecen de fertilizaci\u00f3n, los planes hacia su familia es mejor las condiciones de vida; ella  tuvo tres hijos de los cuales uno estudia en la universidad a pesar de los grades problemas econ\u00f3micos, lucha d\u00eda a d\u00eda para ver a su hijo graduado,  do\u00f1a Antonia agradece el apoyo que le brinda Afodenic atr\u00e1vez de fondos Kiva ya que para ella han sido de gran ayuda y poco a poco a realizado cambios en su vida .

Agriculture, her husband\u2019s business, provides the necessary for survival \u201cfood and shelter\u201d.  But, with an entrepreneurial air, Marcela told us that 7 years ago she opened a small food store, where she sells basic goods.  From the early hours of the morning, the inhabitants of her town visit the store, since they know the level of stock she maintains. In her free time, she sews. Everyone knows her and they are constantly seeking her out to offer her work. In addition, she says that in the harvest season she buys and sells coffee \u2013 buying tins of dried coffee from agricultural producers for .80 New Peruvian Soles and reselling them at a profit to a recognized company for .88 New Peruvian Soles. \u201cI have to take advantage of the harvest,\u201d she affirms.  The customers she has gained caused her to increase her sales, which is why in the future she wants to buy herself an industrial machine with which she is sure she will be able to sew easier and faster.  She belongs to the communal bank \u201cLuz del Future\u201d \u201c(Light of the Future) and this is her sixth loan with MFP, where she is waiting for a small loan so that she can reach her goals.

She is a cheerful and responsible woman and a single mother of 2 beautiful children:  Jeyson,  8 and Jeniffer,   3 months old. They live in their own house located in the Peruvian jungle (a native community called Centro Pumpuriani). For 2 years she has planted different products, such as plantains, yucca, and hybrid corn. This brings her earnings at different times of the year. For example, she harvests the corn 6 months after planting, the yucca after the corn, and the plantains every two weeks. This helps her invest more. When her crops are ready, she sells them to buyers who come on weekends to the native community. What Lida likes the most is being able to plant different varieties of products, in addition to spending her free time planting and clearing on other land, where they pay her extra money according to how long she works there. Now she plans to plant citrus, since these crops are grown for 8 years before they begin producing- enough time to be able to generate more income in the future. Meanwhile, she is taking advantage of the coffee harvest these months, when she for sure will be able to make some income.

She is a cheerful and strong woman who is married to 52 year-old Nicanor.  The couple have six children though they only live with two of them: 18 year-old Madai and 7 year-old Vian.  The family lives in a rental house which is located in the central jungle (Yurinaki).  Elva has been farming since she was a young girl.  \"The land is my life\" she admits.  When she was a girl she would help to prepare the land for sowing but as a young girl she saved up enough money and, when she was 19, she bought her own plot of farm land.  Since that time, she has been growing coffee, bananas and corn.\r\n\r\nElva has a small house in the indigenous community of Centro Pumpuriani.  She travels there every weekend to care for her farm land.  When her crops are ripe, she sells them in the central market in Yurinaki.  She tells us that in the past she didn't have enough capital to hire laborers to help her harvest her ripe coffee beans and so she did the work together with her husband. \"The two of us worked hard to harvest our coffee on time\", she says.  Now that she is working with her community bank, she is able to invest capital in hiring laborers and, in this way, she can make profits in less time.\r\n\r\nIn the coming months, Elva will put together the capital she needs to buy a car.  In this way she will be able to travel to her farm land all the time.  Elva belongs to the \"Abejitas D. Pumpuriani\" (Little Bees of Pumpuriani) community bank and this is her fifth loan from MFP.  She hopes to obtain the financial support she needs to achieve her goals.  On her part, she pledges once again to make her repayments on time as she has with her previous loans.\r\n\r\nElva enjoys being a member of her community bank because all the members are responsible people and very supportive of each other.

Her current situation is slightly unstable, as a few months ago her banana plants caught fire and she lost the whole crop, but she does not let this discourage her. On the contrary, she is looking at other ways of getting ahead, and she has already sown young banana plants which she hopes will give good fruits. At the moment her priority is to save up enough capital to build her house in a more resistant material, which will help her provide her children with a better quality of life. \r\n\r\nShe is a member of the \"Abejitas de Pumpuriani\" (\"Pumpuriani's Little Bees\") communal bank and this is her fifth loan with MFP.

She also enjoys being part of a community bank because all other members are responsible and very supportive individuals. If she gets your support, Bertha will invest the money in the purchase of several bags of organic compost to distribute it amongst her crops of bananas, cassava and corn, which she will harvest very soon.

Over the course of his career, Jorge has worked as a probation officer and a guidance counselor in multiple capacities at the collegiate level. He also has two masters degrees, one in Education and Counseling and the other in Administration and Leadership. \r\n\r\nJorge is licensed to counsel people of all ages, but most of his clients are children. The majority of his clients are referred to him by schools, pediatricians, and the Juvenile Department Correctional Center. Because most of Jorge's clients are in school during the day, he meets with them in the evenings and on the weekends to keep them from missing class. Jorge typically meets with his adult clients in the afternoon before school gets out. \r\n\r\nJorge says that success with any client begins with building trust. He makes a point to build rapport with clients before addressing serious issues. Jorge emphasizes that he doesn't change anyone--they change themselves. He then finds ways to improve their situations, but he says that the decision to change always rests with them. \r\n\r\nJorge is using this loan to better advertise his business and to maintain operating capital. Until now, Jorge has spent very little money on advertising, instead relying upon referrals to generate business. He already has business cards and fliers, but will use this loan to take out a billboard advertisement. Whatever money remains will be used as cash to meet miscellaneous business expenses. Because most of Jorge's revenues come from claims paid by insurance companies, there is often little certainty of when he will actually be paid.

He formed his family there with Orfelia, his wife of two years.  They have a daughter, Mar\u00eda, who they care for with much love and affection since she\u2019s still a little girl.\r\n\r\nLuis\u2019s life has been the fields, an activity that is necessary to live.  Since he was a little boy his parents always taught him how to work the land, to make it productive and to live off it.  Because of this he decided to continue the family activity and now he has his own fields planted with coffee and bananas.  He has two hectares of farmland.  When the harvests are collected he sells them in the market in the city of La Merced.  What he most enjoys about his work is planting because he knows that profits depend on the good care he provides his plants.  He\u2019s been in this line of work for 10 years and considers the brusque weather changes that affect crop yields quite a bit to be the most difficult part of it.\r\n\r\nIn the future he\u2019d like to continue to work hard improving his crops because he knows that he will reach his objectives since he works tirelessly.  On his spare time he helps out other farmers who pay him a bit of extra money.\r\n\r\nHe belongs to the \u201cAroma de Caf\u00e9\u201d (Aroma of Coffee) communal bank and this is the fourth loan with MFP where he hopes to receive financial support to reach his goals.  On the other hand, he commits once again to pay his installments like he did with the previous loans he got.  Also, he enjoys being part of his communal bank because all the members are responsible and very mutually supportive people.\r\n\r\nIf Luis were to get the requested loan he will invest the money in the purchase of several sacks of organic manure to spread among his coffee and banana crops which haven\u2019t ripened yet.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":789944,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy several sacks of organic manure.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-06-14T15:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luis ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":725,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:42:55Z","rounded_local_amount":2001.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621342,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-06-15T15:34:04Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T10:42:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":306431,"name":"Jose","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jose owns S. Construction, Inc., a commercial sub-contracting firm specializing in concrete installation.  When Jose started this business three years ago, he was his firm\u2019s only employee.  Now, Jose has 16 full-time employees and the capacity to manage multiple projects simultaneously.  Jose began working in construction 17 years ago as a general laborer.  From there, he worked his way up through the construction industry, gaining experience in cost estimating and project management along the way.  \r\n\r\nJose has a degree in civil engineering from the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP), which he earned while working full-time to support his family.  In the eight years that Jose was a student, he took a variety of odd jobs both within and outside of the construction industry.  Instead of going through the motions as he pursued his goal of becoming a civil engineer, Jose took every job as a learning opportunity and a chance for self-improvement.  For example, Jose credits working at Wal-Mart with building the customer service skills he uses daily as a small business owner.  \r\n\r\nRecently, UTEP began offering graduate studies in construction management.  Jose wants to return to school part-time so that he can learn more about the financial side of project management.  He says that his educational and work experience to this point prepared him to design and implement projects, but that management and finance courses will make him a better business owner.\r\n\r\nJose is using this loan as operating capital for his business.  The construction industry in El Paso was really slow during the first few months of 2011.  In order to support himself and his employees, Jose says he rolled the dice in taking projects with several general contractors he otherwise wouldn\u2019t.  The decision backfired when they didn\u2019t pay on time, and Jose\u2019s cash flow diminished to the point that it threatened his ability to pay upcoming bills.  As someone who stakes his reputation on punctuality, Jose decided to take out a small loan for operating capital until business picked up.  In addition to supplying Jose\u2019s business with needed cash, it allows Jose to build his business\u2019 credit.\r\n\r\nWithin the next two to three years, Jose wants to become a general contractor.  To do so, he says the business will need to expand its services and add expertise, which will take time.  In the meantime, Jose believes that there is enough demand for concrete installation that his business can continue expanding its presence as a subcontractor.  \r\n\r\nS. Construction, Inc. is a family owned and operated business.   Jose employs his dad, who has 37 years of experience in the construction industry, as his chief superintendent of projects.  Jose\u2019s wife, Monica, manages the business\u2019 administrative work and finances.  For the time being, they run the business out of their home to keep operating costs low, though Jose anticipates needing to open an office if business continues growing.  Jose and Monica have three children.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":5575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1672.06,"image":{"id":789952,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cement","sector":"Construction","use":"to

She is a potter; she makes pots with her parents and brother.  \r\n\r\nShe asked for the loan to buy firewood, clay, \u201cgreta\u201d (chemical mixture of copper oxide and lead) and paint to make the pots.  Her parents taught her how to work clay when she was still a little girl.  She started her business ten years ago with some savings she had.  Her business is a family business and she\u2019s proud to be a potter because it\u2019s been their occupation for generations and it\u2019s work that provides food for her and to cover household expenses.  \r\n\r\nShe and her parents go the various farmers markets to sell their wares and use profits to buy more raw materials to continue working.

She started the business six months ago due to the need she had because the money her husband earns from crops is insufficient and this is why she started the business.\r\n\r\nShe will use the loan to buy the ingredients she needs to make her products.

There, she raised her family together with her husband of 27 years, Ignacio.  They had 3 children, who they raised and educated with love and great care.  Now they live alone in their own home.  By working arduously, Melania has been successful in improving her fields.  Every morning, she gets up very early to water her plantings and to offer the same care to her coffee plants and her banana plants.  She sells her fruits in the city of La Merced, which is where she gets the best prices for her products.  What she likes best about her work is that she can enjoy the freedom of working in her fields.  She has been doing this for 30 years and considers that the most difficult part is having to work the soil.  But she sees that she is compensated for her sacrifice when she is able to sell to the wholesalers who frequently visit the area, and from whom she receives good earnings.  She is currently in the midst of the coffee harvest, and she is sure that she will obtain the results she was hoping for.  In addition, she has the support of her husband, who sells fish door-to-door in the settlements in their area.  In time, she hopes to be able to improve her fields so she can plant a lot more coffee.  Melania belongs to the communal bank \u201cAroma de Caf\u00e9\u201d (Coffee Aroma), and this is her fourth loan with MFP, where she hopes for a small loan to achieve her goals.  She promises to, once again, comply with the repayment schedule, like she has with previous loans.  In addition, Melania is thankful for being a part of her communal bank because all of the members are responsible and supportive people.  When Melania receives her support, she will invest the requested money in the purchase of some sacks of organic fertilizer for her coffee plants, which are growing without great difficulty.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":789977,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase some sacks of organic fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-06-14T15:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Melania ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:42:13Z","rounded_local_amount":1035.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621346,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-06-14T22:35:57Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T10:42:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":306448,"name":"Gilberto","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Gilberto tiene 39 a\u00f1os, el es soltero y vive en casa de sus padres, vive en una comunidad  peque\u00f1a ubicada en el campo en una zona rural a 10 minutos  de la ciudad de Lambayeque.\n\nGilberto se dedica a la  comercializaci\u00f3n de animales, entre ellos tenemos principalmente ganado caprino y ovino, haci como aves, los cuales est\u00e1n ubicados en la parte posterior de su domicilio y cuando estos ya han alcanzado un buen punto de desarrollo los ofrece en venta a los negociantes que siempre visitan la zona en donde vive, esta actividad la realiza desde su domicilio.

He owns a parcel of land on which he grows nopal.  Ismael is requesting a loan to buy compost for fertilizing his crop of nopal so that he can produce more to sell.  He also grows corn.  Ismael started his business three years ago.  His father taught him how to work in the fields and grow nopal and corn.  Ismael also raises sheep.  His business is important because it enables him to get ahead and feed his family.  The part he enjoys most is harvesting and selling the nopal.  This type of business is recognized internationally because the nopal is known for its flavor and medicinal properties.  His main challenge is dealing with the weather during the harvest season.  If there is hail, the impact from the hail will leave marks and cuts on the nopal leaves.  \r\n<p>\r\nHis hopes and dreams include increasing his nopal harvest, adding more rooms to his house, growing his sheep business, and seeing that his daughter grows up healthy and lacks nothing in her education.  San Andr\u00e9s Cuauhtempan is a beautiful town and Ismael was born there.  It receives all services and has a mild climate.  The crops that are grown there include corn, nopal, beans, and both red and green tomatoes.   \r\n<p>\r\nThe members of this group would like to say to Kiva and Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad, \u201cThank you for supporting and trusting us with this loan.

She only knew that she had a business opportunity that allowed her to earn money while staying at home with her five children.  At the time, Tracey and her husband, Joe, were supporting their family with his salary as a manager at 7-Eleven and money Tracey made from her eBay business.  Not wanting to go into debt, they started with a modest budget of $145 a month to get Elegant Minerals started.  Now, five years later, Elegant Minerals offers over 300 all-natural cosmetic products to women around the world.\r\n\r\nTracey became interested in all-natural cosmetics after having her third child.  The cosmetic products she used at the time caused her skin to break out, prompting her to begin a trial-and-error period of testing countless cosmetic brands.  She says she tried everything from the most expensive brands to the cheapest without seeing improvement.  As she researched common ingredients used in cosmetics, she discovered that many brands claiming to be \u201call-natural\u201d still use synthetic ingredients that can irritate skin.  Only after switching to cosmetics with 100% all-natural ingredients did her skin improve.  Tracey reasoned that she couldn\u2019t be the only woman whose skin reacted to cosmetics with synthetic ingredients.  With this assumption, she began building the business model for Elegant Minerals.\r\n\r\nElegant Minerals sells its products to people all over the world.  Through online advertising, Elegant Minerals has become known for their affordable and quality cosmetic products.  Recently, Elegant Minerals was recognized on the Martha Stewart Living Radio as one of the best all-natural cosmetic brands.  This summer, Elegant Minerals will be featured in the independent movie \u201cLiquorice.\u201d  Elegant Minerals has donated its products to be used for the actors\u2019 makeup, and will benefit from the publicity of having their products placed in the movie. \r\n\r\nElegant Minerals has a diversified sales approach.  While Tracey estimates that roughly 80% of Elegant Minerals\u2019 sales are through their website, they also sell their products through salons, spas and independent contractors.  Tracey says that the independent contractors tend to be stay-at-home moms wanting to earn a living without sacrificing time with their kids.  Recently, Elegant Minerals reached an agreement with a large cosmetic corporation to sell Elegant Minerals products under the corporation\u2019s name and label.  Regardless of where Elegant Minerals is purchased, the price is always the same.  This diversified sales strategy provides multiple avenues for market penetration.  \r\n\r\nTracey and Joe recently built an addition to their house that will serve as their new office.  The cost of this new addition has put pressure on cash flow they need to maintain their business. This loan will be used to order hairbrushes with their personalized logo.  These hairbrushes are an accessory sold at retail outlets carrying Elegant Minerals\u2019 products.\r\n\r\nHere is the link to their website http:\/\/www.elegantminerals.com\/, and here is the link to a blog post on Martha Stewart\u2019s website discussing Elegant Minerals.  http:\/\/bit.ly\/iVGBPN\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":9100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2122.51,"image":{"id":789992,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to pay for a shipment of hairbrushes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"US","country":"United States","town":"Corpus Christi, Texas","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39.76 -98.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":173,"posted_date":"2011-06-13T08:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":9100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tracey L.

The family of three live in a rented home located in the Puente Paucartambo community ( Peruvian central jungle).  When she was a child her dad had had a company ( factory that made wooden drawers used to pack fruit) and it was there where she learned her current trade.  She no longer works for her father due to consistent health problems that inhibited him from keeping it open. Now, Jessica works 3rd shift and by morning she averages 300 completed drawers daily which are then sold to different parts of the country.  However, some time ago her father-in-law gave her a hectare of farmland where she has already begun planting.  What Jessica likes most is to dedicate the majority of her days tending to her coffee and banana crops.  They have been at it for 2 years now and she feels happy and accomplished since it is her own business, she affirms.  This is why she wants to plant in larger quantities with the 2 hectares of land she inherited from her mother.  This month she made great strides in planting coffee and after much care she will have her 1st harvest in 2 years.  The only thing that bothers her is the far distance of her planting grounds since she has to walk many hours just to get there.  Conscious of her good earnings, she is saving to be able to purchase her own home. \r\nShe belongs to the comunal bank, Luz del Futuro \" (Light of the Future).

As any good man living in the country he is dedicated to farming, which is his main source of income, like many in the area.  For three years he has been working the land and obtained many things, among which is his own 3-acre patch of land on which he grows coffee and bananas.  Everyday he works from the early morning hours taking care of his crops because he knows the money he gets for his produce will depend on harvest quality.  He sells his crops in the La Merced market which is where he gets the most money.  During coffee season he sells his product to a co-op in the Sanchirio del Palomar community.\r\n\r\nWhat he enjoys most about his work is harvest time, when he can reap the fruits of his months of hard work.  He also works as a farm laborer on other farms, where they pay him extra for the care he gives to crops.  In the future he hopes to be able to save enough money to buy a house.

This means that she has to walk a lot and put up with the inclemency of the weather.  She has been working in this way for nearly two years.  Her greatest driving force is her four children for whom she works.  She started off selling for other people but they paid her very little so one day she decided to start working for herself since she had experience.  This helped her a lot.

The brothers decided to set up a repair shop and rented the premises in which they currently work.  In addition to carrying out repair work, they also sell vehicle parts.  They made their business official with Barranquilla's Chamber of Commerce.  In addition to knowing their trade well, they had to locate suppliers and strengthen their promotion work in order to support their business.\r\n\r\nThis is the second loan that Ramiro has applied for through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  He will use it to buy vehicle parts such as pistons, spark plugs, rings, belts, points and brake shoes which will allow him to have merchandise in stock.  While he makes money repairing vehicles, he will also sell the spare parts that are needed to keep vehicles working well.\r\n\r\nRamiro's dream for the future is to own his own premises and expand his product offerings.  However, his biggest challenge is working capital as he doesn't have enough.  This is why he is applying for a Kiva loan.

Her other children are in elementary school and high school.  Her husband is a farmer.\r\n\r\nShe is a housewife.  In order to get her own resources she sells sneakers and Yanbal and Esika products (beauty products, cosmetics, perfume, and women\u2019s accessories).  \r\n\r\nShe also does embroidery work.  She tells us that she does the embroidery work by orders.  Every two weeks a woman from the city of Chone comes to Maribel's house to buy what she has made so far.  She leaves Maribel with more patterns and orders for the next two weeks.  Maribel has been doing this for three years, and it is going very well for her.  She sells the sneakers and Yanbal and Esika products door to door two days a week.\r\n\r\nThis loan is to buy perfume, creams, costume jewelry, and supplies like fabric and thread for the embroideries.  She has been in the communal bank for five cycles.  She likes the help she receives with the loans.\r\n\r\nHer dreams are for her children to become professionals and to have good health.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":790477,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy perfume, creams, costume jewelry, and supplies like fabric and thread.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2011-06-14T16:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":950,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maribel Del Roc\u00edo ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":935,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":77.92},{"due_date":"2011-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":77.92},{"due_date":"2011-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":77.92},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.92},{"due_date":"2011-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":77.92},{"due_date":"2011-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":77.92},{"due_date":"2011-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":77.92},{"due_date":"2011-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":77.92},{"due_date":"2011-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":77.92},{"due_date":"2011-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":77.92},{"due_date":"2011-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":77.92},{"due_date":"2011-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":77.88}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.13}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":77.92,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:04:49Z","rounded_local_amount":79.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216504233,"comment":null},{"amount":158.34,"local_amount":155.84,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:47:25Z","rounded_local_amount":158.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221668176,"comment":null},{"amount":237.51,"local_amount":233.76,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T09:09:58Z","rounded_local_amount":237.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227036923,"comment":null},{"amount":158.34,"local_amount":155.84,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:03:55Z","rounded_local_amount":158.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232797488,"comment":null},{"amount":158.34,"local_amount":155.84,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-17T09:29:18Z","rounded_local_amount":158.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238608582,"comment":null},{"amount":158.3,"local_amount":155.8,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:53:16Z","rounded_local_amount":158.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244562914,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-06-17T11:25:52Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T09:53:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":306535,"name":"Ramona Magdalena","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"En la localidad conocida con el nombre de Pachinche  de la parroquia Colon de la ciudad de Portoviejo lugar conocido por su gente trabajadora y dedicada a la agricultura y la ganader\u00eda cada quince d\u00edas se re\u00fanen los socios del Banco Comunal Damas Emprendedoras De Pachinche.\n\nEn este lugar conocimos a la se\u00f1ora Ramona, tiene 21 a\u00f1os de edad y mantiene una relaci\u00f3n de uni\u00f3n libre de la cual tiene un hijo de 3 a\u00f1os y seis meses el cual es lo m\u00e1s bello de su vida.

Her income is $5 per day, and she has to spend $124 on food, and $13 on electricity per month.  \n\nBecause the income is not enough to support the family, she would like to request a loan of $1,000 to buy land to plant corn so that she can get the benefit from that planting.\n\nShe learned a lot about the career she is doing now (selling cow\u2019s horn) from her mother but this career can earn only a small amount of money, so she needs to find other ways to get more income as now she is in charge of supporting the family. \n\nWith this loan, she expects to buy more planting land so she can plant more corn to get more profit to buy a better house. \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":790559,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy land to plant corn.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Batambong","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":9,"posted_date":"2011-06-20T07:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sopheap","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":56},{"due_date":"2011-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":56},{"due_date":"2011-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":56},{"due_date":"2011-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":56},{"due_date":"2011-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":56},{"due_date":"2011-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":56},{"due_date":"2011-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":56},{"due_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":56},{"due_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":56},{"due_date":"2012-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":56},{"due_date":"2012-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":56},{"due_date":"2012-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":56},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":56},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":56},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":56},{"due_date":"2012-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":56},{"due_date":"2012-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":56},{"due_date":"2012-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":48}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":56,"local_amount":56,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:49:41Z","rounded_local_amount":56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216484272,"comment":null},{"amount":56,"local_amount":56,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-16T07:57:53Z","rounded_local_amount":56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221813806,"comment":null},{"amount":56,"local_amount":56,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-19T07:59:12Z","rounded_local_amount":56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227529870,"comment":null},{"amount":56,"local_amount":56,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-19T07:59:36Z","rounded_local_amount":56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":233327602,"comment":null},{"amount":56,"local_amount":56,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-21T09:08:01Z","rounded_local_amount":56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":239509903,"comment":null},{"amount":56,"local_amount":56,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:32:01Z","rounded_local_amount":56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244610423,"comment":null},{"amount":664,"local_amount":664,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:39:49Z","rounded_local_amount":664,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250825451,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-06-20T12:35:10Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T10:39:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":306548,"name":"Lito","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lito, 30 years old, is married and blessed with one child.
