is a 43-year-old farmer who raises livestock in the small village in the Saatli region. He is married and has three children. He has two years of experience in raising livestock. He started his small business in 1999 when he purchased a cow, and during those many years was selling milk and yogurt to the local people and bazaar traders. But life changed and became difficult, especially in villages. Tahir wanted to improve his life and the conditions of his family, so he started to raise calves and sell them for meat production. During the last two years it has been the only financial source for his family. For a large family of 5 members, it is very hard just to sell only one or two calves every two or three months. So Tahir would like to enlarge his business and purchase more calves for raising and breeding. For this purpose he applied for 700 USD. He will spend this loan purchasing two calves for an estimated price of 300 USD, and then buy fodder for 100 USD."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":90161,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Going to purchase two calves and fodder","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AZ","country":"Azerbaijan","town":"Saatli","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.833333 48.416667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":56,"posted_date":"2007-12-07T03:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tahir","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-12-22T16:58:05Z","disbursal_currency":"AZN","disbursal_amount":595,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":39.67},{"due_date":"2008-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":39.67},{"due_date":"2008-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":39.67},{"due_date":"2008-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":39.67},{"due_date":"2008-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":39.67},{"due_date":"2008-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":39.67},{"due_date":"2008-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":39.67},{"due_date":"2008-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":39.67},{"due_date":"2008-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":39.67},{"due_date":"2008-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":39.67},{"due_date":"2008-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":39.67},{"due_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":39.67},{"due_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":39.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":39.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":39.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":46.67},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":46.67},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":46.67},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":46.67},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":46.67},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":46.67},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":46.67},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":46.67},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":46.67},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":46.67},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":46.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":46.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":46.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":46.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":46.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":47,"local_amount":39.95,"processed_date":"2008-01-22T10:15:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T20:55:00Z","rounded_local_amount":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":120063,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":47,"local_amount":39.95,"processed_date":"2008-02-22T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T20:57:09Z","rounded_local_amount":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":140213,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":47,"local_amount":39.95,"processed_date":"2008-03-22T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T20:58:47Z","rounded_local_amount":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":163764,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":47,"local_amount":39.95,"processed_date":"2008-04-22T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T20:59:50Z","rounded_local_amount":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188744,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":47,"local_amount":39.95,"processed_date":"2008-05-22T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T21:12:26Z","rounded_local_amount":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216685,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":47,"local_amount":39.95,"processed_date":"2008-06-22T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T21:13:34Z","rounded_local_amount":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":245588,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":47,"local_amount":39.95,"processed_date":"2008-07-22T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T21:15:04Z","rounded_local_amount":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":274053,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":47,"local_amount":39.95,"processed_date":"2008-08-22T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T21:18:34Z","rounded_local_amount":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":303550,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":47,"local_amount":39.95,"processed_date":"2008-09-22T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-25T07:09:49Z","rounded_local_amount":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":334391,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":44,"local_amount":37.4,"processed_date":"2008-10-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-28T07:06:41Z","rounded_local_amount":37.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":368488,"comment":"scheduled_repayment (late autopay posting for Aqroinvest Credit Union -

Nevertheless, there is plenty of competition and this means that she must be diligent in the up-keep of her business. She has plans to improve her services in her small establishment, repairing her photo-copy machine as well as the customer space. Afterwards, she would like to work independently in her trained profession as a social worker.\r\n<p> While she continues to work with the photocopier she also has a farm of guinea pigs and chickens. She began this farm with only a small number of animals and would very much like to see their number and variety grow. Angelica is asking for a loan in order to invest in her farm and photocopy business so that she can buy feed and repair her photocopy machine. Your support would be a significant and important contribution to Angelica's businesses and growth. <p> Translated from Spanish by Kiva Volunteer, Kristin Connor.<p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEl amor de madre es un sentimiento incontenible e inmenso para Ang\u00e9lica, que se esfuerza para ofrecerles lo mejor a sus dos peque\u00f1os hijos que son toda su raz\u00f3n y motivaci\u00f3n de vida.

Ella ha contribuido enormemente con el crecimiento del negocio y ha aportado innumerables y novedosas ideas para su consolidaci\u00f3n. Sin duda su mayor anhelo es  tener una casita, en donde poder habitar junto a sus hijos y solicita vuestra ayuda para concretar  sus metas.Contribuyamos todos con esta noble causa."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":90459,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":"Purchase of greater quantity and variety of raw materials to continue making his fine wooden crafts.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2007-12-03T10:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Franco","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-12-17T20:11:19Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2008-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2008-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2008-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2008-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2008-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":166.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":59,"local_amount":168.57,"processed_date":"2008-01-17T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-17T09:09:57Z","rounded_local_amount":177.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":117286,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":59,"local_amount":168.57,"processed_date":"2008-02-17T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-17T09:09:57Z","rounded_local_amount":177.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":137265,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":59,"local_amount":168.57,"processed_date":"2008-03-17T10:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-17T09:09:57Z","rounded_local_amount":177.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":160024,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":59,"local_amount":168.57,"processed_date":"2008-04-17T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-17T09:09:57Z","rounded_local_amount":177.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":184913,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":59,"local_amount":168.57,"processed_date":"2008-05-17T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-17T09:09:57Z","rounded_local_amount":177.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":212552,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":55,"local_amount":157.14,"processed_date":"2008-06-17T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-17T09:09:57Z","rounded_local_amount":165.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":240674,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2007-12-03T20:11:19Z","paid_date":"2008-06-17T09:09:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":25735,"name":"Faalotoina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Faalotoina is a 30 year old mother and is married with 9 children.

worked for many years in a \u201cmaquiladora\u201d (factory\/assembly plant) but, unfortunately, she lost her job during personnel layoffs at the business.  Nevertheless, with the bonus\/severance she received as a result, she was able to purchase a sewing machine and start building a customer base.  At first, she focused solely on hemming or repairing clothes.  She gained the confidence of her customers and today they ask her to make skirts and shorts for them, among other things.  However, her sewing machine broke and now she cannot work the way she needs to.<p>\r\n\r\nShe is asking for a loan of $475USD to be repaid over a five-month term.  With this money she will be able to purchase materials such as thread, buttons, fabrics, remnants, and other items she needs to make clothes.  With your support, Laura and her children will be able to get ahead. <p>\r\n\r\n<p><b> Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn, Kiva Volunteer. <\/b><p>   \r\n\r\nLaura trabaj\u00f3 durante muchos a\u00f1os en una maquiladora desgraciadamente hubo un recorte de personal en su empresa y se qued\u00f3 sin trabajo.

His current space is still very small, making it difficult for him to work on the cars.

There have been times where no cars have been sold during which their debts mounted, forcing them to sell cars for too low a price just to generate some income.  As a result, Mar\u00eda Eugenia resolved herself to start her own business and \u2013 after much careful consideration \u2013 she settled on the concept of selling jewelry to her friends and family.  With earnings from this activity, she would be able to improve her family\u2019s financial situation during difficult times when the sales of used cars are lagging.<p>\r\n\r\nThe winter season is the best time for her business given the demand for holiday gifts.  For this reason, Mar\u00eda Eugenia is asking for a loan of $925USD to be repaid over a six-month period.  She would then be able to purchase more jewelry to offer to her customers.

Fue por es oque comenz\u00f3 a buscar un comercio en el que las ganancias se vieran reflejadas m\u00e1s  r\u00e1pidas y que el movimiento de mercanc\u00eda fuera en poco tiempo. Es por eso que comenz\u00f3 a vender ropa y colchas. Y lo que hace es ir a San Juan de los Lagos Jalisco, que es una ciudad en d\u00f3nde se fabrica ropa por mayoreo y por lo tanto los precios son m\u00e1s bajos que en Victoria y al revenderla le obtiene una buena ganancia. <p>\r\n\r\nSin embargo la temporada de invierno ya lleg\u00f3 y por lo tanto Cipriano considera que es momento de cambiar el tipo de ropa. Es por eso que est\u00e1 solicitando un cr\u00e9dito de US $650 para poder pagarlos en un plazo de 6 meses y con este dinero poder comprar m\u00e1s mercanc\u00eda como ropa de invierno y colchas que mucha gente est\u00e1 comprando puesto que los fr\u00edos ya est\u00e1n llegando. Con tu ayuda la familia de Cipriano podr\u00e1 salir adelante."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":90531,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"Purchase additional merchandise to sell over the winter season.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Victoria, Tamaulipas","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23.733333 -99.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":16,"posted_date":"2007-11-28T12:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cipriano","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-12-12T21:37:40Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":7000,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2008-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2008-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2008-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2008-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2008-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1166.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":108.33},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":108.33},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":108.33},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":108.33},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":108.33},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":108.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":109,"local_amount":1173.85,"processed_date":"2007-12-01T20:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-01T09:02:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1200.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":108364,"comment":"scheduled_repayment (late autopay posting)"},{"amount":109,"local_amount":1173.85,"processed_date":"2008-02-01T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-01T09:02:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1200.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":125631,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":109,"local_amount":1173.85,"processed_date":"2008-03-01T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-01T09:02:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1200.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":146263,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":109,"local_amount":1173.85,"processed_date":"2008-04-01T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-01T09:02:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1200.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":170431,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":109,"local_amount":1173.85,"processed_date":"2008-05-01T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-01T09:02:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1200.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":197514,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":105,"local_amount":1130.77,"processed_date":"2008-06-01T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-01T09:02:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1156.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":224499,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2007-11-28T21:37:40Z","paid_date":"2008-06-01T09:02:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":25758,"name":"Suati","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Suati L., aged thirty, is a loyal wife and a terrific mother to her four children.

A group of 15 ladies are inspired by \"Lovina', so that they used it as their Group's name. This group consist of ladies who are raising pigs. Three ladies were already selected to administer the group by coordinating everything that are involved wwith the group from money management and other activities, like: as Chair person, as Secretary, and as Cashier. In the past, the ladies in this Lovina Group raised their animals the traditional way, since they did not know how to raise pig the right and effective way, so that the results were not maximal. For that matter DINARI took initiative to help this Lovina Group so that they could get ahead in their business. Besides guidance, DINARI is also giving capital loan to each member in the amount of Rp1,400,000 (about US$154)\/member, that afterwards were used to buy feedstock and feed for 1 raising season. With that guidance, and assistance from DINARI, the Lovina Group improves in their Group Management and activities, so that they are convinced to obtain better results in every member's heart. \r\n<p><b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Gwan Liong Ang, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nSetiap mendengar kata Lovina, setiap orang pasti langsung teringat akan sebuah tempat wisata yang indah di bagian barat dari pulau Bali yang juga terkenal dengan kenyamanannya banyaknya kawanan lumba-lumba diperairan tersebut. Sekelompok ibu-ibu yang berjumlah 15 orang terinspirasi oleh \u201dLovina\u201d sehingga mereka memakainya sebagai nama kelompok mereka. Kelompok ini merupakan pekumpulan ibu-ibu yang memelihara  ternak babi. Tiga orang dipilih menjadi pengurus kelompok yang bertugas mengkoordinir  segala hal yang berhubungan dengan kelompok tersebut baik itu dalam keuangan maupun kegiatan-kegiatan yang lainnya., yaitu      sebagai ketua,    sebagai sekretaris, dan    sebagai bendahara.\r\n Dalam perjalanannya ibu-ibu yang tergabung dalam kelompok Lovina memelihara ternaknya dengan cara tradisional karena mereka tidak mengetahui dengan baik cara memelihara babi yang benar dan efektif sehingga hasil yang mereka peroleh tidak maksimal. Berdasarkan hal tersebut DINARI berinisiatif untuk membantu kelompok Lovina untuk bisa maju dalam usahanya. Selain memberikan pembinaan, DINARI juga langsung membantu kelompok dengan memberi pinjaman modal usaha kepada setiap anggota  sejumlah Rp. 1.400.000,- yang kemudian mereka kelola untuk membeli bibit dan biaya pakan untuk 1 kali masa pemeliharaan.  \r\nDengan mendapat bimbingan dan pendampingan dari DINARI, kelompok Lovina mulai mengalami perbaikan baik dalam manajemen kelompok maupun dalam aktifitas usaha yang digeluti sehingga keyakinan untuk mendapat hasil yang lebih baik pun ada dalam hati setiap anggota."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2250,"image":{"id":90650,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy pig

Farming and opening a kiosk is her choice occupation, since in that business she could still be a house mother. Kiosk business has been her occupation for a while, however results is far from maximal. Starting from selling few family items main needs,  Ni Ketut Sari plans to increase the items for sale so that her customers could get it readily from her kiosk. From the Rp4000,000 (about  US$420) capital, Ni Ketut Sari could sell Rp200,000 (about US$ 21), at a nett profit of Rp15,000 (US$1.60). With the requested additional loan to Dinari, Ni Ketut Sari hopes to add capital that she could turn around, and profit could double today's. Therefore it would increase family's income.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Gwan Liong Ang, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nSebagai istri dari suami yang bekerja sebagai seorang petani , Ni Ketut Sari dituntut untuk mampu membantu suami dalam hal menambah pendapatan keluarga. Bertani sekaligus membuka usaha warung  merupakan pilihan hidup yang dia jalani, karena dengan usaha itu ia masih dapat mengerjakan semua aktifitas sebagai ibu rumah tangga. Usaha warung  sudah lama dia tekuni, akan tetapi belum mampu memperoleh hasil yang maksimal.\r\nBerawal dari menjual beberapa macam  kebutuhan  pokok keluarga  , Ni Ketut Sari berencana menambah macam barang yang akan ditawarkan agar pelanggan yang membutuhkan barang akan dapat tersedia di warungnya.  Dari Modal Rp. 4.000.000.- yang dia punya selama ini setiap harinya Ni Ketut Sari mendapat penjualan sebesar Rp. 200.000,- dengan keuntungan bersih Rp. 15.000,-. Dengan penambahan modal yang diajukan ke DINARI Ni Ketut Sari berharap akan bisa menambah modal yang akan diputar kembali dan keuntungan yang diperoleh akan dapat meningkat 2 kali lipat dari sekarang.

Kelompok ini membentuk suatu kepengurusan yang diketuai oleh Ni Ketut Suci Ariani, dengan sekretaris Ni Putu Sukawati dan Bendahara Ni Ketut Sudiantari. Kelompok ini beranggotakan 8 Orang.\r\nDalam kegiatannya kelompok ini melakukan beberapa kegiatan diantaranya adalah melakukan simpan pinjam dalam kelompok dan juga mereka melakukan kegiatan memelihara ternak Babi di rumah mereka masing-masing. Kegiatan memelihara babi ini sudah lama mereka tekuni bersama dengan keluarganya masing \u2013 masing , tetapi dalam pemeliharaanya masih mempergunakan cara yang tradisiaonal sehingga mereka tidak mendapatkan hasil yang maksimal. Melalui Yayasan  Dinari kelompok ini medapat pembinaan dan penyuluhan mengenai pengelolaan kelompok , management kelompok maupun pendampingan dalam pemeliharaan babi serta dukungan pinjaman dana. Dengan penambahan pinjaman dana  yang masing \u2013masing anggota sebesar Rp 2.500.000,- mereka dapat mengalokasikan untuk membeli 8 ekor bibit babi @ Rp 250 000,- dan  Rp 500 000,- untuk biaya pakan, kelompok akan bisa memperbaiki kwalitas pakan dan juga jenis babi yang unggul . \r\nKelompok Segara Mandala setelah 5 bulan masa pemeliharaanya akan menjual babinya bersama sama dengan dikoordinir

The reason for her confidence is because meat is in very high demand in Azerbaijan. Azerbaijani people eat meat almost every day. As she and her husband are unemployed, calf sales is the only financial source for her family. Tezgul works very hard to keep her family in good conditions, however, it is very hard when you have a big family and the prices for products increase almost every day.

Due to her family\u2019s financial situation, she left home at the age of 13 to live with her grandfather in Boane, where she lives until today. In 1970 Rasse began a small business in order to survive. She got married in 1973 and today has 6 children. Rasse took out her first loan through a small association called G.G.L.S. in Matola that offered credit to groups. It was not a good experience because, besides the loans being very small, the borrowers had to take responsibility for anyone in the group who defaulted on their part of the loan. <p>Rasse heard about Hluvuku through her friends, and applied for her first loan to purchase products. She intends to use the 15,000.00 MT to increase her supply of merchandise, and with the profits provide for her family\u2019s needs and her children\u2019s education. She is currently hoping to have her own building in a good business environment.<p> Rasse\u2019s business has a significant impact on the community because it offers clients easy access to her products, and it provides work for her and her children, who are older but without employment opportunities. Rasse runs the business herself, and her children help out when she\u2019s absent. In the future, Rasse would like to have a safe, brick building. <p> <b> Translated from Portuguese by Jill Haring, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nLocalizacao : bairro 4\r\nCliente : Rasse Antonio

is a 31-year-old woman who devotes herself to selling general merchandise, including electronics, audio equipment, and books. She is a single mother with a nine-year-old son who is currently attending a public school in the area. They both live at Margarita\u2019s parents\u2019 home, where she and her son share a bedroom.  Hers is a one-man business, and she has four and a half years of experience with this type of work. During this time, thanks to her sacrifice, she has been able to make it grow.  Her competency in the field is partly due to the fact that there are few vendors that devote themselves to electronic and audio items.  The key to her success is excellent customer service and prices that are within reach of her clientele.  With the current loan request, she will purchase: <br>\r\n* 10 AKITA stereos for $500 <br>\r\n* 6 AKITA radios for $180 <br>\r\n* 3 ceramic boxes for assorted gifts for $150 <br>\r\n* 3 boxes of children\u2019s novelty toys for $170 <Br>\r\nHer current request is the third that Margarita has made from Agrocapital. Her previous credits were for $1500 and $2500 respectively, and both were paid off responsibly and on time. She has no negative history in her credit record.<p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Shannon Skoglund, Kiva volunteer. <\/b><p>\r\n\r\nMargarita es una se\u00f1ora de 31 a\u00f1os de edad, se dedica al comercio de art\u00edculos en general, artefactos electr\u00f3nicos, musicales y de librer\u00eda.\r\nMargarita es madre soltera de un ni\u00f1o de 9 a\u00f1os de edad, que actualmente est\u00e1 estudiando en un colegio fiscal de la zona. \r\nAmbos viven en el domicilio de los padres de Margarita, donde comparten un dormitorio para ella y su hijo.\r\nEl negocio es de tipo Unipersonal, cuenta con una experiencia en el rubro de cuatro a\u00f1os y medio, en los cuales, gracias a su sacrificio, pudo lograr que el mismo creciera.\r\nLa competencia en la zona es mediana debido a que hay pocos puestos de comerciantes que se dedican a la comercializaci\u00f3n de artefactos electr\u00f3nicos y musicales.

Before joining TYM, her life was very difficult.  Her husband Le Xuan Tu is a veteran.  He did not have a fixed job; their children are all small; and they did not have any fund to start a business.  Since 1992, she started to borrow from TYM Fund but she did not use her loan quite effectively.  In 1999, with the new trend of economic model that focuses on all three components: farming, fishing, and breeding, Mrs. T. discussed with her family and decided to change to his new model.  She now has 3.2 acres of garden, 7 perches of pond with hundreds of fruit trees, and 750 ducks, chickens, and grooses.  She would like to borrow 450USD to buy food for her poultry.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Vietnamese by Phuong Nguyen, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nCh\u1ecb Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb Th\u00e0nh l\u00e0 m\u1ed9t trong nh\u1eefng th\u00e0nh vi\u00ean \u0111\u1ea7u ti\u00ean c\u1ee7a Qu\u1ef9 T\u00ecnh th\u01b0\u01a1ng t\u1ea1i x\u00e3 Minh Ph\u00fa.

Little by little, and with a lot of faith, she started gathering customers and now she is recognized in her neighborhood as the woman who sells the cosmetic products.<P>\r\nHowever, she currently does not have a lot of merchandise to do demonstrations. Celia realized that the best way to sell and make the most of her time is to do demonstrations in the homes of her customers, gathering more women, so that they put in a larger order. Right now she has an order to fulfill and she wants to do more demonstrations and this is why she is requesting a loan for US$325, which she is willing to pay in a period of 5 months. With this money Celia will be able to buy more merchandise to fulfill her orders. With your help, Celia will be able to support her children.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Eliana Colunga, Kiva volunteer.<p><\/b>\r\n\r\nCelia es madre soltera de tres peque\u00f1itos y en su trabajo no le pagan lo suficiente como para mantener a los tres ni\u00f1os y darles escuela.
