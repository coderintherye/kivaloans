Her sales vary depending on the merchandise she has to offer on a given day.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda has been doing this for eight years and began because her daughter had gotten sick with pancreatic cystic fibrosis.  Starting from scratch was difficult and involved many sacrifices because she also had to pay for her daughter\u2019s medicines.  She started out selling raffle tickets, but it didn\u2019t bring in enough money, so she began selling second-hand clothing out of her home and began saving up to buy packs of clothing.  Now she buys her merchandise, packs of clothing, in Santiago.\r\n\r\nShe will use the money from this loan to buy 15 packs, specifically pants, undergarments, children\u2019s and house clothes. \r\nHer goals are to have a local establishment to be able to offer and sell her merchandise (clothing), and to also have a vehicle that will allow her to transport the clothing to different parts of the city, and be able to sell to those who do not have their own transportation.\r\nMar\u00eda lives with her husband and three children, ages 20, 17, and 15, and also cares for one of her nephews who is eight years old.  Her children help her to transport the clothing to the fair, set up the stall and iron the clothes from the packs.\r\n\r\nHer motivations to continue and to succeed in her business are the help she gets from her family, especially her children.\r\nMar\u00eda is very happy and grateful to Fondo Ezperanza and affirms that without their support she would not have been able to continue with her business.

She lives in her own house in the municipality of Cojutepeque, in the department of Cuscatl\u00e1n. Eyddy has a small business: a beauty salon in which she has worked hard so that she can have what she needs. She has also specialized in providing the best possible service to her customers. Recently, she has noticed a strong increase in demand for her products and services, which has led her to think that she needs to equip her beauty salon better, because more customers will require more products, and she does not want to disappoint them. This led her to make a very important decision: to request this loan from INTEGRAL, which will allow her to expand her business and buy more beauty articles such as shampoos, hair creams, body creams, makeup, hair coloring, nail polish and other items that are attractive to her customers. She is confident that in this way she will be able to increase her sales and thus her earnings, which will allow her to improve her quality of life.

She earns a minimum of 200 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her variety store, she is requesting a 14,000 PHP loan. She plans to use this loan to buy more products like groceries, toiletries and beverages so as to expand her product inventory.

She is a very caring lady who makes the utmost effort to provide comfort to her family by fulfilling their needs.\r\n\r\nHer husband is involved in a scrap business. His shop is located in the market and he supplies scrap to different scrap dealers and factories. He is the only earning person in the family. That\u2019s why it is very necessary for him to improve his business conditions. Shamim has applied for a loan from Kiva partner Asasah for her husband\u2019s business. He will purchase scrap like plastic bottles, used papers etc. Shamim hopes that the loan investment will bring positive financial changes to her husband\u2019s business and improve the living standard of her family. She is a regular loan user of Asasah and this is her second loan application. In her previous loan year, she proved herself as a responsible client by paying the installments on time and by attending every meeting. \r\n\r\nNote:\u201cIn the photo, the lady raising her hand is Shamim.

She is 56 years old. In 1973, after graduating from high school, Olga entered accounting school.  Later, in 1983, she started studying Russian Language and Literature at the Institute of the Humanities.  In her senior year, Olga married and her sons were born one after another.  In 1987, after she graduated, Olga was sent to teach Russian in Boroldoy villiage.  After working there for more than six years, Olga decided not to return to Bishkek but to live in the village. In spite of the fact that Olga's family was city dwellers, once they got to the country they built themselves a family farm.  They bought a calf, then a cow, and they cultivated a small plot of land that the rural administration has allocated for growing feed. \r\n\r\nOlga\u2019s hardest time was 2004.  Her eldest son died, and then a bit later, her husband died of a heart attack. In a short time Olga lost two of the closest people in her life.  After her son and husband died, Olga found herself unable to function.  Eventually, her teaching work gave her reason to continue living. \r\nIn January, 2010 Olga applied for her first loan from Bai Tushun and Partners, and received 30,000 som (KGS) which she used to buy cattle. Now Olga\u2019s family farm contains two cows. Olga plans to take out a second loan for 60,000 som (KGS) to further expand her herd.\r\n\r\nOlga believes that her students will attain greatness in life and become some of the world\u2019s most outstanding figures.\r\n\r\nBai-Tushum and Partners uses Kiva funding to target the especially vulnerable population. Bai-Tushum and Partners is one of the leading microfinance institutions in Kyrgyzstan. As a reliable financial partner, Bai-Tushum contributes to the economic development of the Kyrgyz Republic through the delivery of microfinance services in rural and urban areas that lead to increased employment and meet the interests of its clients and investors.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":756572,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to  purchase cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Boroldoy village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Olga","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":60000,"loan_amount":1300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2012-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":30000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":650},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":650,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:42:40Z","rounded_local_amount":30490.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263250520,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-05-01T22:13:47Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":294231,"name":"Felipa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Felipa R. is from the village of West Kibawe, Kibawe, Bukidnon.

Ph\u01b0\u1ee3ng is the group leader of a four-member group loan offered by Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is 81 Qu\u1ea3ng H\u01b0ng (18.1.81 Qu\u1ea3mg H\u01b0ng).\n\nPh\u01b0\u1ee3ng is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Ph\u01b0\u1ee3ng operates a service-based business. The main source of income for the business comes primarily from providing hotel services to local community members.  Ph\u01b0\u1ee3ng has been engaged in this business for over five years and earns approximately 2,100,000 Vietnamese dong a month from these activities.\n\nIn 2011, Ph\u01b0\u1ee3ng joined Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Ph\u01b0\u1ee3ng is requesting for the first loan from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  The new loan of 4,248,000 VND will be used to invest in expanding the business. Ph\u01b0\u1ee3ng plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.\n\nAbout the Other Borrowers in the Group:\n\n1.  H\u1eb1ng  (152) is a 33-year-old female who is requesting a 4,248,000 VND loan to support her food stall.\n\n2.

Arifwala is known for its agriculture industry. She has been living there in a 2-room brick house for the past 10 years. She is married to A. G. and has three children. All of them are very young and studying in a local school. Salma is a housewife, staying at home and doing her household responsibilities.  \r\n\r\nHer husband has an animal-selling business. His business grows busier during the Muslim festival of Eid-ul-Azha because people purchase animals to slaughter. At other times he sells animals to butchers.

Last year, Mrs. Tsagaantsooj started building a family house. It is 70 percent complete. The house was built with wooden beams. Some of the walls are covered with basalt wool for insulation purposes. Now she needs to buy more building materials to finish the building work by putting insulation under the floor, on the walls, and under the roof. The Mongolian winter is one of the harshest in the world, reaching minus 45 degrees at night. Therefore, houses need to be well insulated. A well-insulated house burns less charcoal, emitting less poisonous smoke into the air. The loan will be used to buy basalt wool, metal sheets, cement, bricks, and other necessary materials to insulate the house well and complete the housing project."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":603.4,"image":{"id":760000,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

O. O. is a married man. His wife is a businesslady and they have six children aged between twenty-seven and thirteen years old. His business is located at the busy Nyalenda market in Kisumu. Kisumu is the region in Kenya that harbors the Lake Victoria and is commonly referred to as the lake basin. \r\n\r\nAyub runs a general store in which he sells items such as beverages, sugar, detergents, flour, cooking oil, etc. to the local people. He has been running this business for five years now. He says that this business is profitable and the major challenge he has is that there are other people in the area doing the same business, and thus his customers are not loyal as they are spoilt for choice.

Thanks to her effort and dedication she has managed to secure a better income. Her children go to a private school, she has 4 sewing machines for her business, but above all, her family has a better quality of life. Barbara says that she is now saving to purchase an industrial sewing machine. The loan that she was granted will be used to purchase merchandise (fabrics, thread, etc.). We know that Barbara will meet her goals with a great deal of work and effort and that the loans granted to her by Edaprospo (Kiva Field Partner) will help her."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2025,"image":{"id":760243,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"to purchase fabrics and thread.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Huaycan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.083333 -76.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2011-04-29T13:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2025,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Barbara Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cristina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luzmila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Presentacion","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lily Victoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nora Dina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Violeta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Valentina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-04-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":5700,"loan_amount":2025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1425},{"due_date":"2011-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1425},{"due_date":"2011-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1425},{"due_date":"2011-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1425}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":506.25},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":506.25},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":506.25},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":506.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":506.25,"local_amount":1425,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:58:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1431.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211208766,"comment":null},{"amount":506.25,"local_amount":1425,"processed_date":"2011-06-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-19T07:54:01Z","rounded_local_amount":1431.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216969368,"comment":null},{"amount":506.25,"local_amount":1425,"processed_date":"2011-07-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:39:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1431.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221650204,"comment":null},{"amount":506.25,"local_amount":1425,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:50:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1431.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227018092,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-04-29T21:39:59Z","paid_date":"2011-09-15T08:50:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":294479,"name":"Recardina Carlos","description":{"languages":["pt","en"],"texts":{"pt":"\nRecardina Carlos F. nasceu na cidade de Matola, Prov\u00edncia de Maputo, sul de Mo\u00e7ambique casada m\u00e3e de 3 filhos de 05, 10 e 18 anos de  idade todos va\u00f5 a Escola.

Rosa has 8 years of experience with her business and would love to one day make and sell a wiD. variety of garments and always have plenty of materials on-hand to meet demand. She started her business with some help from her brother and the support of her group members. \r\n\r\nThe other members of the Superaci\u00f2n Group work in clothing making, native garment sales, animal raising and selling, and pottery making and selling. This is the second loan through ASDIR for this group of women. The previous loan was paid back ahead of schedule with no problem.

She\u2019s been doing this for 23 years and enjoys collecting the fruits of her labor.  In this way she receives the reward, thanks to the effort she puts into her crops.  Never the less, the most difficult part is transporting her products to their point of sale in the city of San Francisco, where she can sell her harvest for better prices.\r\n\r\nDuring the harvest season, she\u2019s able to get some help from her children, and also hires field hands, in order to be able to collect the crops quicker.

This is why she has seen fit to request this loan though MFP.\r\n\r\nAt this time her biggest priority is to plant her cacao crops, because she has enough space in her fields.  This will be her 12th loan through MFP and she has always been on time with her payments.  She expects to be on time this time as well.  The will use the 2,000 PEN from this loan to hire field hands to help her collect her fruits.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":760286,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to hire field hands","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-04-30T18:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eugenia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-04-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":725,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:32:30Z","rounded_local_amount":2049.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263385296,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-04-30T20:11:50Z","paid_date":"2012-03-15T10:32:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":294502,"name":"Adjoa Authur","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Adjoa Authur K. makes a living selling banku, a Ghanaian staple made of fermented maize and cassava, at Eguafo Village near Elmina.

Julio is a man who works every day for the welfare of his children. His work consists of working the land. He is a farmer and he has 6 hectares of land where he cultivates cocoa and coffee. These are native plants to the jungle region of Valle Rio Apurimac. Seventeen years have passed and today he continues with the business to forge a future for his children. In turn, they help him during the harvest and he also hires farm hands especially because this work requires a great deal of effort and expediency to harvest the entire product to sell to the distributing companies. They pay him very well for each kilogram of product that he sells. He considers the most difficult part is having to transport his products from the fields to the city of San Francisco. That is where they give him better prices for his products. For the moment the priority is to purchase more cocoa seeds as he has enough room to plant them. This is his 12th loan with MFP (Kiva Field Partner) and he is committed to making his payments on time, as he wishes to access future loans. In this communal bank, he is a very involved member.
