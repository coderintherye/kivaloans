Ubicado alrededor de una hora y media al sur de Lima, Mala, con sus playas de arena, ruinas pre-incas, y la producci\u00f3n del adorado nacional licor de Per\u00fa, el Pisco (una especie de aguardiente de uva), ha sido durante mucho tiempo un destino tur\u00edstico para los peruanos adinerados. Mala es una ciudad c\u00e1lida y tranquila con una gran poblaci\u00f3n afro-peruana, los restos de un camino ind\u00edgena, y las influencias del imperio espa\u00f1ol. La ciudad, junto con otros cerca de la costa del Pac\u00edfico, fue da\u00f1ado durante el 2001 y 2007 terremotos,  pero ha soportado como lo ha hecho durante gran parte de su historia.

Mala, with its sandy beaches, pre-Incan ruins and its production of Peru's much-loved national liquor - Pisco (a type of grape brandy) - has long been a tourist destination for wealthy Peruvians.  Mala is a warm and peaceful city with a large afro-Peruvian population.  The rest are indigenous people and people with roots in the Spanish Empire.  This city, together with other nearby cities on the Pacific coast, was damaged during the 2001 and 2007 earthquakes but it survived as it has done throughout most of its history.\r\n\r\nIn her free time, Maria enjoys going for walks with her children.  It is well known that Peru has the most delicious food in the world and one of the dishes that Maria really enjoys is 'lomo saltado' (stir-fried sirloin).  Maria is single and studied to be a pharmacist.  She has two children.  Her eldest son is 19 years old and is studying at University.  Her youngest is 14 and is in his second year of high school.  Maria is very happy with her children.  They are the reason she works hard every day.  She would like them to do better than she has done and in spite of everything, including the fact that she is a single mother, she manages to get them ahead in life.\r\n\r\nMaria Isabel sells medicines in her pharmacy.  She works 11 hours a day.  She was encouraged because she saw that this type of business was well received.  Each day, Maria Isabel can serve 80 customers and this allows her to earn, on average, 150 soles a day.  On a good day, she can earn 300 soles.  This helps her with some additional expenses and she is able to invest in her business.  She believes that her business is doing well because of the patience that she has with her customers and the quality of her products.  Maria is very grateful to Kiva lenders because, thanks to their support, she will be able to buy more medicines for her business and make some improvements in expanding her premises.  This improvement will enable her to have the right medicines available and continue providing her customers with a good service.  In this way, she will be able to save up to fulfill her big dream: to have a chain of pharmacies in neighboring areas and to ensure her children have a profession."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":79.76,"image":{"id":968429,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pharmacy","sector":"Health","use":"to buy medicines and expand her premises","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Mala","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2011-12-30T12:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":212.69},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":231.88},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":236.08},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":246.31},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":253.75},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":264.02},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":272.71},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":282.56}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.76},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.95},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.53},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.37},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.16},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.27},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.96}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":79.76,"local_amount":212.69,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:45:53Z","rounded_local_amount":215.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257142576,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-12-30T16:45:52Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":376942,"name":"Diomedes Armando","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Diomedes, es agricultor y ganadero, vive en casa propia, con tres hijos, \u00e9l inicio este oficio por iniciativa propia, trabaja en sus propias tierras, no tiene un horario establecido.\nActualmente est\u00e1 solicitando un pr\u00e9stamo para comprar una vaca y un ternero, para aumentar sus cr\u00edas en el corral, esta compra le ayudara a tener m\u00e1s ganado y con la esperanza de en un futuro recibir mayores ganancias de esta compra.\n\u00c9l tiene como objeto, pagar este pr\u00e9stamo muy bien, realizar una buena inversi\u00f3n, estar al pendiente de sus hijos.\n","en":"Diomedes is a farmer and cattle rancher.

Felipe is proud of what he grows, because currently he is having a better reception from the traders and hence better prices for his agricultural crops.\r\n\r\nIn the future he wants to open a business selling staple products for which he needs a suitable and safe facility. \r\n\r\nThis will be his first loan with MFP, and Felipe promises to make his payments on time in accordance with the schedule. With the 3000 soles he will buy corrugated iron to put a roof on his new home.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":562.5,"image":{"id":968509,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"to buy corrugated iron to put a roof on his home\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-01-01T23:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Felipe ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":199.85},{"due_date":"2012-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":210.65},{"due_date":"2012-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":224.42},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":226.39},{"due_date":"2012-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":237.13},{"due_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":240.91},{"due_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":255.83},{"due_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":261.14},{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":270.59},{"due_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":281.42},{"due_date":"2012-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":290.57},{"due_date":"2012-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":301.1}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.94},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.16},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.89},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.93},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.34},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.93},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.93},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.47},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.53},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.97},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.91}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":562.5,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:18:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1516.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257246219,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-12T23:23:34Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":376956,"name":"Doris Xiomara","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Doris, vive con su esposo en casa familiar, ella tiene una tienda de productos de primera necesidad como: aceite, arroz, jugos, gaseosas, gatorade, churros, galletas, el negocio lo inicio junto a su madre, trabaja de lunes a domingo.\nEl pr\u00e9stamo lo utilizara para comprar la mercader\u00eda necesaria para surtir su negocio como: jab\u00f3n, detergentes, champoo,entre otros que de esa manera podr\u00e1 mejorar su inventario y sus ventas cada d\u00eda ser\u00e1n mejores.\nLa aspiraci\u00f3n de Doris es que cada d\u00eda atender mejor a sus clientes brindarles los productos que m\u00e1s necesitan y ayudar para los gastos de la casa.\n","en":"Doris lives with her husband in the family home.

She is married, 35 years old, and has a 5 year old son. She is a merchant who for 12 years has been making and selling pi\u00f1atas. She began thanks to her husband\u2019s encouragement to learn handicrafts. She liked it, and well, it aroused creativity in her that she couldn\u2019t believe she had. Of all the things she learned to make what she loved the most was learning to make pi\u00f1atas for the children.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning she gave them away to her close friends, and they said she could sell them as they are very pretty and well made. She also makes cards, gift boxes, and flowers.

Ica se encuentra ubicado en el Desierto de Sechura cerca de cuatro horas al sur de Lima, la capital del pa\u00eds, y es aclamado por los peruanos como \"La Tierra del Sol\". Es conocida en el Per\u00fa por sus frecuentes terremotos (un 8,0 en 2007 y 6.9 en 2011), su producci\u00f3n de uvas, esp\u00e1rragos y aceitunas, y tal vez sobre todo, como la fuente de la bebida tradicional del Per\u00fa nacional, el Pisco. En este clima c\u00e1lido y \u00e1rido se encuentra la casa y empresa del cliente.  En su tiempo libre Maria disfruta de jugar v\u00f3ley;  como bien se sabe el Per\u00fa se caracteriza por tener las comidas m\u00e1s deliciosas del mundo y uno de los platos que a Maria le agrada mucho es el \u201cArroz con Pato\u201d, Mar\u00eda estudio hasta el quinto a\u00f1o de secundaria, pero le hubiera gustado mucho estudiar Secretariado Ejecutivo;  Mar\u00eda es conviviente y su pareja trabaja como locutor de radio, ella nos dice que su pareja le habla como si estuviera en una radio cuando ella  est\u00e1 molesta y asi la hace reir. \n\n\"Maria Jesus se dedica a la  venta de ceviche y chilcano, (el ceviche es un platillo a base de pescados de mariscos al cual se le a\u00f1ade el zumo de lim\u00f3n, se adereza con sal y aji amarillo o rocoto para darle picante y el chilcano es una sopa a base de la cocci\u00f3n de la cabeza del pescado, es un platillo riqu\u00edsimo sobre todo porque es muy buena fuente de fosforo y vitaminas), se dedica a este trabajo 6 horas diarias,  Maria se animo a tener este negocio gracias a su pareja,  ya que el la animo mucho porque ve\u00eda que hab\u00eda mucha acogida de parte de los pobladores de su barrio. En un d\u00eda Maria puede atender 80 clientes de manera diaria, esto le permite ganar  hasta S\/. 150 diarios y en un buen d\u00eda puede ganar hasta S\/. 250  lo que le ayuda en algunos gastos adicionales  y tambi\u00e9n para invertir en el negocio, ella cree que le va bien en el negocio porque tiene muy buena saz\u00f3n en la preparaci\u00f3n de los platillos y porque es muy ordenada en su negocio. Maria esta muy agradecida con los prestatarios Kiva ya que con el apoyo brindado ella podr\u00e1 comprar mesas y sillas para su negocio ya que las que tiene no son suficientes para la cantidad de personas que ella atiende.\n\nEsta mejora podr\u00e1 ayudarle a esta mejora le permitir\u00e1 que m\u00e1s clientes ingresen a su negocio ya que tendr\u00e1 mas lugares para que ellos se sienten a disfrutar de sus platillos y as\u00ed poder en algunos meses  lo que lo ayudar\u00e1 a cumplir su gran sue\u00f1o: Tener un Restaurante.\"\n","en":"34-year old Maria Jesus lives in Ica, Peru. The town is located in the Sechura desert, about four hours south of Lima, the capital of the country and is called the \u2018Land of the Sun\u2019 by Peruvians.  Ica is known for the frequency of earthquakes (one at 8.0 level occurred in 2007, and another at 6.9 in 2011), its grapes, asparagus, olives, and of course as the home of Peru\u2019s national drink, pisco sour. \r\n\r\nMaria\u2019s home and business are located in this warm and arid place. In her free time she enjoys playing volleyball. Peru is known for having the best food in the world, and one of the dishes that Maria loves is Arroz con Pato (rice with duck). She has five years of high school education and would have liked to go on to be an executive secretary. She lives with her partner who is a radio announcer. When she is upset, he talks to her as if he were on the radio and makes her laugh.\r\n\r\nMaria earns her living selling ceviche and chilcano (ceviche is a seafood dish to which lemon juice, salt, and chili or rocoto pepper have been added to make it spicy; chilcano is a soup made from a fish head--it\u2019s delicious as well as being a good source of phosphorus and vitamins). She works six hours a day and was encouraged in the business by her partner who saw that the local people really enjoyed her food. In one day Maria might serve 80 customers and earn S\/. 150. On a good day she can earn up to S\/. 250 which helps her pay for additional expenses and also invest in the business. She thinks that all is going well as she is such a good cook and because she is well organized. \r\n\r\nMaria is very grateful to Kiva donors as with the loan she will be able to buy tables and chairs for the business as she doesn\u2019t have enough at the moment for all her customers. With this improvement she will be able to serve more people who come to enjoy her food. In turn, this extra income will help her to achieve her dream: in a few more months she hopes to open a restaurant.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":55.38,"image":{"id":968737,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"to buy tables and chairs for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ica","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2011-12-30T16:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Jesus","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":147.68},{"due_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":159.89},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":163.69},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":170.32},{"due_date":"2012-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":175.93},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":182.49}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.38},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.96},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.38},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.87},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.98},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":55.38,"local_amount":147.68,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:57:13Z","rounded_local_amount":149.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263271156,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-12-30T22:33:44Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":376974,"name":"Johanna Yomayra","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Se\u00f1orita.

In this hot and arid climate we find the house and enterprise of our client. In his free time he enjoys, especially, listening to music because it relaxes him and provides tranquility.

His brothers motivated him to do this because there is little transportation in the barrio where he lives and, above all, because he is young and very determined and a hard-worker. In a day, Luis attends to 50 customers and this gives him around 70 new sols daily. On a good day he can earn up to 90 new sols, which helps him cover some added costs and invest in his business. He feels that the business is going well because there is much need for transportation and because he treats his customers with much respect. \r\n\r\nHe feels very grateful to the Kiva loaners, since with their offer of aid, he is able to maintain the vehicle which is his work tool. This improvement loan will enable him to restore his vehicle to perfect order and he won't suffer breakdowns that could cause an accident.

He will earn more income and saving more, he will fulfill his grand dream: \u201cHaving a fleet of moto-taxis.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":51.93,"image":{"id":968771,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","use":"maintain his moto-taxi.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Parcona","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2011-12-30T19:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luis Enrique","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":68.58},{"due_date":"2012-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":69.89},{"due_date":"2012-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":74.52},{"due_date":"2012-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":75.18},{"due_date":"2012-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":78.78},{"due_date":"2012-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":80.82},{"due_date":"2012-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":84.44},{"due_date":"2012-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":86.87},{"due_date":"2012-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":90.05},{"due_date":"2012-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":93.7},{"due_date":"2012-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":96.78},{"due_date":"2012-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":100.39}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.72},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.21},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.94},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.19},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.55},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.3},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.58},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.76},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.14},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.29},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":25.72,"local_amount":68.58,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:45:56Z","rounded_local_amount":69.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257142564,"comment":null},{"amount":26.21,"local_amount":69.89,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:57:35Z","rounded_local_amount":70.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263271158,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-22T00:45:54Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":376978,"name":"Rosa Lidubina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Se\u00f1ora.

In his spare time he enjoys repairing motorcycles.  As he well knows, Peru is known for having the most delicious food in the world and one of Guillermo\u2019s favorite dishes is \u201cSeco de Cabrito.\u201d  Guillermo studied up to eleventh grade due to his parent\u2019s economic problems; he would have liked to study Auto Mechanics.\r\n\r\nGuillermo works as a mototaxi driver but his drive to get ahead is so strong that he also works very hard in his motorcycle repair shop.  He spends about 11 hours daily at both jobs and tells us that without sacrifice, there is no growth.  His friends encouraged him because he\u2019s very skilled in vehicle repair and because he knows how to drive and is a very prudent driver.\r\n\r\nIn a typical day, Guillermo can tend to 50 customers which produces a 30-sol daily profit for him and on a good day he might earn up to 60 soles which helps him cover some additional household expenses or to invest in the business.  He believes that he does well in his business because he finishes his jobs on time, he\u2019s honest and responsible but, above all, very honest and this is why his customers seek him out and recommend him to others.\r\n\r\nGuillermo is very grateful to Kiva lenders because he\u2019ll be able to use the loan to remodel his workshop and his house.  This improvement will help him have a better environment in which to carry out his work and this will create a better quality of life since his income will improve and in a few months he\u2019d like to have a larger workshop that will help him reach his great dream: \u201cTo have his own house.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":79.12,"image":{"id":969590,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Repair","sector":"Services","use":"to remodel his shop and his house.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ica","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2011-12-30T18:10:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Guillermo Felix","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":99.65},{"due_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":106.75},{"due_date":"2012-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":110.52},{"due_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":113.02},{"due_date":"2012-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":118.45},{"due_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":121.49},{"due_date":"2012-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":126.93},{"due_date":"2012-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":130.59},{"due_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":135.37},{"due_date":"2012-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":140.86},{"due_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":145.48},{"due_date":"2012-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":150.89}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.2},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.92},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.37},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.32},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.41},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.57},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.65},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.06},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.9},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.99},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.77},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":38.2,"local_amount":99.65,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:46:01Z","rounded_local_amount":102.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257142565,"comment":null},{"amount":40.92,"local_amount":106.75,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:57:52Z","rounded_local_amount":110.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263271159,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-24T18:08:00Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":377158,"name":"Felipe","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Felipe es una es persona trabajadora que su objetivo en la vida es de mejorar su vivienda donde habita con su familia, con mucho esfuerzo la ha acondicionado poco a poco para darles a sus hijos una vivienda digna, que por falta de capital no ha terminado las mejoras que el necesidad realizarle a la vivienda.

One business owner was so impressed with Meiko\u2019s cookies, that he ordered 115 dozen to be shipped across the United States as gifts for his clients.  Needless to say, Meiko quickly outgrew the home and needed to move into a commercial building to support her rapidly growing business.\r\n\r\nToday, One Smart Cookie Company has a total of 11 employees operating three locations and has expanded their product line to include deli sandwiches and catering services.

There is a legend about its culture.  As Peruvians, we are very proud of this city since this is where the Nazca lines are found.  They were drawn in a big field and were used by the Nasca culture for farming since they were a type of calendar where the people could figure out when the rainy season would be.  Because of these majestic lines many many tourists come. \r\n\r\n Francisca is a woman who struggles.  She is a single mother and as with all Peruvian women, she strives for her children (23, 18 and 17).  The three are studying at the university.  Francisca tells us that she wants her children to be better educated and especially because their studies are the best inheritance that she can leave for them.\r\n\r\nBefore Francisca had her business she used to wash laundry in different houses.  It was very hard work but she was able to save from what she earned and so have her work that she has now, selling bread on her tricycle on the streets of the city where she lives.  Francisca rises very early to do her work, from 4:00 am she is already working so that she can sell all of her product.  She can earn up to .50 sols weekly but on a good day, she can earn up to 100 sols.  She believes that she is doing well because she sells quality bread, she is very friendly, and because God guides her in her work.\r\n\r\nNow Francisca is very thankful for the Kiva loan since she would like to have their support to buy a tricycle.  With this improvement she could do better work since she needs to have some new equipment to be able to go to more places to sell the bread.  This way she could save money to fulfill her biggest dream: \u201cHer children would become professionals\u201d.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":23.58,"image":{"id":970351,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy a tricycle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Nazca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2011-12-31T01:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Francisca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.89},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.82},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.21},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.3},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.36},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.49},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.02},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.55},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.76},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.07},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.34},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103.19}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.58},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.56},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.71},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.23},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.01},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.51},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.83},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.41},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.65},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.25},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.7}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":23.58,"local_amount":62.89,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:45:57Z","rounded_local_amount":63.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257142577,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-02T13:34:47Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":377221,"name":"Rosa Narciza","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Rosa Narcisa  tiene 50 a\u00f1os de edad, ella vive en Ica, Per\u00fa.

Together they have 2 children, aged 24 and 19, whom they are helping to get ahead with great effort and sacrifice: both are studying at the university. \r\n\r\nRosa works selling beverages (soft drinks, water, etc.). She dedicates herself to this work for 6 hours each day. Her father inspired her to go into this type of business. In one day, Rosa can serve approximately 15 to 20 customers, and this allows her to earn some 90 Peruvian soles per day; on a good day she can earn up to 660 soles. This helps her take care of some extra household expenses and also invest in her business. She believes that her business is going well for her thanks to the good treatment she gives her customers as well as her friendly personality. \r\n\r\nShe is very grateful to the Kiva lenders, since with the help provided to her she will be able to buy merchandise for her business. This improvement will help her offer a greater variety of products and earn a better income. Thus, in a few months, she will be able to save up enough to fulfill her great dream: opening her own store."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":131.65,"image":{"id":970361,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","use":"to buy merchandise.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ica","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2011-12-31T01:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":950,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa Narciza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":168.75},{"due_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":177.69},{"due_date":"2012-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":183.98},{"due_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":188.13},{"due_date":"2012-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":197.17},{"due_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":202.25},{"due_date":"2012-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":211.32},{"due_date":"2012-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":217.39},{"due_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":225.35},{"due_date":"2012-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":234.48},{"due_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":242.19},{"due_date":"2012-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":251.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.13},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.52},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.91},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.49},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.92},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.86},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.3},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.61},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.63},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.1},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.04},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.49}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":64.13,"local_amount":168.75,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:45:40Z","rounded_local_amount":172.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257142567,"comment":null},{"amount":67.52,"local_amount":177.69,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:57:05Z","rounded_local_amount":182.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263271162,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-14T01:23:15Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":377222,"name":"Talosaga","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Talosaga is fifty-two years old and is married with two children.\r\n\r\nTalosaga owns and operates a business venture, catching and selling ocean-caught fish.

She is a very hard-working woman who lives in the famous city of Nazca, Peru. This city is famous for the legendary Nazca Lines, a series of ancient, immense and inexplicable hieroglyphics carved into the desert which surrounds the city. They are generally attributed to the people of the Nazca culture, who inhabited the region from 300 to 800 AD. Because of this, the city attracts a large number of tourists. However, Nazca is also known for its hard-working people, who have survived in spite of frequent earthquakes, tsunamis, and a high poverty rate in the region. Marleny is a mother with 4 children, aged 17, 15, 12 and 3. The three older children are currently in secondary school, and the youngest does not go to school yet, but he is very mischievous; she says that \"le saca canas verdes\" [he gives her green hairs instead of gray hairs].\r\n\r\nMarleny is currently running a business selling breakfasts, beverages and raspadillas (shaved ice with added sweet fruit-based syrups). She works at her business 8 hours each day, and in one day she might make 50 Peruvian soles, or on a very good day up to 100 soles. She was inspired to open this type of business because she wanted to work at home, so she could watch over her children, especially the youngest. \r\n\r\nMarleny is very grateful for the support provided by the Kiva lenders, since thanks to this help, she will be able to buy supplies (groceries, vegetables, etc.) to expand her business by offering food in the evenings. With this improvement, she will be able to obtain a better income, offer a greater variety of products, and attract more customers. With this she will have better earnings and be able to save up to fulfill her great dream: having her own restaurant. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":23.8,"image":{"id":970372,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"to buy supplies (groceries, vegetables).","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Nazca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2011-12-31T01:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marleny ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.47},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.37},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.78},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.83},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.88},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.97},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.49},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.99},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.15},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.44},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.66},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.97}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.8},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.77},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.91},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.44},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.2},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.74},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.69},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.99},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.56},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.79},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.37},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.74}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":23.8,"local_amount":63.47,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:57:23Z","rounded_local_amount":64.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263271163,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-12-31T09:46:47Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":377224,"name":"Taufau","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Taufau is fifty-nine years old and is married with five children.\r\n\r\nTaufau Mua owns and operates a business venture, planting and harvesting taro for sale.

is Delia, 51, a resident of Tanza, Cavite City, Philippines. Her husband is Armando, a contractor and father to her children. Delia, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nDelia operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which sells groceries, toiletries, and beverages to residents of the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy a packet of shampoo, a few pesos' worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns a profit by getting her inventory at wholesale prices and then retailing them by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and members of the local community. She earns a minimum of 350 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue her business operations, she is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages, and other products she sells in her business. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nDelia hopes her business will grow into a mini-grocery.

The city, along with others near the Pacific coast, was damaged in the 2001 and 2007 earthquakes in Peru, but has born up as it has throughout most of its history. Karina has studied through the eleventh grade. Since her parents did not have enough economic resources to pay for her studies, she was not able to continue on to study the field of law. \r\n\r\nKarina lives in her parents' home, whom she supports with the fruits of her labor since she tells us that they, in spite of their few resources, have helped her greatly. Karina devotes herself to the business of selling groceries in her neighborhood market, which she has done for seven months now, devoting much effort to getting ahead. She works about eight hours a day and may serve up to 25 customers a day. She believes it is going well  in her business because she provides good customer service since she likes for the customers to return and recommend her to others. \r\n\r\nCurrently she is very grateful to the Kiva lenders since with the help provided she will be able to purchase more merchandise for her business. With this improvement she will be able to have more variety in the products she sells and thus obtain a better income in order to continue saving. She hopes to expand her business and achieve her greatest dream: \"To continue her advanced studies.\"\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":168.44,"image":{"id":971966,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase merchandise for her grocery store.

She began by selling clothes and gradually added shoes, school supplies, small household electrical items and whatever product is ordered. The majority of her clients are bus drivers on the road from the city of Barranquilla to Puerto Colombia, a municipality found at the mouth of the sea. This is her main client\u00e8le, because her husband is also a bus driver, and they pay her daily in agreed amounts for no more than 60 days. \r\n\r\nShe sells a variety of products, from a pair of shoes to wheels for buses. In addition, she also has a kiosk at the entrance to the bus station, where she sells soft drinks and tasty snacks. \r\n\r\nCurrently, she plans to respond to her client in the season of the greatest amount of commercial movement of the year, by being well stocked with merchandise.

Through his dedicated work as a farmer, he has been able to raise his family, and provide a decent education to his three children, whom he really loves, and for whom he works. \r\n\r\nSince he was a child, he learned to work the land, and sell the products that nature grants him. In the hills near his community he has three parcels of agricultural land, on which he grows coffee. \r\n\r\n\"The harvest is good in May and June because the price of coffee goes up to 14 soles a can,\" he says. Alfonso is happy about his results. From the three parcels he gets around 15 sacks of coffee, each one approximately 60 kilos. \r\n\r\nAt the same time he has a small business selling foodstuffs and candy set up in his house. There, Rosa is responsible for serving the customers, while she prepares food for her children. This is a close-knit family. In spite of the many household chores, Rosa and Alfonso take turns working the land, as it needs constant care.\r\n\r\nAlfonso wants to expand his business into a small store where he will sell groceries and basic staples. This would be the first loan that Alfonso would obtain from MFP. He feels excited about that. Now he is part of the \"Los Claveles de Pachacutec\" communal bank, which he is hopeful about. \r\n\r\nWhen he gets the loan, he will be able to buy five bags of organic fertilizer with 600 soles.

Chhin, 47, is in this photo in front of her house in Kompong Cham province. She is a loving mother of four children and a single parent who is engaged in the agricultural business. Besides farming within the rainy season, Mrs. Chhin also works at home as a hammock weaver to generate additional income of $1.50 per day. Presently, two of her children are apprentice goldsmiths who now are training in one of the province markets, and they\u2019ll finish their class soon.
