He manages his business from his own stall at the main bus depot in Sikasso with a clientele made up of travelers and most of all transporters.  He is sought out by these clients for the quality of his products.\r\n\r\nWith the goal of better satisfying his growing clientele, he decided to join the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso.  It had been one year and he has already profited from two loans both of which he repaid fully and on time.  Now he is asking for a third loan to purchase boxes of batteries, 8 dozen headsets of different types, one dozen mounts and belts from Bamako.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, he hopes to earn a monthly profit of 300,000 FCFA which will be used to contribute to family expenses, to pay the interest on his loan, and to invest the remainder into his business.

He has been operating this business for the past 15 years and has a good reputation among his clients due to his fresh quality and tasty sweetmeats. \r\n \r\nUzma is hopeful that an investment will put her husband\u2019s business in a more profitable position and increase his profits. \r\nShe lives in Chichawatni, which is a small city in Punjab, Pakistan known for its agriculture industry.  \r\n\r\nNote: In the photo, the lady with a book (called Asasah Passbook) is Uzma. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":246.46,"image":{"id":771443,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"To buy ingredients to make sweetmeat ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PK","country":"Pakistan","town":"Chichawatni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"30.533333 72.7","type":"point"}},"partner_id":60,"posted_date":"2011-05-19T07:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Uzma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Azra Bibi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PKR","disbursal_amount":25000,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2282},{"due_date":"2011-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2282},{"due_date":"2011-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2282},{"due_date":"2011-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2282},{"due_date":"2011-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2282},{"due_date":"2011-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":2282},{"due_date":"2011-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":2282},{"due_date":"2012-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2282},{"due_date":"2012-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2282},{"due_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2282},{"due_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2180}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.38},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.39},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.38},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.39},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.38},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.38},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.39},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.38},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.39},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.38},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":27.38,"local_amount":2282,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:35:37Z","rounded_local_amount":2337.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216452936,"comment":null},{"amount":27.39,"local_amount":2282,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:18:36Z","rounded_local_amount":2337.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221616891,"comment":null},{"amount":27.38,"local_amount":2282,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-16T07:54:01Z","rounded_local_amount":2337.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":226986020,"comment":null},{"amount":27.39,"local_amount":2282,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:21:00Z","rounded_local_amount":2337.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232744865,"comment":null},{"amount":27.38,"local_amount":2282,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:23:42Z","rounded_local_amount":2337.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238549350,"comment":null},{"amount":27.38,"local_amount":2282,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:17:12Z","rounded_local_amount":2337.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244508147,"comment":null},{"amount":27.39,"local_amount":2282,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:20:43Z","rounded_local_amount":2337.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250715823,"comment":null},{"amount":27.38,"local_amount":2282,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:35:04Z","rounded_local_amount":2337.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257118724,"comment":null},{"amount":27.39,"local_amount":2282,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:36:01Z","rounded_local_amount":2337.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263243760,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-05-19T14:25:25Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":299161,"name":"Baasansuren","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Baasansuren, 48, is married and lives with her husband and son in a ger, Mongolian yurt, in Hovd province, Mongolia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

is a small business entrepreneur. He owns a grocery store and has much experience working in this sphere of trade. His business is known for its reasonable pricing policy and free delivery service. \r\n\r\nDavlatbek is always on the go. He is very determined and knows how to achieve his goals.   Davlatbek is seeking a loan of 6800 Somoni to purchase foodstuffs to expand his inventory. He is hoping to use the generated profit to finish remodeling his apartment, which he has not been able to complete due to financial constraints. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

is married with 4 children. She sells kid's clothing at the central market and has been in this business for 8 years. Her extensive experience helps Mavluda to choose the right kind of inventory and make good sales. Mavluda enjoys selling clothing; moreover, this business brings her stable income. \r\n\r\nMavluda would like to borrow 3,000 USD to purchase a summer collection of kid's clothing. She has used IMON International\u2019s loans before and considers them to be very helpful for her business. \r\n\r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

The green fields of the community of Chichubamba, located in Valle Sagrado de los Incas, is where Martha currently lives and in life it has been a most pleasant place for her to work. \r\n\r\nWhen she was very young her parents taught her this business and today she has her own fields where she works together with her partner. With a great deal of care they cultivate flowers, such as roses, chrysanthemums, carnations, and other flowers. what she most enjoys about her work is to harvest the fields because this is when she feels that her arduous work has been a great investment. She has been in the business for several years and she considers the most difficult part to be the transportation of the harvest to the collection centers in the cities of Urubamba and Cusco. Martha requests a loan to carry out one of her plans, which is to extend her flower plantation because her plants obtain the best price in the market. With time she hopes to save enough money to start a lumber yard. She has the obligation to make her payments on time and she is ready to do so if she wants to have another loan. She is thankful to the organization for granting her this loan.

He was born in Santander Department and arrived in the city 11 years ago and went into the traditional business of running a general store whose goal is to meet the needs of housewives related to the basic family grocery basket in a site near their homes.\n\nIn his store, Alcides sells foodstuffs, snacks, liquor, groceries, dairy products, meats, candy, soft drinks and beverages that he buys daily, weekly or monthly according to each product\u2019s turnover rate.  His sales are primarily cash and his business takes up almost the entire dwelling which he rents.

woman in the photo is Mrs. Ou, age 50. She lives in the Province of Kompong Tom in Cambodia, where she earns a living raising pigs. Since 2000, she has run this business, and it has provided her with income to get to her standard of living. She is married with eight children, five of whom are single and three are married already. \r\n\r\nHer husband helps her in raising pigs as well as catching fish.
