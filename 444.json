is a single woman with one child who attends school. She has been operating her retail shop for the last six years, selling to her immediate neighbors and passersby. She has no other source of income. With the 40,000 Kenyan shillings loan, she wants to purchase a bundle of maize flour, wheat flour, a sack of sugar and a bundle of bathing soaps.\r\n\r\nMarata faces the major challenge of seasonality in her business.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

When she received a small amount of capital from ASHI, she managed to put it all into her business. For her, business is an important factor, and she does not want to be a problem for her group mates with the weekly loan obligations.\r\n\r\nShe applied for a new loan amounting PHP 20,000.00 to have additional working capital for her business. Specifically, the loan fund will be use to purchase inventory of bamboo crafts and charcoal to sell.\r\n\r\nLorenda is a very good member of ASHI. She performs well in her business. When she has enough capital, she increases her business in order to gain more income. She hopes that through her loans availed in the ASHI partnership with KIVA; someday she will be able to save money as she is getting older. Along with the business success she is dreaming about, is the hope to see the graduation of her children at college and to see them find stable jobs.

Moreover, he wanted to manage his own business early on. Of course, owning a successful coffee business came through much sacrifice. He is grateful to his parents for teaching him good life lessons that have encouraged him to keep improving his agricultural business year after year.

At harvest time he hires labourers to pick the crops, which are later sold at local collection centres.<br>\r\nHis plan for the future is to keep investing in his farming business, buying new land to increase his production. This is his fifth MFP loan, which he is committed to repaying on time. He\u2019s very satisfied with his communal group since it allows him to improve his business.

Together, they live in the community of Villa Quintiarina, in the beautiful forests of the Cusco area, where they have their own house made of wood. The key to Blas' success lies in the creativity and honesty he displays with all of his customers. For this reason, his product, cacao [cocoa], is purchased at a good price in his valley. In addition, his buyers are satisfied with the quality of the product he offers them, and thanks to this, he earns a good income. He normally works on his own, but he sometimes receives help from his wife and his children. However, during the harvest season, he assigns work to laborers, who facilitate the harvest and sorting of the cacao, which will be sold to the wholesale centers in his community. His plan for the future is to keep expanding his agricultural production so that he can continue to satisfy his customers and thus improve his standard of living. This is his fifth loan with MFP, and he promises to faithfully comply with his payment obligations. He is likewise committed to his communal bank. With the loan he is requesting, he will invest in buying agricultural land, so that he can continue his focus on agricultural work and at the same time start producing on a larger scale. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":583627,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Buying land to increase his cacao production","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-08-15T20:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Blas ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":900}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":900,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:31:55Z","rounded_local_amount":2523.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206195481,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-08-16T01:01:01Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T11:31:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":222667,"name":"Mercy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mercy K. is married and has two children.

Cirilo knows that quality and a commitment to customer service are important factors for his business. Because of this, he has loyal clients that shop at his bakery frequently. He usually works with his wife, but during vacations, his children also help. His bakery is located near the main square in his community. His daily routine begins at 5 in the morning and ends at 9 at night. His dream is to own a bookstore to enable him to diversify his clientele and increase his income. This is Cirilo\u2019s fifth loan with MFP, and he is committed to continuing to make his repayments on time. He is satisfied with his community bank because of their favorable policies. With this loan, Cirilo plans to invest in the purchase of raw materials and ingredients to make bread. He will also invest the loan to stock his business with other products. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Avni Shah, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":583632,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","use":"To buy supplies and ingredients to make break and other products for his bakery ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-08-15T21:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cirilo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1075}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1075,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:32:18Z","rounded_local_amount":3014.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206195482,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-08-16T16:46:57Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T11:32:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":222673,"name":"Theresah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Theresah N. sells maize at Takoradi.

The family lives together in the beautiful jungle near Cusco, located at the top of the Peruvian jungle zone.   They have their own home there made from adobe.  Initially, the agricultural business that Julio had wasn't bringing in enough money.  However, after some time he was able to turn things around.  Today, the largest wholesalers ask for the cocoa he grows due to the quality he offers, and this has enabled Julio to earn the income he needs to support his family.   He runs his small business and cultivates his cocoa crops together with his wife, but during harvest time he needs to hire additional laborers.   Julio usually sells his cocoa in the central markets of his community, and his daily routine is to work from 7 in the morning until 6 in the evening.    His future plans include opening his own shop to generate more income.   This will be Julio's third loan with MFP, and he commits to continue making his payments on time.   He also emphasizes the good work that the communal bank does.  With the loan he is requesting, Julio will purchase supplies and fertilizer needed to give his cocoa crops adequate care.  \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Emily Charnes, Kiva

In the photo, Paula is in the second row, second from left to right, and is wearing a red jacket. \r\n\r\nPaola sells women's clothing and accessories. The accessories she offers include purses, belts, handkerchiefs, scarves, necklaces and rings. Paula sells from her home and in the business establishments of some of her clients: a clinic, a municipality, an institute of social preservation, and three hair salons. \r\n\r\nWith this loan Paola intends to purchase seasonal clothing so her inventory is up-to-date.  Paola travels two times a month to purchase merchandise in Santiago (capital of Chile).  She dreams of having a boutique, ideally in her house so she can look after her children. She has three daughters, two-year-old twins and a 14-year-old daughter.  Paola also works at a supermarket stocking shelves, but she is unable to maintain a fixed schedule for this work as the health of one of her twins requires regular visits to the clinic. \r\n\r\nFondo Esperanza is an important contributor to Paola's business and family, because as an independent business owner she can manage her time in ways that allows her to better accommodate the daily needs of her family. Paula also values the support and encouragement she receives from the loan officer and her fellow group members. The businesses of the other group members include the production and sales of empanadas, fast-food, salads, chocolates, home d\u00e9cor (bed sheets, curtains, table cloths, etc.), sale of coal, underwear, jewellery, clothing, and a blend of crafted accessories. \r\n \r\nTalca is in the Maule region, in the central part of the country.  The majority of the population lives in the rural area, and is dedicated primarily to activities related to rural production. Talca is also known for its beautiful colonial architecture and artisan goods. The area's main attractions are the flora, the fauna, and the vineyards. Despite the fact that the workforce and production in Talca has increased, according to the recent census, this area is still, unfortunately, one of the poorest in Chile.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3325,"image":{"id":583035,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To purchase clothing inventory for spring and summer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CL","country":"Chile","town":"Talca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-30 -71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":157,"posted_date":"2010-08-16T16:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Paola","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luciano ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isabel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alejandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Claudia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carolina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marcela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Karem","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Grabriela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marlene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CLP","disbursal_amount":1688197,"loan_amount":3325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":94794},{"due_date":"2010-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":101571},{"due_date":"2010-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":102216},{"due_date":"2010-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":102874},{"due_date":"2010-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":103529},{"due_date":"2010-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":104189},{"due_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":104857},{"due_date":"2010-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":105530},{"due_date":"2010-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":106205},{"due_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":106183},{"due_date":"2010-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":108161},{"due_date":"2010-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":108256},{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":108546},{"due_date":"2010-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":109939},{"due_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":110342},{"due_date":"2010-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":111005}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":186.7},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200.05},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":201.32},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":202.62},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":203.9},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205.21},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":206.52},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":207.85},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":209.18},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":209.13},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":213.03},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":213.22},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":213.78},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":216.53},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":217.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":218.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":790.69,"local_amount":401455,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:11:20Z","rounded_local_amount":403053.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166844784,"comment":null},{"amount":823.48,"local_amount":418105,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:04:04Z","rounded_local_amount":419769.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172110960,"comment":null},{"amount":844.56,"local_amount":428805,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:51:24Z","rounded_local_amount":430512.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177404219,"comment":null},{"amount":866.27,"local_amount":439832,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:00:35Z","rounded_local_amount":441583.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182542651,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-08-16T21:36:56Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T14:00:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":222710,"name":"Pilar Del Socorro","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"PILAR DEL SOCORRO J.

They live in the community of Villa Quintiarina, located in the Peruvian tropical jungle, in their own adobe home.  Business-wise, she dedicates herself the selling of cacao, both in her own community as well as in other localities.\r\n\r\nShe is very content with her work, and for everything that she has managed to achieve to date.  In addition, her sales have increased when compared to previous years.  She usually works alongside her husband and, together, they make a good team.  During vacations, she gets help from her children.  During harvest time, however, she has laborers that help her extract and transport her final product to the supply centers so it can be sold.\r\n\r\nHer plan for the future is to open a store, with the aim of diversifying her customer base to further improve her standard of living.  This is her seventh credit with MFP, and she assures us she plans to faithfully comply with her payments.  In addition, she is satisfied with her cooperative bank as it provides her with many benefits.  \r\n\r\nShe plans to use the loan to invest in the educations of four children, and the rest will be used to improve her home. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":583754,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","use":"For the educational expenses of her children.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-08-18T10:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eugenia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1075}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1075,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:31:39Z","rounded_local_amount":3014.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206195493,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-08-18T14:19:41Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T11:31:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":222747,"name":"Silvio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Se\u00f1or Silvio C. de 32 a\u00f1os de edad trabaja como Vendedor Ambulante, el misma cuenta con un puesto de ventas al costado de la terminal de Villarrica.\nSu c\u00f3nyuge Crispina Almada de 27 a\u00f1os de edad es comerciante, se dedica a la venta de frutas y verduras por la zona de Villarrica, ambos solicitaron dicho pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de mercader\u00edas para el negocio (compra de frutas y verduras), ya que los mismos manifestaron que hay mucha venta y necesitan de capital para m\u00e1s mercader\u00edas.\n","en":"Silvio C. is 32 years old and works as a street vendor, with a stall next to the Villarrica terminal.  \r\n\r\nHis wife, Crispina Almada, is 27 years old and a merchant.

She has raised cows and bulls for over 10 years.  Every day she extracts milk to sell to her neighbors or to firms that make cheese.  Additionally, she strives to feed her bulls well and after a period of three months sells them at a price higher than the original price she paid for them or she uses them for plowing the fields.\r\n\r\nSometimes her children help her with the chores; they cut the grass and feed the cattle or sell the milk.   What she enjoys most about her work is that she can manage her time to tend to her family and that it is independent, profitable work.  Because of this, she wishes to increase her herd size in order to increase milk production.\r\n\r\nThis is her 5th loan with MFP.  She is happy to know that she can count on financial support because she has always been responsible with her repayments.  In addition, she is glad to be part of a communal bank because all of its members are responsible and very mutually supportive people.\r\n\r\nShe is grateful to all those people who will fund the loan she is requesting for it will be very useful for her business.\r\n\r\nShe will use the requested funds to buy nutritionally balanced feed for her animals and to buy a young calf.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":583766,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy nutritionally balanced feed for her animals and to buy a calf.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-08-16T19:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":725,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:38:08Z","rounded_local_amount":2032.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201326889,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-08-16T21:43:43Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T11:38:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":222755,"name":"Juana Francisca","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Juana Francisca tiene 60 a\u00f1os, Ella se dedica a la venta de ropa y granos b\u00e1sicos.

Her greatest talent, however,  is clothes-making but, the lack of funds to launch this potential, caused her to lean toward merchandise sales since working with middlemen on credit was a possibility.  \r\n\r\nThis is how she started with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo over 10 years ago when she would go to Maicao.

It belongs to the province of Lambayeque and is located 40 minutes from the city of Chiclayo.\n\nShe runs a small business out of her house, selling animals that she raises herself (sheep, pigs, and caged birds).

This business provides her with the necessary income to take care of her aging parents.\n\nHer business has been prospering and she now has a good number of sheep, but her earnings are not enough to feed them.  This is why she is requesting a loan from Edpyme Alternativa.  She is requesting a loan of 1,500 soles, which she will invest in the purchase of feed for her animals.\n\nShe hopes that her business will continue to grow, and would like to start a small farm to offer her and her family a better quality of life.

She is a refugee from Fuzuli and now lives in the Fuzuli region.  She is unmarried and lives alone.\r\n\r\nFor five years, Khanim A. has been selling cheese, milk, greens, vegetables, and fruit.  Khanim now needs 2000 AZN to buy produce for resale.  Earlier, Khanim had her own cow, and from its milk she made cheese and sold it.  However, she no longer has time for that, and therefore she decided to open a store and work there. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Melissa Kniazeva, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2500,"image":{"id":583942,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Buying produce","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AZ","country":"Azerbaijan","town":"Fuzuli region","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"40.5 47.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":30,"posted_date":"2010-08-14T16:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Khanim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"AZN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":2500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2011-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2011-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2011-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2011-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2011-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2011-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2011-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2011-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2012-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":250,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:28:15Z","rounded_local_amount":200.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206189020,"comment":null},{"amount":250,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:37:37Z","rounded_local_amount":200.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211262585,"comment":null},{"amount":250,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:26:24Z","rounded_local_amount":200.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216542524,"comment":null},{"amount":250,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:08:15Z","rounded_local_amount":200.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221711041,"comment":null},{"amount":250,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T09:48:15Z","rounded_local_amount":200.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227081409,"comment":null},{"amount":250,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:39:30Z","rounded_local_amount":200.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232843081,"comment":null},{"amount":250,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:46:02Z","rounded_local_amount":200.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238655115,"comment":null},{"amount":250,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:30:32Z","rounded_local_amount":200.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244609165,"comment":null},{"amount":250,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:37:47Z","rounded_local_amount":200.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250824187,"comment":null},{"amount":250,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-16T09:31:40Z","rounded_local_amount":200.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257234344,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-08-15T17:53:18Z","paid_date":"2012-02-16T09:31:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":222818,"name":"Nelia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nelia P. is from the village of Luna. She is 48 years-old and married with two school-aged children. To make a living, Nelia owns and operates a business providing motorcycle transport services. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income comes from operating tricycle transport services. Nelia has been engaged in her business for over ten years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Nelia joined Kiva partner ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Nelia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to repair her existing vehicle to provide better service. Nelia is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to purchase tires and other accessories. This loan will be the tenth loan taken out by Nelia from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to pay the tuition fees of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fishers and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

However, in the future he hopes to have five quality dairy cows which will earn him a daily income of 10,000 Kenyan Shillings and enable him to service a loan of more than one million Kenyan Shillings.<p>\r\n\r\nJohn has requested this loan from Juhudi Kilimo of 50,000 Kenyan Shillings to expand his poultry project. He says that the extra income from this loan will enable him pay school fees for his children. He hopes that with the decrease in lending rates by the Central Bank, Juhudi will look at their interest rate."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":584075,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To expand his poultry project.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.016667 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2010-08-16T19:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"John","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":50000,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2010-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2010-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2010-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2010-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2011-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2011-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2011-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2011-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2011-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":5000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":41.88,"local_amount":3350,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:33:21Z","rounded_local_amount":3354.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166875389,"comment":null},{"amount":65.63,"local_amount":5250,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:19:23Z","rounded_local_amount":5256.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172142440,"comment":null},{"amount":65.63,"local_amount":5250,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:57:12Z","rounded_local_amount":5256.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177437289,"comment":null},{"amount":67.5,"local_amount":5400,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:33:45Z","rounded_local_amount":5406.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182576646,"comment":null},{"amount":96.88,"local_amount":7750,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:47:59Z","rounded_local_amount":7759.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188712393,"comment":null},{"amount":45,"local_amount":3600,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:18:35Z","rounded_local_amount":3604.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191450184,"comment":null},{"amount":116.88,"local_amount":9350,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:57:54Z","rounded_local_amount":9361.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195872284,"comment":null},{"amount":0.6,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-21T08:08:57Z","rounded_local_amount":50.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":202030158,"comment":null},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-19T07:54:13Z","rounded_local_amount":5006.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206668224,"comment":null},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-16T08:12:01Z","rounded_local_amount":5006.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211446766,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-08-17T00:06:11Z","paid_date":"2011-06-16T08:12:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":222858,"name":"Hellen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hellen has been operating her mixed farm for the last three years in the town of Kitale in Western Kenya.

She moves responsibly through her duties as mother and wife, as well as her personal commitment to create income through her business as a saleswoman and manicurist.\r\n\r\nIn 2002, she came to Baranquilla from Banco, in the department of Magdalena.  She started her business when, after taking a beauty course and already working as a manicurist, her expenses went up.  A customer suggested that she go into catalog sales.  From the moment that she decided to do so, she started gaining customers and she has not stopped since because it's gone very well.\r\n\r\nThis is her second loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  With her first loan, she noted that her income increased and she decided that she should seek financing in the seasons of higher sales, which she is is doing right now with her \"credikiva,\" or Kiva loan.  Getting this loan will help her to prepare for the second part of the year, a period when she moves more merchandise as the end-of-year holidays approach and people receive premiums and bonuses.  Her customers take advantage of this to buy the products that only Ana sells.\r\n\r\nShe will invest this \"credikiva\" in makeup and perfume products, creams and accessories, blouses, pants, and supplies for her manicure business, such as polishes and artificial fingernails.\r\n\r\nAna Yolima will prepare for this busy period and she will most surely do so with persistence, because she wants to achieve her dream of having a sales counter in a general store, and her greatest dream is to acquire her own house.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Katie Kavanagh, Kiva

Details concerning their different activities follow:\r\n\r\nGloria sells sweets from her store, located in her home. She has done this for more than 2 years. The business generates income and she has a very reliable client\u00e8le, since she is at a strategic location, on one of the most frequented routes of the municipality of Las Trojes. Gloria is the mother of 2 school-age children who study at the local primary school. Her husband raises cattle and the zone is very apt for that activity. In this form, they mutually contribute to the home. Gloria's loan will be used to buy primary materials to make her sweets and thus, to satisfy client demands.\r\n\r\nReina is a merchant, selling milk products for more than a year from her store, located in her home. She sells both wholesale and retail. Generally, Saturdays are the best day for sales. She buys her milk products from vendors who come from dairies in this sector that will generate her greatest profits. Reina's loan will be used to buy more products, since she lacks sufficient capital to satisfy customer demand. Her loan will be used to buy merchandise for her general store.\r\n\r\nDilcia is a merchant with a general store that sells ice cream (in cones), located in her home in Barrio El Jazm\u00edn, municipality of Las Trojes, for more than 8 years.

They have to take it to another community, which is five kilometers away.\r\n\r\nLuvy lives in Malpaisillo in a community called Calle Real de Tolapa.  But, she has been selling curd in the Chichigalpa municipal market for 12 years.  She travels everyday with her curd and cream business.  She tells us that it has been a good spot for sales.  This is because she has gotten customers, and because her curd is recognized as being of quality.\r\n\r\nThe 27 loans that Ceprodel has facilitated have been for her business.  This last one that she requested was to buy and fix a truck.  They will use the truck to transport the milk.  The one that they currently have is very low, and it is not for use on the terrain they use to transport the milk.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

D. is from the town of San Pablo. He is 41 years old. Joseph is married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Joseph raises livestock. The main source of income for the business comes from raising pigs for fattening and sale. Joseph has been engaged in his business for over 12 years and earns approximately 4,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) whenever he sells an animal he has raised.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Joseph joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Joseph has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from ASKI. Joseph is requesting a new loan of 12,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future. This will be the third loan taken out by Joseph from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of his family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

Their three children are all in school: with one in college, another in high school, and the youngest in elementary.\r\n\r\nNerissa finished midwifery but chose to do a business related to transportation. They presently own vehicles which are for hire, mainly by companies. Nerissa also has a small business in rag-making. Altogether, the net earnings of the family per month amount to P11,960. \r\n\r\nNerissa is applying for a loan of P12,000, which she plans to use to register two of her vehicles to be officially used in business. She would also use the loan to improve the conditions of the vehicles by changing the color and adding some accessories.\r\n\r\nAt present, Nerissa finds the daily collections from the business difficult. Sometimes, the vehicles are penalized for violation, which adds up expenses. At times, the vehicles get damaged and need repairs. However, Nerissa still hopes and believes that God has destined her for a greater purpose. She dreams to own a bigger business with more vehicles that would cater to many more companies in Metro Manila and beyond. She also hopes that her rag-making business will increase in sales. She aims for these breakthroughs in business because, at the bottom line, she aspires to buy her family their own house and lot.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

M. is from the village of Calamagui, San Pablo. She is 42 years old. Cherisa is married and has four school-aged children. To make a living, Cherisa sells vegetables in the local community. Cherisa has been engaged in her business for over 15 years and earns approximately 6,000 Philippines pesos (PHP) a month from it.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Cherisa joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Cherisa has successfully repaid a previous loan of 12,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. \r\n\r\nCherisa is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be the fourth loan taken out by Cherisa from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to save as a reserve for future emergencies.\r\n\r\n<b>About ASKI:<\/b>\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

attained a college education, Necitas C., 37, wants to achieve more in life, not just for herself but for her family as well. Necitas lives in Pasay City with her husband, Larry C., who is a tricycle operator. They have four children, one of whom is in college while another is in high school.\r\n\r\nNess (as she is fondly called by her friends) presently owns an electronic-loading station for mobile phones and a direct-selling business which caters mainly to people near their residence in Pasay City. E-loading and direct selling of beauty products and other items depends largely on Ness\u2019 perseverance and social connections. Ness and Larry gather a net income of 10,910 Philippine pesos monthly, which they use to meet the needs of the entire family.\r\n\r\nNess admits that she needs a 20,000 pesos loan to enhance her business and increase her profits. She applied to CCT* for this loan, which she plans to use to further her e-loading business as well as her direct-selling business, which includes brands such as Natasha and MSE. She also intends to put up a purified drinking water station with the loan she hopefully will receive from Kiva. Basically, the loan will serve as additional capital that will enable Ness to make her business more profitable and lead to more savings.\r\n\r\nAt present, Ness sees that her business is not that profitable. She also experiences persecution from people who put her down instead of supporting her in achieving a better life for her family. Still, Ness is determined not to be swayed by these struggles and aims to make her business grow. She prays to find a commercial area where her business could thrive and flourish. She also hopes that her business, along with the purified drinking water station which she plans to put up, will expand and become stable.

B. is 19 years old and lives in the town of Kireka in the Kampala East region of Uganda. She is married and has three children, who are all currently in school. Rose has a business running a small hotel, which she has had for less than one year.\r\n<p>\r\nTo help expand her business, Rose has requested a loan of 200,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase more things like cups, saucepans and plates. With the help of the loan from BRAC, Rose hopes to generate greater profits and to provide her children with things like medication, food, and clothing. In the future, Rose hopes to own a house.  \r\n<p>\r\nNote to lenders: BRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product to Kiva which funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills. Afterward, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses. These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance. Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in microfinance.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":584567,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Hotel","sector":"Services","use":"To buy

The dealer\u2019s prices are lower than those in the catalogue, and these are the profits that dealers are investing on as their income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 13,000 in sales every month. Jo-Ane also incorporates frozen cuts of meat and native meat delicacies to her current business inventory. She offers sweetened hams, pork sausages and cured beef.\r\n<p>\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 29,000 loan.

This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan.  Initially, the ELA program provides disadvantaged adolescents, particularly girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills.  Afterwards, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses.  These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age, improve their prospects for the future and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance.  Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and to give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in microfinance.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":584570,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"To

As rugs are a major part of Filipino housekeeping and cleaning, rugs are one of the most common products that can be bought. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php200 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php8,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of raw materials, including fabric, thread, and newspapers for patterns. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nNorma dreams of giving her children a high quality education through all her hard work with her business. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":584581,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","use":"Buy more quantities of raw materials such as fabric, thread, and newspapers for patterns","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Dasmarinas, Cavite","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2010-08-17T20:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Norma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":533.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2666.65,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:56:59Z","rounded_local_amount":3033.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166821742,"comment":null},{"amount":53.33,"local_amount":2133.32,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:53:07Z","rounded_local_amount":2426.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172088986,"comment":null},{"amount":53.33,"local_amount":2133.32,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:20:37Z","rounded_local_amount":2426.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177380352,"comment":null},{"amount":26.67,"local_amount":1066.71,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-16T11:02:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1213.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182816694,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-08-17T20:19:44Z","paid_date":"2010-12-16T11:02:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":223029,"name":"Margret","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Margret N. is 21 years-old and lives in the town of Kireka in the Kampala East region of Uganda.

This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan.  Initially, the ELA program provides disadvantaged adolescents, in particular girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills.  Afterwards, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses.  These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age, improve their prospects for the future and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance.  Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and in giving Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in microfinance.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":584582,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty

A. is from the town of Roxas Cordon Isabela. She is 29 years \u2013old and married with two school-aged children. To make a living, Jona owns and operates a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Jona has been engaged in her business for over four years and earns approximately 8,200 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Jona joined Kiva partner ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Jona has successfully repaid a previous loan of 15,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell.  Jona is requesting a new loan of 40,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Jona from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.
