This young couple is very hard working.   I Gusti Ayu Putu Kurniati's husband works as a security guard for a private company.  As soon as Gusti Kurniati heard about the opportunity to receive a business loan to grow her pig farming business, she applied for a loan of 5,000,000 Rupiah.  In her business she has raised 10 fattened pigs.  2,500,000 Rupiah of the loan would be used to purchase a boar.  The pig pen she uses is not permanent.  It is made of bamboo with a roof made of palm leaves. and is not a good place to raise young pigs.  Every day Gusti Kurniati is very busy with all of the work involved in raising her pigs from cleaning their pen to bringing them food.  She says the target age for fattening and selling her pigs is four months.  She estimates that it costs her 5,000,000 Rupiah to feed and care for a pig until it is 4 months old and ready to sell.  Unfortunately, the cost of pig feed has gone up.  She makes approximately 10,000,000 selling a pig and after paying for a boar and the pig feed she has about 2,500,000 every 4 months.

Mendengar ada pinjaman dana dari Dinari yang ditujukan untuk usaha, Gusti Kurniati langsung bergabung dan mendapat pinjaman dana sebesar Rp.5.000.000,-. Gusti Kurniati memelihara 10 ekor babi penggemukan. Modal awal untuk bibit menghabiskan Rp.2.500.000.- Walaupun kandangnya tidak permanen, hanya dipagari oleh bambu dan atapnya ditutupi oleh daun kelapa, tidak mengurangi semangat Gusti Kurniati untuk memelihara penggemukan. Setiap hari Gusti Kurniati disibukan dengan mengurus babinya dari mulai membersihkan kandang sampai memberi makan. Gusti Kurniati memiliki target umur 4 bulan harus dijual dengan berat maksimal. Sampai umur 4 bulan biaya pakan diperkirakan akan  menghabiskan Rp.5.000.000,- karena saat ini semua biaya pakan naik. Pendapatan kotor dari penjualan babinya Rp.10.000.000,-. Setelah dipotong biaya bibit dan pakan keuntungan bersihnya Rp.2.500.000.,- per 4 bulan. Dari hasil inilah Gusti Kurniati akan berencana bertahap memperbaiki kandangnya supaya

He needs a loan to help him maintain his cattle breeding business. In the first half of January, cold and dry weather that predominated in Tajikistan seriously harmed Tajik ahriculture and livestock farming. Tajik cattle breeders found themselves in a difficult situation because they didn't have enough cattle food. They only had a half of the needed amounts of hay in their reserves. However, slottering the cattle at that point in time wasn't profitable. To resolve his problem, Halim requested a loan from Miconvest. The loan helped him to restore his cattle food reserves and continue maining his livestock.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Russian by Vasilisa Budnikova, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>

N. is 46 years old and a native to the Quelimane district in the Zambezia province.  As a child Antonio did not have the opportunity to study and only attended school until the 4th grade.  He says he grew up with his mother and stepfather.  At age 15 he affiliated himself with the F.A.L.M. where he stayed for 5 years until he was discharged.  He was living in the province of Maputo at the time and in the same year he returned to Quelimane again and began working in a family carpentry shop with the goal to learn the art.<p>\r\n\r\nHe married a young girl who months later became pregnant and everything in Antonio's life changed.  The cost of living increased so he decided to return to the city of Maputo leaving his wife with her parents.  In Maputo he was able to win a contract to work in South Africa; this in 1986 when the first President of Mozambique, Samora Machel died.  This situation forced the authorities to cancel the contracts with Mozambique emigrants so he ended up working that year in a restaurant in Catembe.<p>\r\n\r\nIn 1994 he changed jobs working as a carpenter in the town of Bela-Vista.  In 1998 he ended his contract and, tired of looking for work, opened a small business producing furniture.  With the difficulty of acquiring wood in the local market he almost gave up on the activity but with access to credit through HLUVUKU he opted to run the business with financing.  With this loan he intends to purchase wood in the city of Maputo.  With his business he can support a family of 8 people and with the savings he is building a home with conventional materials.  He also works with 2 other people who are heads of households.<p><b>Translated from Portuguese by Jared Wandry, Kiva Volunteer<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nAntonio N., de 46 anos de idade ,natural do Distrito de Quelimane, provincia da Zambezia, durante a sua inf\u00e1ncia n\u00e3o teve possibilidade de estudar, tendo frequentado at\u00e9 4\u00aa classe, diz que cresceu com a mae e o padrasto.\r\n\r\nAos 15 anos foi afiliar se as F.A.L.M, onde ficou durante cinco ano dai foi  desmobilizado, dizer que a desmobiliza\u00e7ao ocorreu na provincia de maputo onde ate entao se encontrava e no mesmo ano volta a Quelimane provincia de origem e come\u00e7ou a trabalhar numa carpintaria Familiar com o proposito de aprender a arte.

L. mujer\u201d is a small rural community bank of FINCA Peru\u2019s Wari-project which provides its credit with educational services in the rural areas of Huancavelica. Huancavelica is considered one of the poorest regions of Peru and has many limitations, being a very mountainous area (altituD. ranges from 6,000 \u2013 17,000 ft above sea level). People there also face the cold, the difficulty growing crops, and the lack of an adequate infrastructure of roads and communication systems.\r\n<P>\r\nBCR \u201cAmanecer D. L. mujer\u201d, whose name can be translated as the \u201cAwakening of the Woman\u201d, is located in the community of AntacalL. in the district of Anco, province of Churcampa. The main activities of the population are growing corn (lower altitudes), potatoes and wheat (higher altitudes); raising guinea-pigs, pigs, and chicken, and they also have cows and bulls. The community of AntacalL. faces many difficulties due to its remoteness, lack of public transportation and access to markets. It receives very little in the way of public and social services. <P>\r\n\r\nThe bank has just completed half a year of existence and its first loan-cycle, with currently 11 female borrowers and a total loan of 3,600 soles (about US$ 1,240). The loans range from 100, 200, 400 soles, up to 600 soles. Besides repaying their loans, the group was able to save over 1,500 soles (about US$ 520)  during the first loan-cycle, and they will continue to put asiD. savings in the future.<P>\r\n\r\nDuring their first loan cycle, most members have learned how to do business. Whereas before most of their production was for home consumption, more and more they have learned to be entrepreneurs, to earn a little money with the work they do.  And, sometimes for the first time in their lives, they have learned how to improve the quality of their lives and the importance of saving.\r\n<P>\r\nOne of the members of the community bank is Saturnina Dur\u00e1n Chacasan. Saturnina buys and sells \"tuna\", the fruit of the tuna-cactus. Besides buying the fruit down at the Mantaro river-basin, she grows her own tuna in a small field of tuna-cactuses. She sells her tunas in one of the major cities in the central Peruvian Andes, Huancayo, more than 5 hours away from AntacalL.--at least, when she is lucky enough to find transportation. Her new loan of 500 soles, she will not invest in her tuna-business, however. This time she will buy a cow! Starting a new business! Although the cow will cost her 1,000 soles, she will put in the other half of the price of the cow herself, from her savings. One of the things she learned in FINCA Peru is not to talk badly of other people.<P>\r\n\r\nAnother story is that of Florentina M. Dur\u00e1n, who has her business of baking and selling bread. Like all women in the community bank, she also has her fields with corn and wheat. Most of the production is for home consumption, but fortunately she also is able to sell some of her product. She will invest her 200 soles loan to buy more wheat for her bakery.\r\n<P>\r\nRosa Ana S. D. L. C., who has requested a 400 soles loan, has a small business selling shoes, and Sundays when AntacalL. has its weekly market, she also sells meals. She will invest her loan in buying new shoes for her business. It's a good time for that, because schools are about to start again, and most children need new shoes to go with their school uniforms. And, like most members of her group, her dream is for her family to improve their quality of life and for her four children to study. She will use her savings for buying school necessities because a new school year is starting."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1275,"image":{"id":137343,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"expanding their small businesses or starting up new ones","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2008-03-20T16:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Susana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dionicia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Norberte","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa Ana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mayela Elvira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maribel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florentina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Saturnina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Saturnina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Regina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-04-03T21:11:29Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3600,"loan_amount":1275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2008-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2008-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2008-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2008-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2008-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":212.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":213,"local_amount":601.41,"processed_date":"2008-05-03T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T03:52:47Z","rounded_local_amount":613.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":199956,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":213,"local_amount":601.41,"processed_date":"2008-06-03T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T03:53:45Z","rounded_local_amount":613.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":226957,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":213,"local_amount":601.41,"processed_date":"2008-07-03T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T04:00:29Z","rounded_local_amount":613.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":256202,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":213,"local_amount":601.41,"processed_date":"2008-08-03T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T04:03:08Z","rounded_local_amount":613.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":284933,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":213,"local_amount":601.41,"processed_date":"2008-09-03T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-09T01:56:29Z","rounded_local_amount":613.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315124,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":210,"local_amount":592.94,"processed_date":"2008-10-03T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-10T07:20:18Z","rounded_local_amount":604.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":346665,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2008-03-20T21:11:29Z","paid_date":"2008-10-10T07:20:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":39764,"name":"Mar\u00eda Luisa","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Maria Luisa has 2 kids and her husband works as a printer.

S. is 50 years old and has a professional degree. She is married and a mother of 5 children. Zulfiya works as a nurse in the village's medical facility, earning 60 somoni a month. The main source of income for the family is the fattening of cattle and agriculture. Zulfiya's daughters take care of the animals while her husband and her sons take care of the crops. Since they raise their own feed for cattle, the Samatov family save a lot of money. The feed crops are harvested by Zulfiya's sons. Mrs. S. has been a client with Microinvest since 2007 and she used her first loan to purchase a cow. Now she is planning to use the new loan to purchase several sheep and so increase the number of animals the family owns.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Anya Lyuksyutova, Kiva

Holoboevich S. is 43 years old, has a professional high school degree, is married and has a son.

Gafurovna R. is 38 years old, has a high school diploma, is married and has 3 children. For the last 10 years she has been raising and fattening cattle for sale. Her children help her take care of the animals and this is Malika's sole source of income and main occupation. Her husband works as a mechanic in the kolhoz (farming co-op) and earns a minuscule salary of 10 dollars a month. The family owns a small plot of land where they grow wheat and potatoes, while Malika also owns 30 rams and several heads of cattle. The animals are taken out to pasture by her oldest son and to make the trip easier Malkia used her first loan from Microinvest to buy a horse. She is now planning to use her loan money to increase the number of animals in her herd and so increase the income the family earns from fattening and selling the animals. \r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated

Oluoch.\r\n<p>\r\nThe above founding six members came together on issues and matters affecting their lives. \r\n<p>\r\nThey came together with an aim of assisting each other and also contributing money to pay for members' transport to attend clinical services at Chulaimbo Rural Provincial Health Centre. As time went by the group registered more members and now has 45 members. The members have also been trained by K-MET in Nutrition support, Home Based Care services, and IGAs management. \r\n<p>\r\nThe group is run by executives comprised of the Chairperson, Secretary, Assistant Secretary, Organizing Secretary, and the Treasurer. Members wishing to join the group are required to pay a fee which helps them run the day-to-day affairs of the group. A number of members have well-established income-generating activities such as poultry farming, dairy farming, cereal businesses, vegetable stalls, and community pharmacies. Since HIV\/Aids is a concern in this area and good nutrition has played a major role in HIV\/Aids management, the group through K-MET has applied for US $5000 to enable them purchase Nutriflour in bulk to sell to the locals around and beyond the community. \r\n<p><i>\r\nDisclaimer: Due to recent events in Kenya, the security situation in many communities remains unsettled, affecting many local businesses.

The food is all local: rice, ugali (a hot, sticky dough made from maize flour), and plantain (a cooked savoury banana), all served with beans, vegetables, meat, and a variety of yummy sauces."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":137866,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase additional ingredients, such as rice, oil, beans, and fish, in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-03-09T18:40:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ashura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-03-24T01:47:28Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":400000,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2008-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2008-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2008-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2008-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2008-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2008-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2008-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2008-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":40000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":35,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2008-04-24T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:31:32Z","rounded_local_amount":40864.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":190972,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":35,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2008-05-24T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:33:58Z","rounded_local_amount":40864.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":218536,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":35,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2008-06-24T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:36:53Z","rounded_local_amount":40864.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":247523,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":35,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2008-07-24T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:40:35Z","rounded_local_amount":40864.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276172,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":35,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2008-08-24T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:43:15Z","rounded_local_amount":40864.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":305721,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":35,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2008-09-24T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-27T07:34:27Z","rounded_local_amount":40864.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":336726,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":35,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2008-10-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-11-16T08:55:58Z","rounded_local_amount":40864.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":370842,"comment":"scheduled_repayment (late autopay posting for Sero Lease and Finance Ltd.

You can start with one or two and then either add to them as you go or wait for them to multiple naturally! Secondly, they require little space, so sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. Thirdly, while they are growing they produce eggs, which can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income, or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein.

You can start with one or two and then either add to them as you go or wait for them to multiple naturally! Secondly, they require little space, so sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. Thirdly, while they are growing they produce eggs, which can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income, or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein. I\u2019m sure there are hundreds of other reasons why raising kuku is so popular--maybe they are friendlier than other animals or prettier--but this is all time and space will allow.<\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":137932,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase additional chicks to raise and sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-03-14T10:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-03-28T13:59:07Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2008-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2008-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2008-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2008-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2008-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2008-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2008-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2008-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":30000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":28,"local_amount":30545.45,"processed_date":"2008-04-28T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:31:45Z","rounded_local_amount":32691.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":194055,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":28,"local_amount":30545.45,"processed_date":"2008-05-28T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:34:15Z","rounded_local_amount":32691.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":222053,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":28,"local_amount":30545.45,"processed_date":"2008-06-28T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:37:25Z","rounded_local_amount":32691.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":251285,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":28,"local_amount":30545.45,"processed_date":"2008-07-28T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:41:40Z","rounded_local_amount":32691.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":279950,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":28,"local_amount":30545.45,"processed_date":"2008-08-28T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:43:24Z","rounded_local_amount":32691.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":309539,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":28,"local_amount":30545.45,"processed_date":"2008-09-28T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-11T07:12:55Z","rounded_local_amount":32691.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340680,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":25,"local_amount":27272.73,"processed_date":"2008-10-28T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-11-16T08:57:16Z","rounded_local_amount":29188.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372994,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":27,"local_amount":29454.57,"processed_date":"2008-11-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T03:19:10Z","rounded_local_amount":31523.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347536,"comment":null},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2008-12-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-17T09:14:40Z","rounded_local_amount":32107.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970156,"comment":null},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-01-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:16:26Z","rounded_local_amount":32107.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886406,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-03-14T13:59:07Z","paid_date":"2009-02-15T15:16:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":40062,"name":"Patricia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p>Mambo from Dar es Salaam, Tanzania!
