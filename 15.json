Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, which provide the rural poor throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these groups are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional associations from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities.

name is Florentina Maria M., and I am a native of Bela-Vista in the district of Matutuine. I am 41 years old, a married mother of two, and a daughter of a polygamous father. I grew up in a large family with nearly 22 siblings; thus, obtaining an education was difficult. For survival, I learned how to fish at a young age, and, because of my talent for sewing, my father decided to enroll me in a sewing school at the age of 18. To purchase sewing materials, I would sell horticultures. At the end of my sewing courses I worked as a waitress in a tavern because of my lack of experience. After a year, I acquired a sewing machine and began to work from home. Right now I have 4 sewing machines, one machine to make buttonholes, a tailor\u2019s workshop, and 3 employees (two women and one man). With the current loan I intend to increase the volume of my business and transform the tailor\u2019s workshop into a sales boutique where we would sell appropriate materials and diverse fabrics\u2014right now I only work with fabrics provided by my clients. \r\n<p>Florentina\u2019s business\u2019 impact on the community is great; currently there exists no dressmaker with the same quality of service who also offers greatly reduced costs to visitors to Maputo seeking a dressmaker. Florentina\u2019s services are thus in great demand.     \r\n<p> <b>Translated from Portuguese by Marco Alves, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>Florentina  Maria M., natural de Bela-Vista distrito de Matutuine, de 41 anos de idade, casada maritalmente e m\u00e3e de 2 filhos, filha de pai pol\u00edgamo, cresceu numa fam\u00edlia numerosa com cerca de 22 filhos, dai as dificuldades em ter uma educa\u00e7\u00e3o condigna, para a sua sobreviv\u00eancia dedicava desde crian\u00e7a a pesca artesanal e dada a sua voca\u00e7\u00e3o de corte e costura o pai decidiu aos 18 idade matricular-lhe  na escola de costura.\r\n\r\nPara a compra de material de costura sempre vendeu hort\u00edcolas, e no fim do curso trabalhou numa botequim como servente pois n\u00e3o possu\u00eda nenhuma experi\u00eancia pr\u00e1tica. \r\nPassado um ano adquiriu uma m\u00e1quina de costura e tendo desde ai come\u00e7ado a fazer trabalhos em  casa.\r\n\r\nActualmente conta 4 maquinas de costura e uma de furar bot\u00f5es, uma alfaiataria e 3 empregados sendo duas mulheres e um homem.\r\n\r\nCom o presente cr\u00e9dito pretende ampliar  o volume de negocio e transformar a alfaiataria em boutique pela compra de todo material pr\u00f3prio e diversos tecidos  pois actualmente tem trabalhado com tecidos trazidos pelos clientes.\r\n\r\nA sua actividade tem um impacto bastante grande pois no local onde desenvolve a actividade n\u00e3o existe  modistas com a mesma qualidade dos servi\u00e7os que oferece  reduzido assim  em grande escala os custo de desloca\u00e7\u00e3o aos utentes \u00e0 cidade de Maputo a procura dos mesmo servi\u00e7o, resultando deste modo  numa maior procura dos seus

He came to us originally about a year ago in search of a loan to start a small bike repair shop in the Roma ghetto in Sliven, Bulgaria.  He was one of our first clients and has turned out to be the one in which we have the most pride.  The Roma are viewed by most ethnic Bulgarians as lazy, shifty and entirely untrustworthy; Angel has completely upended that stereotype. <p>\r\n\r\nWhen we met, Angel had worked at a bike repair shop in the commercial center of Sliven for close to 15 years.  Upon the shop\u2019s closing, he aimed to strike out on his own and start a shop within the Roma ghetto.  20,000 Roma live in the neighborhood in conditions that are shockingly below the European average.  Biking isn\u2019t the leisure activity it is for many in the West; rather, for many it is the only affordable way to get around.  For the most part, bikes that the Roma ride have only one gear on a small frame.  <p>\r\n\r\nAfter being denied his loan by six banks, Angel heard about our nascent program.  With a loan of $850, Angel turned a part of his concrete home into his workshop, purchased metalworking tools and bought the supplies he would need.  After a busy summer of work, his business slowed in the late fall with the turn in weather.  However, Angel figured out a way to put his metalworking tools to work and began repairing and making doors and window frames for neighborhood clients.  Six weeks ago, some of his tools broke and he needed to purchase new ones for which we made him a supplemental loan.  In the process, he impressed the metalworking sales agent to the point where he became a leasing agent for the company.  <p>\r\n\r\nAngel now has three lines of business.

Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, known as tontines. Commonly organized by groups of twenty to thirty housewives who live in the same village, the tontines provide poor women throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these associations are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income.

Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, known as tontines. Commonly organized by groups of twenty to thirty housewives who live in the same village, the tontines provide poor women throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these associations are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional tontines from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities. The SEM Fund works to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance.

W. is a 40-year-old, very hard-working single mother of 5 children. She has twins aged 14 and the others are 19, 21, 24 years old. Mary also takes care of her aging mother and two brothers who are drug addicts. They all live in the Kibera slums of Nairobi.\r\n<p>\r\nMary started her business in the year 2000 after getting lessons from her daughter, now aged 24 years, who was trained how to knit using a loom machine by a group of women in Kenya called Maendeleo ya Wanawake Organization. This group teaches women how to get into self-employment using locally available materials. Mary knitted two sets of tablecloths and took them to the offices of Maendeleo ya Wanawake Organization. Fortunately she got buyers and sold the sets of the tablecloths, and earned herself a cheque of Ksh 2000 (USD 29). Mary used this money to buy knitting wool, which she used to make 4 sets of tablecloths. Again she took them to the offices of Maendeleo ya Wanawake and all the 4 sets were bought and by the time she was leaving their offices, she had got orders from a number of people. \r\n<p>\r\nMary\u2019s business has continued to grow and for now she deals with tourists from Switzerland and they love her work very much such that every month she does at least 10 sets of tablecloths for them. Unfortunately, last year, Mary\u2019s brother who is a drug addict took her money to buy drugs. For now Mary\u2019s business is doing poorly due to a shortage of money to purchase materials for knitting. \r\n<p>\r\nRight now Mary has an order to make tablecloths worth Ksh 10,000 (USD 150) but what is drawing her back is the fact that she has no money to buy the materials needed. She has so far not managed to get access to any money to enable her to purchase the needed materials to accomplish her order.\r\n<p>\r\nMary W. therefore requests for a loan of USD 150, which will be given in kind, to enable her purchase materials for knitting the tablecloths. The repayment for this loan will be 8 -14 months. Given this loan Mary will have an increased number of orders to make tablecloths which will generate more income. Mary promises to train at least three people from her community how to knit, and also employ two people to help with the increased workload.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":23402,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"To purchase knitting wool, material and knitting thread","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kibera Slums, Nairobi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":36,"posted_date":"2007-04-09T06:16:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-04-23T11:00:43Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":150,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2007-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2007-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2007-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2007-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2007-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2007-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2007-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":19,"local_amount":19,"processed_date":"2007-05-27T09:17:45Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-27T10:18:18Z","rounded_local_amount":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":17721,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":19,"local_amount":19,"processed_date":"2007-06-27T09:18:03Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-27T10:18:18Z","rounded_local_amount":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":26542,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":19,"local_amount":19,"processed_date":"2007-07-27T09:20:51Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-27T10:18:18Z","rounded_local_amount":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36047,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":19,"local_amount":19,"processed_date":"2007-08-27T09:22:52Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-27T10:18:18Z","rounded_local_amount":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":47079,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":19,"local_amount":19,"processed_date":"2007-09-27T09:23:21Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-27T10:18:18Z","rounded_local_amount":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":59376,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":19,"local_amount":19,"processed_date":"2007-10-27T09:25:22Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-27T10:18:18Z","rounded_local_amount":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":72750,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":19,"local_amount":19,"processed_date":"2007-11-27T10:26:11Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-27T10:18:18Z","rounded_local_amount":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87514,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":17,"local_amount":17,"processed_date":"2007-12-27T10:18:18Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-27T10:18:18Z","rounded_local_amount":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103629,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2007-04-09T11:00:43Z","paid_date":"2007-12-27T10:18:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":5,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":7262,"name":"Isa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Isa has 6 years of experience in this business.\r\nHe has transported  grass with a car, which is rented by him.\r\nThe first time he borrowed $600 and bought 4 wheels.\r\nThe second time he borrowed $800 and repaired the car.

W. is 54 years old, is married and has 5 children. He also takes care of his two grandchildren, the children of his daughter. He decided to take up the responsibility of his grandchildren together with their mother (his daughter) since she had the two children out of wedlock. Rather than send his daughter away, he encouraged and cautioned her to take care of herself not to get another child until she is ready to take care of them. They live in Kayole, an informal settlement area within Nairobi. In addition, Mr. W. is a church pastor, and he also supports some of his church members.\r\n<p>\r\nWilson has been a carpenter now for a period of four years and apart from that, he also does welding. He started by doing small contracts from schools within his community. It was not an easy start but he was driven by determination since he wanted to be involved in another activity besides being a pastor. He borrowed Ksh 20,000.00 (USD 285) from a friend and bought the basic items he needed in the carpentry workshop together with timber. He has been able to settle this loan with time and although he has had many difficulties, he has seen his business expanding through the many contracts he is getting. His major setback is the ability to deal with the growing number of contracts since his customers pay a minimal deposit, barely enough to enable him to make purchases for the requirements. He is now intending to make a set of desks and chairs for two schools within his community before schools reopen for the second term.\r\n<p>\r\nA loan of USD 900 is Wilson\u2019s plea to enable him purchase a drilling machine, timber, block board, and the backs and seats for the chairs. These will go a long way in enabling him to make a wide range of quality furniture for his customers in order to attract additional customers, and to retain the existing ones, especially from the nearby schools. This will also enable him to gain additional income that will help him to support both his family and members of his church better. The repayment period of the loan is 15 \u2013 18 months.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":23443,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Carpentry","sector":"Construction","use":"Purchase

receiving a loan, Ayubjon made cooking batteries from an aluminium sheet. They were sold directly to clients and in part sold in markets. As raw materials were scarce (160 kg. Aluminium), he  produced in small numbers (45 cooking batteries per  month). As aluminium steel cost a lot (3 somoni per 1 kg.), Ayubjon did not have enough capital for wholesale purchase of raw materials. Receiving the first loan, he bought up raw materials from different building materials sales. Ayubjon has increased the volume of manufacture, and his clients have already started to order. Step by step he now has the opportunity of wholesale purchase of raw materials. Ayubjon has put all his profits into active capital and gradually has increased the volume of production. To output cooking batteries he has added two more kinds of production.  Now there are about 2.5 tons of raw material and his factory shop works without days off. The basic change to his business is that Ayubjon can buy raw material in large amounts and plans to increase the range of goods to  create additional profits. The current request for a $1000 loan is to increase the commodity circulation."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":23444,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"Manufacture cooking batteries","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Khujand","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.28 69.631667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":"2007-04-01T21:24:38Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ayubjon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-04-17T01:34:47Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2007-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":166.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":166.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":167,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2007-05-03T09:01:14Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-02T09:24:35Z","rounded_local_amount":167,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14921,"comment":null},{"amount":167,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2007-06-04T10:17:23Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-02T09:24:35Z","rounded_local_amount":167,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20242,"comment":null},{"amount":167,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2007-07-04T07:10:10Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-02T09:24:35Z","rounded_local_amount":167,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":28718,"comment":null},{"amount":167,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2007-08-03T04:45:36Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-02T09:24:35Z","rounded_local_amount":167,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":38193,"comment":null},{"amount":167,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2007-09-02T09:25:28Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-02T09:24:35Z","rounded_local_amount":167,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":49598,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":165,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2007-10-02T09:24:35Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-02T09:24:35Z","rounded_local_amount":165,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":61800,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2007-04-03T01:34:47Z","paid_date":"2007-10-02T09:24:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":7273,"name":"Eloglan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Eloglan has been engaged in this business for 5 years.\r\nHe is a very active and responsible person.\r\nHaving borrowed a loan of $400 he bought 2 calves.\r\nNow he needs a loan of $800 to buy 4 calves.\r\nEloglan is 36, an Internally Displaced Person (IDP) from the Armenian-occupied territory of Azerbaijan, Fizuli region, settled in the Fizuli region, Mahmudlu village.

is divorced and has one grown son. She and her son own a small precision glass-cutting and dicing workshop located in downtown Ivano-Frankivsk. Close proximity to busy train and bus stations makes this a very favorable location for business growth. Danina and her son use both thermal and score and break methods in their work to cut glass that is used in a variety of applications. They have about $4,000 of working capital in the business and their monthly gross revenue amounts to $1,000. \r\n\r\nDanina has been working in this business for 10 years. Originally, she started her entrepreneurial activity as a grocery retailer. However, later she joined her son in operating their glass-cutting and dicing workshop. Hard-work and tenacity have helped this family enterprise reach sustainability and success. \r\n\r\nDanina would like to get a loan for $1,200 to buy sheets of glass which are 3mm or less in thickness for her workshop. The extra supply of glass will help her and her son produce more material for architectural and design applications, as well as for tile, signage and lighting uses. Danina is hoping that increased sales activity will generate the necessary funds to sustain their business as well as to meet her family\u2019s needs.

loves candy. This is essentially what led her to start her business selling candy and baked goods. She runs a small kiosk at the local market that has quickly acquired a reputation for high quality service. After 5 years in business, Ekaterina\u2019s business has blossomed due to her entrepreneurial skills and the kindness she shows to her customers. Today her business yields $2,000 a month in gross income with an investment of $3,000 in inventory. \r\n\r\nEkaterina has requested a loan for $700 to purchase candy and baked goods in bulk. This amount will enable her to purchase 230 kg of sweets, paying only around $2-6 per kg. She believes that broadening her product line will increase her income and allow her to improve the well-being of her family. Ekaterina is raising her 5 year old son by herself. She would like to invest some of her earned income to have a natural gas pipeline put into the house where they currently live so they can enjoy cheaper hot water and

is married and has three children. For awhile she worked as an employee in a store. However, Nataliya has always wanted to be self-employed. Five years ago she started a little business with only a small kiosk selling children\u2019s clothing and shoes in the local city market. Today her business is doing well. She maintains around $1,400 of working capital and her monthly gross income amounts to around $800.   \r\n\r\nNataliya is a focused, hard-worker. Many weeks she will work without days off to make sure her family members have everything they need. Because of her cheerfulness and customer-friendly service her total number of customers is constantly growing. Sixteen loans that she has received from \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d have also assisted the growth of her sales. \r\n\r\nNataliya would like to get a loan of $1,200 to increase her available stock. She is planning to purchase 50 sweaters and 100 pairs of shoes that will re-supply her inventory and encourage more customers to come and buy from her. One of Nataliya\u2019s long-term plans is to open a new vending facility. She believes that this loan will help her succeed in her business endeavors and boost her economic activity. \r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\u041d\u0430\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0456\u044f \u2013

is married and has one child.  She successfully manages a little shop where she sells a variety of non-perishable grocery items such as mayonnaise, ketchup, and canned goods. Elena has been involved in this type of business for more than 6 years. Through her perseverance and hard-work she has been able to reinvest profits into her business and see it develop. Today her total net income amounts to $400 a month and she has about $1,200 invested in inventory.\r\n\r\nElena\u2019s enthusiasm and the relationships she has built with her customers show that she is doing what she does best \u2013 cheerfully serving others. She has created a loyal base of customers that will always try to stop by and purchase from her shop. She is a warm and communicative woman, who looks forward to what the future holds. Her desire is to be a help to her husband as they both strive to support and raise their child.\r\n\r\nElena is requesting a loan of $1,000 to purchase variety of grocery items in bulk. She believes that this will eliminate the need for her to buy products as often and therefore save her some money on transportation and unloading.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\u041e\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0430

is a widow lady and lives by herself. All of her children are grown. After she retired she was forced to find ways to sustain herself and she wanted to help her family. That is how she started as market vendor selling groceries in the central market. Later she changed the type products she sold and moved her business to a different location. Currently, Ibolya runs a kiosk selling slippers, underwear and plastic bags. She has been in business now for 10 years. Her daily sales revenue is about $30-40. \r\n\r\nIbolya is always very affable and polite with her customers. Her good managerial skills help her keep expenses to a minimum. The new market where Ibolya works is the only one in the neighborhood and there are no other entrepreneurs offering the same type of goods. This is another reason for Ibolya\u2019s high sales and the success of her trade. \r\n\r\nIbolya is requesting a loan of $200 to increase her inventory. She is planning to re-stock her kiosk with household items and slippers to boost up her sales. Being a good steward of the money she receives, Ibolya will manage this loan efficiently and repay it on time.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\u0406\u0431\u043e\u043b\u044f \u2013 \u0432\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430,

runs a business selling women\u2019s clothing and shoes in the local market. He decided to start his own business because he believes it is the only way to sustain a family in the present economic situation in Ukraine. He has been in this business for five years now and sees about $1,000 in gross revenue per month. \r\n\r\nIvan is very focused and determined. He is grateful for the loans he has received from \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d that have helped the expansion of his business. Last year Ivan opened two new vending facilities which have promoted solid growth in his sales.  \r\n\r\nIvan is requesting a loan of $500 for several reasons. He is planning to re-supply his inventory and purchase seasonal items which he can get at wholesale prices. It will also give him the resources to open another vending kiosk. The loan will be beneficial for Ivan\u2019s business by keeping it competitive and promoting growth so that it will continue to provide necessary income for Ivan and his

She runs a small business selling flowers in downtown Uzhgorod. Nataliya does special decorating of cars for weddings, makes bridal bouquets and creates the finest floral arrangements for various special occasions.

Currently, she makes around $40-80 per day in gross revenue. Nataliya is a very enterprising lady. She believes she is nowhere near the limit for her business and is planning to open a unique flower storehouse unlike any other in the city.  \r\n\r\nNataliya is requesting a loan for $1,200 to purchase some equipment she will need for her flower storehouse. She\u2019d like to buy a self-contained floral refrigeration system and condensate evaporators that will help keep her plants fresh and fragrant. Nataliya would also like to buy a variety of spring flowers such as daisies, tulips, carnations, daffodils and roses for further retail sale. Being a plant-lover, Nataliya knows that an assortment of flowers will brighten up many people\u2019s hearts after the long, gray winter. She believes that with financial assistance and her commitment to provide the highest quality fresh flowers at competitive prices, she will not only be able to meet the needs of more customers, but

Zoya, selling sporting goods has been a family business. She and her husband have successfully operated two sales kiosks for nearly eleven years, one located in a market and another at a nearby shopping center, that offer a variety of sports related clothing and equipment. Zoya and her husband have sought to create an atmosphere that encourages customers to come back to their stores. One of the ways they have tried to accomplish this is to consistently replenish their stock with newer products. Their current net profit amounts to around $400 per month.\r\n\r\nZoya is an entrepreneur who is full of life. Her ability to accomplish her goals makes her a solid client with Nadiya Ukraine. Her entrepreneurial spirit and good relationship with customers has helped place the business in a favorable position to grow. Ensuring growth for the business will allow her to see her daughter receive a college education upon her graduation from high school this year.  \r\n\r\nZoya has requested $1200 in order to purchase spring items such as shorts and t-shirts and some additional sports equipment. She and her husband want to be prepared for what they hope will be another busy and profitable sports season in the Ukraine.  \r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\u0411\u0456\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441 \u0437

Right now he makes around $600 in net profits every month.   \r\n\r\nCredit services from \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d have been a help to Maxim as he has developed his trade. Financing has enabled him to buy products in bulk, minimizing his purchasing and shipping costs. Extra funds have also helped add stability to his business by providing a cushion for those times when sales have been down. This loan for $1200 will also help Maxim continue to expand by increasing his available capital. Eventually he would like to open additional kiosks which will significantly increase his sales. We would like to continue assisting him with each step as he works hard to build a successful business.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\u041c\u0430\u043a\u0441\u0438\u043c \u2013

nearly nine years, shoppers at the busy Centralnie Rhinok, or central market, in Nikopol have been able to purchase a variety of household and personal cleaning products from Margarita S.. Not that long ago, many of the cleaning supplies that Margarita now sells were not available in the Ukraine. Since the fall of the rigid Soviet system and the resulting freedoms, a tremendous amount of new products are manufactured and sold here that were once unheard of. Margarita has been able to take advantage of the changing markets and influx of new goods and position herself as a reliable supplier of quality products.\r\n\r\nMargarita has developed a reputation as a smart, hard-working and honest entrepreneur. She has a sharp business mind, and understands how to match her product to her customers. Like many working adults in Ukraine she has a very high education with a college degree. Unfortunately, a lack of available good paying jobs makes it hard for people to find work in their field of training. Margarita has been able to make ends meet through her business, however. She is a single mom and provides for herself and her two children.\r\n\r\nShe has requested a loan for $1200 to add to her available capital. She tries to buy new inventory about three times a month. This loan will assist her in keeping a good supply of products on hand so she can keep up with sales. \r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\u041d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0442\u044f\u0437\u0456

thoroughly enjoys meeting the needs of many women for quality, stylish footwear. With the help of her son she manages two sales kiosks at the Angolenko market in Zaporoshie where she sells a variety of shoes and boots. Her extensive 15 years of experience in this area of retail have given her much credibility as well as popularity among buyers and her fellow merchants.\r\n\r\nLudmila\u2019s biggest desire is to efficiently provide for her two sons who she was left to raise on her own. Through her business venture she has been able to provide an education for her older son. Now she would like to provide a good education for her younger son. Ludmila is even willing to downsize her home if necessary and move from a house to an apartment in order to be more conservative with finances.\r\n\r\nLudmila recognizes that spring is a very active sales time when many women look to purchase a new pair of shoes. To meet this demand, she needs to exchange her winter inventory for a spring one. She has requested a loan for $750 that will allow her to buy a spring collection of shoes in bulk in order to provide a nice selection during this busy season.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\u041b\u044e\u0434\u043c\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u0437 \u0440\u0430\u0434\u0456\u0441\u0442\u044e \u0437\u0430\u0439\u043c\u0430\u0454\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f

Second, Diana wants to purchase an overhead sign for her booth in order to attract more attention and develop a brand, as well as provide cover for her products when it rains.  Currently, she covers her socks with plastic during inclement weather, but realizes that potential clients purchase more when they can easily browse merchandise; a plastic covering prevents that.

I am a married mother of 4 children, and I attended school up until the 6th grade. I could not continue my studies due to the 16-year civil war that severely affected the Matutuine district. During the civil war my parents took refuge in neighboring South Africa. For two years I worked as a cabinet-maker in a carpenter\u2019s shop and after that I worked as a housemaid for two residences. In 1989 I married a young Mozambique man who at the time also worked in South Africa. With the end of the civil war in 1992 my husband and I decided to return to Mozambique. In 1994, after settling the family in the city of Maputo, I dedicated myself to the sale of diverse products from my residence. My family found it difficult adapting to urban life and in 1995 we decided to move back to my native home of Salamanga, Matutuine district. That same year I began to work on a project of reintegration for those returning from neighboring countries; I worked as a sewing instructor. At project\u2019s end in 1996 I returned to the sale of everyday goods at the local market. In 1998 I rented a small commercial establishment belonging to my brother, and to this day I continue to work there. At this time my husband and I and 4 other employees depend on this business. With the loan I intend to acquire a vehicle to transport diverse cargo to my commercial establishment.

He has a very limited education, but he is a very hard worker. Although he is over 65 years old, he does not intend to stop working the lands that have provided for him and his family for decades. He feels fortunate to have the opportunity to attain some financing for his lands. He plans to invest in seeds and some pesticides. The loan will help him avoid borrowing from informal lenders who charge way too much and take a large part of the profits he makes from his crops. <\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>The Santa Lucia Communal Bank<\/h4> \r\n<p> Rimigio is part of the newest Communal Banks in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Santa Lucia Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Santa Lucia. Their association works cooperatively to help in the commercialization of the product after it has grown. They will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Primero de Agosto Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p> \r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. Special thanks to Mario Balazantegui who provided expert insight and contributed to the development of the alliances with the local organizations. <\/em><\/p> \r\n<h4>Economy of Santa Lucia<\/h4> \r\n<p>Santa Lucia County has a population of about 33,000 people. The sector is fit for rice cultivating because it is not in the lowlands and therefore it is not at risk of flooding. There is also great access to water because of the Daule River, which is accessible to many of the farmers in the area. About 70% of the farmers have basic infrastructure for watering their crops. <\/p> \r\n<p>Rice production is the main economic activity of the area as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Almost everyone is either directly or indirectly involved with rice production, as they produce, commercialize or participate in activities that add value to the product. Within the county, there is a small town also named Santa Lucia. The town is filled with many small businesses and it serves as the social and commercial hub of the area.  <\/p> \r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia<\/h4> \r\n<p>Most of the people in the Santa Lucia area are small farmers. They produce about 100 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds and plowing. The farmers then fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as <i>boleo<\/i> in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. A risk factor does exist in rice farming because of drought, but in Santa Lucia this is somewhat mitigated by the access to water form the nearby river.  <\/p> \r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4> \r\n<p>The biggest struggle in the area has been the lack of credit. Because people do not count on formal financial services, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops.  <\/p> \r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4> \r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. They will also be used to prepare the land prior to farming, to plant the seeds and purchase other materials. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical micro-entrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p> \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":24334,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Invest in rice harvesting","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santa Lucia","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.183333 -80","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-04-07T16:13:23Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":925,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rimigio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-04-22T03:06:57Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":925,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":132.16}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":132.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-05-07T14:38:59Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-11T22:45:14Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":15386,"comment":"Banca Comunal Asoc 1ero. de agosto Sta lucia 1er pago"},{"amount":170,"local_amount":170,"processed_date":"2007-06-09T09:15:24Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-11T22:45:14Z","rounded_local_amount":170,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":21747,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":-74,"local_amount":-74,"processed_date":"2007-06-30T06:32:30Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-11T22:45:14Z","rounded_local_amount":-74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27047,"comment":"This adjustment was made to compensate for an error with the previous payment posted."},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-07-05T21:32:10Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-11T22:45:14Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":29296,"comment":"3er pago 1 de agosto"},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-08-07T23:45:27Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-11T22:45:14Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":40097,"comment":"4to pago asoc 1ero de agosto"},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-10-10T20:16:55Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-11T22:45:14Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":65653,"comment":"5to pago 1 ero de agosto"},{"amount":445,"local_amount":445,"processed_date":"2007-10-11T22:45:14Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-11T22:45:14Z","rounded_local_amount":445,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":66069,"comment":"6to pago 1 de agosto"}],"funded_date":"2007-04-08T03:06:57Z","paid_date":"2007-10-11T22:45:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":7459,"name":"Sadiah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"S. is 55 years old.

He has been farming rice and raising cattle for about 50 years since he was young. He and his wife Germania have been living on this farm since they were married. They have raised their two kids and fed their family thanks to the fertility of their lands. Their children are all grown up now, but Audencio continues to cultivate rice in order to feed himself and provide additional support to his sons. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>The Santa Lucia Communal Bank<\/h4> \r\n<p>This borrower is part of the newest Communal Banks in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Santa Lucia Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Santa Lucia. Their association works cooperatively to help in the commercialization of the product after it has grown. They will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Primero de Agosto Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p> \r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. Special thanks to Mario Balazantegui who provided expert insight and contributed to the development of the alliances with the local organizations. <\/em><\/p> \r\n<h4>Economy of Santa Lucia<\/h4> \r\n<p>Santa Lucia County has a population of about 33,000 people. The sector is fit for rice cultivating because it is not in the lowlands and therefore it is not at risk of flooding. There is also great access to water because of the Daule River, which is accessible to many of the farmers in the area. About 70% of the farmers have basic infrastructure for watering their crops. <\/p> \r\n<p>Rice production is the main economic activity of the area as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Almost everyone is either directly or indirectly involved with rice production, as they produce, commercialize or participate in activities that add value to the product. Within the county, there is a small town also named Santa Lucia. The town is filled with many small businesses and it serves as the social and commercial hub of the area.  <\/p> \r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia<\/h4> \r\n<p>Most of the people in the Santa Lucia area are small farmers. They produce about 100 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds and plowing. The farmers then fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as <i>boleo<\/i> in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. A risk factor does exist in rice farming because of drought, but in Santa Lucia this is somewhat mitigated by the access to water form the nearby river.  <\/p> \r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4> \r\n<p>The biggest struggle in the area has been the lack of credit. Because people do not count on formal financial services, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops.  <\/p> \r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4> \r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. They will also be used to prepare the land prior to farming, to plant the seeds and purchase other materials. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical micro-entrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p> \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":24340,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Cultivate Rice on his farm","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santa Lucia","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.183333 -80","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-04-08T15:59:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":925,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Audencio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-04-23T16:08:17Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":925,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":132.16}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":132.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-05-07T14:02:02Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-10T20:15:16Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":15384,"comment":"Banco Comunal de Sta Lucia Asociacion 1 de agosto 1era. cuota"},{"amount":170,"local_amount":170,"processed_date":"2007-06-09T09:15:25Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-10T20:15:16Z","rounded_local_amount":170,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":21748,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":-74,"local_amount":-74,"processed_date":"2007-06-30T06:30:30Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-10T20:15:16Z","rounded_local_amount":-74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27046,"comment":null},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-07-05T21:31:38Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-10T20:15:16Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":29295,"comment":"3er pago 1 de agosto"},{"amount":637,"local_amount":637,"processed_date":"2007-10-10T20:15:16Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-10T20:15:16Z","rounded_local_amount":637,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":65651,"comment":"6to pago 1 de agosto"}],"funded_date":"2007-04-09T16:08:17Z","paid_date":"2007-10-10T20:15:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":7465,"name":"Hj.

Carlos has been living on this land for about 30 years, since it was given to him by his father. Because he only has an elementary education, Carlos wants to provide something more for his 4 year-old son. He relies on the income for his rice farming to feed his family and pay for all the household expenses. He has also been raising cattle for several years as a secondary source of income. <\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>The Santa Lucia Communal Bank<\/h4>\r\n\r\n \r\n<p> Carlos is part of the newest Communal Banks in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Santa Lucia Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Santa Lucia. Their association works cooperatively to help in the commercialization of the product after it has grown. They will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Primero de Agosto Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p> \r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. Special thanks to Mario Balazantegui who provided expert insight and contributed to the development of the alliances with the local organizations. <\/em><\/p> \r\n<h4>Economy of Santa Lucia<\/h4> \r\n<p>Santa Lucia County has a population of about 33,000 people. The sector is fit for rice cultivating because it is not in the lowlands and therefore it is not at risk of flooding. There is also great access to water because of the Daule River, which is accessible to many of the farmers in the area. About 70% of the farmers have basic infrastructure for watering their crops. <\/p> \r\n<p>Rice production is the main economic activity of the area as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Almost everyone is either directly or indirectly involved with rice production, as they produce, commercialize or participate in activities that add value to the product. Within the county, there is a small town also named Santa Lucia. The town is filled with many small businesses and it serves as the social and commercial hub of the area.  <\/p> \r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia<\/h4> \r\n<p>Most of the people in the Santa Lucia area are small farmers. They produce about 100 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds and plowing. The farmers then fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as <i>boleo<\/i> in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. A risk factor does exist in rice farming because of drought, but in Santa Lucia this is somewhat mitigated by the access to water form the nearby river.  <\/p> \r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4> \r\n<p>The biggest struggle in the area has been the lack of credit. Because people do not count on formal financial services, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops.  <\/p> \r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4> \r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. They will also be used to prepare the land prior to farming, to plant the seeds and purchase other materials. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical micro-entrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p> \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":24367,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Plant rice on his farm","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santa Lucia","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.183333 -80","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-04-08T15:59:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":925,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carlos","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-04-23T09:12:04Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":925,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":132.16}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":132.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-05-07T14:40:06Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-11T22:46:37Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":15387,"comment":"Banca comunal asoc 1ero. de agosto Sta Luc\u00eda 1er pago"},{"amount":170,"local_amount":170,"processed_date":"2007-06-09T09:15:26Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-11T22:46:37Z","rounded_local_amount":170,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":21749,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":-74,"local_amount":-74,"processed_date":"2007-06-30T06:33:00Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-11T22:46:37Z","rounded_local_amount":-74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27048,"comment":"This adjustment was made to compensate for an error with the previous payment posted."},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-07-05T21:32:43Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-11T22:46:37Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":29297,"comment":"3er pago 1 de agosto"},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-08-07T23:44:25Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-11T22:46:37Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":40096,"comment":"4to pago asoc 1 de agosto"},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-10-10T20:17:30Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-11T22:46:37Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":65654,"comment":"5to pago 1 de agosto"},{"amount":445,"local_amount":445,"processed_date":"2007-10-11T22:46:37Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-11T22:46:37Z","rounded_local_amount":445,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":66070,"comment":"6to pago 1 de agosto"}],"funded_date":"2007-04-09T09:12:04Z","paid_date":"2007-10-11T22:46:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":7487,"name":"Bineta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is a group loan to be shared by the nine women of the  association, led by Bineta B..

Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, known as tontines. Commonly organized by groups of twenty to thirty housewives who live in the same village, the tontines provide poor women throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these associations are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional tontines from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities. The SEM Fund works to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":24384,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Vegetable garden -

is a group loan to be shared by the ten members of the Dioubo association, led by Babacar S..  In their loan application, the group described their business as follows: <p>\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Dioubo group is located in the village of Palmarin.  Composed of people motivated by a common desire, the Dioubo group aims to unite its members in order to contribute to the development of the abovementioned village.  The Dioubo group has adopted the following objectives: to improve the living conditions of its members, to ease the burden of housewives, and to reduce poverty.

Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, which provide the rural poor throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these groups are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional associations from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities. The SEM Fund works to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":24387,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

This group-lending method strengthens social needs in a community and ensures that members cooperate to help one another repay their loans and invest wisely in their business and family.<\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":24513,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase bread, meat, cheese, vegetables, cooking oil, dishes and materials for her food stand","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"DO","country":"Dominican Republic","town":"San Pedro de Macor\u00eds","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"19 -70.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":44,"posted_date":"2007-04-04T18:46:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roberta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-04-18T22:24:45Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":750,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2007-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2007-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2007-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2007-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2007-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":125}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":125,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2007-05-24T20:00:54Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-19T09:23:39Z","rounded_local_amount":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":17150,"comment":null},{"amount":125,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2007-05-24T20:01:11Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-19T09:23:39Z","rounded_local_amount":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":17163,"comment":null},{"amount":-125,"local_amount":-125,"processed_date":"2007-06-22T07:19:08Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-19T09:23:39Z","rounded_local_amount":-125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":25144,"comment":"This is a correction of a previous payment posted in error."},{"amount":250,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2007-07-19T09:17:21Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-19T09:23:39Z","rounded_local_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":33658,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":125,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2007-08-19T09:18:11Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-19T09:23:39Z","rounded_local_amount":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44440,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":125,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2007-09-19T09:18:46Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-19T09:23:39Z","rounded_local_amount":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":56462,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":125,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2007-10-19T09:23:39Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-19T09:23:39Z","rounded_local_amount":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":69515,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2007-04-04T22:24:45Z","paid_date":"2007-10-19T09:23:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":7522,"name":"Hoang","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hoang is 42 and her husband is 52.

Kiva Lender,\r\n\r\nGreat news! Tuok Mun has repaid the Kiva loan early! Kiva and CREDIT MFI make every effort to be as transparent as possible so you can trust the information we give you. In this case, we didn\u2019t let you know that the loan had been repaid at the time. Occasionally, when a loan is repaid early, the payment schedule posted on Kiva doesn\u2019t always match the records of our micro finance partner in Cambodia, CREDIT MFI. As in life, the system doesn\u2019t always run perfectly, but when there is a discrepancy we will alert you as soon as possible so you have all the information about your investment.\r\n\r\nOn the upside, the issue occurred because the client\u2019s business is so successful! Your loan made that possible. Soon you will see a repayment posted on the client\u2019s profile that is larger than the usual amount. This will end the loan and return the funds to your account. We hope you will choose to loan the repaid funds to another entrepreneur who would a like a chance to grow their business as well. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please post them as a comment on this borrowers site and I will be happy to respond. I also encourage you to write comments on the pages of your loan recipients so we can pass along your good wishes to the borrowers.\r\n\r\nWe sincerely apologize for the oversight and are putting policies in place to make sure that it doesn\u2019t happen again. Thank you for giving poor entrepreneurs in Cambodia a chance at success! \r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nSopheap Khiev, Kiva partnership coordinator, Cambodia\r\nMr. Chan Mach, General Manager, CREDIT MFI, Cambodia\r\n"}],"funded_date":"2007-04-07T21:53:56Z","paid_date":"2008-03-04T03:04:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":7574,"name":"Marcela","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Marcela S.

Kiva Lender,\r\n\r\nGreat news! Orn Oeun has repaid the Kiva loan early! Kiva and CREDIT MFI make every effort to be as transparent as possible so you can trust the information we give you. In this case, we didn\u2019t let you know that the loan had been repaid at the time. Occasionally, when a loan is repaid early, the payment schedule posted on Kiva doesn\u2019t always match the records of our micro finance partner in Cambodia, CREDIT MFI. As in life, the system doesn\u2019t always run perfectly, but when there is a discrepancy we will alert you as soon as possible so you have all the information about your investment.\r\n\r\nOn the upside, the issue occurred because the client\u2019s business is so successful! Your loan made that possible. Soon you will see a repayment posted on the client\u2019s profile that is larger than the usual amount. This will end the loan and return the funds to your account. We hope you will choose to loan the repaid funds to another entrepreneur who would a like a chance to grow their business as well. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please post them as a comment on this borrowers site and I will be happy to respond. I also encourage you to write comments on the pages of your loan recipients so we can pass along your good wishes to the borrowers.\r\n\r\nWe sincerely apologize for the oversight and are putting policies in place to make sure that it doesn\u2019t happen again. Thank you for giving poor entrepreneurs in Cambodia a chance at success! \r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nSopheap Khiev, Kiva partnership coordinator, Cambodia\r\nMr. Chan Mach, General Manager, CREDIT
