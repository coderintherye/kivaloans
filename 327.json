E. is from the village of Estrada. She is 49 years old. Imelda is married and has three school-aged children. \r\n\r\nTo make a living, Imelda runs a general store. The main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of products in the local community. Imelda has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 15,000 Philippines pesos (PHP) a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Imelda joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Imelda has successfully repaid a previous loan of 30,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Imelda is requesting a new loan of 35,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Imelda from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk, and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\nNote: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":449113,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

A. is from the village of Estrada. She is 52 years old. Rosario is married and has two school-aged children. \r\n\r\nTo make a living, Rosario runs a general store. The main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of products in the local community. Rosario has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 5,000 Philippines pesos (PHP) a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Rosario joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Rosario has successfully repaid a previous loan of 20,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Rosario is requesting a new loan of 25,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase new items to expand product offering. This loan will be the eighth loan taken out by Rosario from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk, and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\nNote: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":449117,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

B. is from the village of San Mateo. She is 52 years old. May is married and has 6 grown-up children. To make a living, May runs a general store. The main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of different products in the local community. May has been engaged in her business for some years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, May joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. May is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. This loan will be the seventh loan taken out by May from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

His wife and children all help out by tending to the animals at home. \r\n<p>\r\nAmarbat started his business in 2000 and has become quite successful in his trade. He continues to grow his business and has plans to have his own farm and improve his breeding practices in the near future.

He\u2019s 49 years old. He\u2019s married and has 3 children, ages 24, 22 and 18. The middle child is currently going to school. He finished up to 6th grade of the old school system, but he couldn't continue because his parents had serious financial problems. He lives in his own house with his family and he also supports his father, who lives in the city of Maputo, sending him money and food.\r\n\r\nHe left Maputo to go to Beira for a service mission in 1983. That same year he was transferred from Beira to Nampula, north of Mozambique to continue with his activity. Once his service was completed, he returned to the capital city, where he lives now. He\u2019s worked for TCM (Mozambique Transportation and Communications) as HR Manager since 1982, 8 hours a day. After his day time job, he devotes around 4 hours a day to his business. He gets a 7.800.00 salary from his company and 4.000.00mt a month from his business, which he uses for household expenses. He saves around 1.500.00mt from time to time to put on his bank account. \r\n\r\nHe received a loan from Millinium Bim bank, but after he finished his payments he decided to leave. He met Hluvuku through a soccer tournament where he was a referee and Hluvuku was participating, so he decided to visit our organization. This is his 2nd loan for an amount of 20.000.00mt, which he will use to buy products, such as oil, eggs, milk, drinks and others, to increase his stock. His previous loan was for 12.000.00mt which he used for this same activity. (1 dollar = 28.51MT)\r\n \r\nIn the future he would like to request for more loans to make home improvements and to restock him business. For this reason, he\u2019s committed to pay this loan in time and access to more money later.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Jimena Lopez, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":451860,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Buy products, such as oil, eggs, milk, drinks and others","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Boane, Maputo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-26.041667 32.325278","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":"2009-12-19T19:40:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Miguel Luis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":20000,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":878.85},{"due_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":918.58},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":960.1},{"due_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":1003.51},{"due_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1048.87},{"due_date":"2010-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1096.28},{"due_date":"2010-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1145.84},{"due_date":"2010-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1197.64},{"due_date":"2010-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1251.78},{"due_date":"2010-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1308.37},{"due_date":"2010-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1367.51},{"due_date":"2010-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1429.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1493.95},{"due_date":"2011-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1561.48},{"due_date":"2011-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1632.07},{"due_date":"2011-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1705.84}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.66},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.41},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.87},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.39},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.68},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.42},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.24},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.16},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.15},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.24},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.43},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.7},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.08},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.57}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":60.66,"local_amount":1797.43,"processed_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-27T10:27:04Z","rounded_local_amount":1823.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118101669,"comment":null},{"amount":16.15,"local_amount":478.49,"processed_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-18T08:18:10Z","rounded_local_amount":485.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123938332,"comment":null},{"amount":37.77,"local_amount":1119.08,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-30T09:42:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1135.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123938333,"comment":null},{"amount":39.48,"local_amount":1169.89,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:14:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1186.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136698671,"comment":null},{"amount":45.27,"local_amount":1341.3,"processed_date":"2010-05-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:28:06Z","rounded_local_amount":1360.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144732339,"comment":null},{"amount":475.67,"local_amount":14093.81,"processed_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-14T08:53:26Z","rounded_local_amount":14296.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151916133,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-12-21T19:40:25Z","paid_date":"2010-09-14T08:53:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":163505,"name":"Charity","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Charity sells groceries at retail prices to her customers.

He's 46 years old. He's a husband and father of 2 children ages, 14 and 10, both going to school. He\u2019s currently attending his 3rd year studying for a BA in Physical Education at the Universidade Pedag\u00f3gica in Maputo. He lives in his own house with his family and doesn\u2019t support anybody else except for them.\r\n\r\nHe left Massinga for Maputo in 1978 to continue his education, but in 1996 he moved to the District of Boane because he bought land to build his home. He works for the Ministry of Education as a teacher since 1988. He works around 4 hours a day and he devotes the rest of time to his business, which he opened in 1996 with her wife, who also works performing the same activity. They sell corn beer, making around 6.500.00mt a month. He also earn a salary of 6.125.00mt a month, which he uses to cover household expenses. He even saves some money to put on his bank account. \r\n\r\nHe received a loan from the Procredit bank, but he decided to leave after the finished paying it. He met Hluvuku through several campaigns carried out by loan official in his area. This is his 2nd loan for an amount of 15.000.00mt which he will use to buy products such as beer, soft drinks, cigarettes and others, to increase his stock. His previous loan was for 10.000.00mt for this same activity. (1 dollar = 28.51MT)\r\n \r\nIn the future, he would like to request for more loan to begin with a new activity: breeding farmyard chicken to use that money for home improvements.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br

She is 54 years old, a widow, and the mother of 8 children who range in age from 28 to 18 years old.  Of these, she has two sets of twins: one pair that is 26 years old and one pair that is 24 years old.  The youngest go to school.  She only went to school through the 1st grade because her parents wouldn't let her continue.  She lives in her own home with her children and even helps her sister and 4 nieces and nephews with family support.\r\n\r\nShe left Sofala for Maputo, Boane District with her now deceased husband when he was still a soldier.  They made their home in Boane and later, her husband lost his life.  She began agricultural work in order to support her children.  She learned about this work with her parents when she was still in Sofala.  She receives the pension of her deceased husband, which has a value of 4,000 MZN.  1,500 of the aid given for her children goes toward household expenses.  She even manages to save some monthly in her bank account and in Xiqitue (a traditional rotating savings system).\r\n\r\nShe never has had loans through banks.  She found out about Hluvuku through neighbors who are also clients of this institution.  This is her 4th loan, which has a value of 15,000 MZN.  With it, she plans to buy construction materials (beams, panes, cement, sand, and windows) in order to continue with the construction of her house.  The previous loans had values of 8,500 MZN, 13,000 MZN, and 13,000 MZN.  All were for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nIn the future, she would like to ask for more loans in order to continue with the construction of her home and to provide better living conditions for her family.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Erika Korowin, Kiva

He is 29 years old, married, and is the father of 2 children who are 6 and 9 years old.  They both go to school.  He did not go to school because his parents at that time didn't let him study.  This was because they gave priority to working on the machamba (a small agricultural field) and in the cattle pasture.  He lives in the service worker houses with his family and even supports his mother and a nephew, who both live with him.\r\n\r\nHe has never left Boane, only leaving his parents' house to build his own home.  He works together with his wife in Banalandia at a banana production and sales business in Boane District.  He works about 8 hours each day and receives a monthly salary of 1,630 MZN that he uses for household expenses.  He even saves some through Xitique (a traditional rotating savings system).\r\n\r\nHe has never had loans through banks.  He found out about Hluvuku through service colleagues who are also clients of this institution.  This is his 2nd loan, which has a value of 10,000 MZN.  With it, he plans to buy construction materials (beams, panes, cement, steel, sand, and windows) in order to continue with the construction of his house.  The previous loan was for 6,600 MZN, for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nIn the future, he would like to ask for more loans in order to continue to build his house and provide better living conditions for his family.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Erika Korowin, Kiva

Sales are cash- and sometimes credit-based, and their customer base is made up of both men and women. \r\nThe women envisage generating an average monthly profit of 20,500 FCFA; some of this would be saved or spent on family needs, and the rest would be reinvested in the business. \r\nThey aim to ask for more funds in order to equip their store and to satisfy the demands of their customers. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Danielle Treharne, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":451881,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase various items","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:48Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mamou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dj\u00e9n\u00e8ba ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Korotoumou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":300000,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-03-14T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-16T09:31:47Z","rounded_local_amount":51278.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118152476,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-16T08:48:29Z","rounded_local_amount":51278.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123991316,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-03-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T10:00:03Z","rounded_local_amount":51278.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129021591,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:15:12Z","rounded_local_amount":51278.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136746381,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-05-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:22Z","rounded_local_amount":51278.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144778922,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-06-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:16:32Z","rounded_local_amount":51278.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151961137,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-01-03T01:00:21Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T10:16:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":163520,"name":"Carlos Ernesto","description":{"languages":["pt","en"],"texts":{"pt":" Carlos Ernesto N. nasceu na Cidade de Maputo, Prov\u00edncia do Mesmo nome, sul de Mo\u00e7ambique, tem 36 anos de idade, casado e pai de 4 filhos de 6, 7, 9 e 11 anos de idade, todos v\u00e3o a escola.

He is 36 years old, married, and the father of 4 children who are 6, 7, 9, and 11 years old.  All go to school.  He only studied through the 3rd grade because his parents died and he didn't have anybody who could support his studies.  He lives in the service workers houses with his family and even supports his brothers and sisters by sending money for the power and water bills.\r\n\r\nHe left Maputo for Boane in order to set up a new home with his family after he found a new job.  He has worked as a driver in the outlying ironworks sector for more than 10 years and works on average around 10 hours each day.  He receives a monthly salary of 6,799 MZN that he uses for household expenses.  He even saves some in his bank account.\r\n\r\nHe has never had loans through banks.  He found out about Hluvuku through service colleagues who are also clients of this institution.  This is his 2nd loan, which has a value of 8,000 MZN.

They sell at the large market in Sikasso, moving around the various districts and from door to door, for cash and also on credit to a customer base made up of men and women. They are counting on making an average monthly profit of 20,500FCFA each, of which part will be used for savings and the rest invested in their business. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Le Bras, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":451884,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchase of various products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:48Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Habi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"N\u2019Parou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adiaratou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Habi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ma\u00efmouna ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":250000,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-03-14T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":110,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-16T09:31:47Z","rounded_local_amount":50139.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118152477,"comment":null},{"amount":110,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-16T08:48:27Z","rounded_local_amount":50139.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123991317,"comment":null},{"amount":110,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-03-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T10:00:04Z","rounded_local_amount":50139.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129021592,"comment":null},{"amount":110,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:15:12Z","rounded_local_amount":50139.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136746382,"comment":null},{"amount":110,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-05-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:22Z","rounded_local_amount":50139.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144778923,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-01-02T03:39:37Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":163523,"name":"Catelina Boaze","description":{"languages":["pt","en"],"texts":{"pt":" Catelina Boaze N. nasceu no Distrito de Manjacaze, Prov\u00edncia de Gaza, sul de Mo\u00e7ambique, tem 45 anos de idade, vi\u00fava e m\u00e3e de 3 filhos de 22, 16 e 14 anos de idade, todos v\u00e3o a escola.

She is 45 years old, a widow, and the mother of 3 children who are 22, 16, and 14 years old.  All go to school.  She only studied through the 5th grade; she didn't continue because of her parents' financial situation.  She lives in her own house with her family and even supports her sister who lives with her.\r\n\r\nShe left Manjacaze for Boane with her parents when she was only 13 years old in order to seek out better living conditions.  She has worked in the Roma restaurant as a cleaning assistant for more than 1 year.  She has had her own business in her home that she runs with the help of her children for more than 15 years.  She earns about 4,000 MZN per month from this and receives a salary of 2,500 MZN each month that she uses for household expenses.  She even saves some in her bank account.\r\n\r\nShe has never had loans through banks.  She found out about Hluvuku through service colleagues who are also clients of this institution.  This is her 2nd loan, which has a value of 8,000 MZN.  She plans to use it to buy construction material (cement, steel, and sand) in order to continue the construction of her house.  The previous loan was for 5,000 MZN, for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nIn the future, she would like to ask for more loans in order to continue the construction of her house and to start a commercial

Uktam is a 40-year-old married man who lives with his 4 children. He has been running a business of raising and selling cattle. He has 12 years of experience in this field. Since cattle raising and selling is a profitable business, Uktam has become a very successful businessman in a very short period. He works very hard and spends all his time with the cattle, cleaning, feeding and pasturing them. \r\n<p>\r\nNow Uktam wants to expand his business and buy more cattle. Therefore Uktam applied for a loan of $3000 USD. He thanks all lenders for their support.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

is 42 years old. He is a divorced with three children. He is a retailer of car spare parts and scraps. He buys his supplies from spare-parts dealers and sells on a retail basis to his customers. He enjoys his trade very much. However, he is handicapped by low working capital since prices have gone up.

esposo qued\u00f3 sin trabajo intempestivamente y debi\u00f3 ingeni\u00e1rselas para cumplir con los compromisos familiares especialmente los relacionados con la educaci\u00f3n de sus hijos y los gastos generales del hogar. Esta situaci\u00f3n la llevo a descubrir su potencial empresarial y es as\u00ed como por primera vez se dedica a comercializar productos de belleza adquiridos a trav\u00e9s de una amiga, pues ella no pod\u00eda hacerlo directamente porque no ten\u00eda dinero para iniciar y carec\u00eda de una historia crediticia por ser desconocida en el comercio. Gradualmente reuni\u00f3 un capital,  producto de su esfuerzo,  perseverancia y disciplina, que le sirvi\u00f3 para afiliarse a una empresa y poder exhibir productos mediante gu\u00edas especializadas, construyendo as\u00ed su propia clientela, que la impuls\u00f3 a incursionar en la venta de otras mercanc\u00edas  solicitadas  que no encontraban en la revista para la cual trabajaba. \n\nCon el  incremento de sus ingresos empez\u00f3 a comprar por vol\u00famenes pero su mercanc\u00eda no estaba protegida, pues no tenia donde guardarlas y se le dificultaba el control de sus inventarios;esta forma de trabajar la manten\u00eda mucho tiempo fuera de su hogar, razones por las que se esforz\u00f3 para comprar vitrinas que protegieran sus productos y los exhibieran  en un sitio fijo, para ello pens\u00f3 en abrirle un espacio a este prop\u00f3sito en su vivienda, una Miscel\u00e1nea que todos en su barrio y en los alrededores ahora conocen. Ella ha superado muchas dificultades la mas dif\u00edcil ocurri\u00f3 cuando su negocio se mostr\u00f3 m\u00e1s pr\u00f3spero y tenia autosuficiencia sin necesidad de endeudarse, su peque\u00f1a nieta enferm\u00f3 y parte de su capital lo dirigi\u00f3 a lograr la recuperaci\u00f3n de su salud. Fue entonces cuando recurri\u00f3 a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, por primera vez, para buscar apoyo. Su nueva financiaci\u00f3n le ayudar\u00e0 para comprar productos de belleza e higiene,adornos, ropa interior,detalles para el hogar y mercanciasa que aun vende a trav\u00e9s de cat\u00e1logos como vestidos para damas y caballeros.\n\nSu m\u00e1ximo sue\u00f1o es separar el negocio de su vida familiar para equilibrar efectivamente su vida laboral, personal y de hogar, planea organizar un local independiente de su casa y gradualmente comprar nuevos exhibidores de mercanc\u00eda para ello Myriam trabajar\u00e0 duplicando sus esfuerzos con el acompa\u00f1amiento de su esposo. \n \n    \n \n\n","en":"Myriam lives with her husband in the Altos de Betania de Sabanagrande Atl\u00e1ntico neighborhood.  The neighborhood is characterized by houses that were raised with great effort by its inhabitants.\n\nMyriam is a natural businesswoman.  She started her first business in 1998 when her husband was suddenly left without work.  She needed to figure out how to meet the family commitments, especially those related to her children\u2019s education and the general household expenses.  This situation led her to discover her business potential.  \n\nThat is how she came, for the first time, to sell beauty products that she got from a friend.  She could not do it directly because she did not have money to start, and she lacked a credit history because she was not known in the business.\n\nGradually, through her effort, perseverance, and discipline, she got together the capital to affiliate herself with a business.  She was able to display her products through special guides and build her own customer base.  This drove her to start selling other requested merchandise that could not be found in her business\u2019 magazine.\n\nWith the increase in earnings, she started to buy in bulk.  But, her merchandise was not protected, and she did not have a place to store it.  It was difficult to control her inventory.  This work kept her away from home a lot.  That is why she put forth much effort to buy display cases to protect her products and display them in a fixed place.  She thought of opening a place in her home.  It is a small general store, and everyone in the neighborhood and surrounding area knows it.  She has overcome many difficulties.  The most difficult happened when the business was more prosperous, and she was self-sufficient without the need of going into debt.  Her little granddaughter became ill, and part of her capital went towards her granddaughter\u2019s recuperation.  \n\nThat was when she turned to the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, for the first time, to look for help.  Her new loan will help her to buy beauty products, hygiene products, decorations, underwear, items for the home, and merchandise like clothing for women and men that she still sells through catalogs.\n\nHer biggest dream is to separate the business from her family life in order to effectively balance her work life and her personal home life.  She plans to organize a place independent from her house and gradually buy new showcases for her merchandise.  To do this, Myriam, with her husband, will work by doubling her efforts.\n\n    \n \n\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

casa de un hermano en la busqueda nuevos horizontes para poder ayudar a sus padres, inicialmente trabaj\u00f3 en oficios varios y simult\u00e1neamente se capacit\u00f3 para poder superarse; as\u00ed realiz\u00f3 cursos de primeros auxilios, actividad que le facilit\u00f3 posteriormente su trabajo cuidando adultos mayores,  como su salud se deterior\u00f3 por su ritmo de trabajo, debi\u00f3 buscar otra actividad que le generara ingresos y adaptada a su recuperaci\u00f3n, es as\u00ed como desde hace tres a\u00f1os, se inicia en la venta de productos a trav\u00e9s de cat\u00e1logos  que promociona a clientes del barrio Carlos Meisel y sus alrededores, sitios destacados por su amplia gama de negocios informales; ella, realiza una visita de preventa persona a personas,  exhibiendo sus productos mediante gu\u00edas especializadas que le suministra la empresa a la cual est\u00e1 afiliada, conoce y explica las bondades de cada producto para generar la compra de ellos. Su dedicaci\u00f3n  le ha generado un importante n\u00famero de clientes a los que vende a cr\u00e9dito y recupera su cartera en plazos quincenales aunque tambi\u00e9n vende de contado de acuerdo al monto del pedido.\n\nUna de las dificultades que manifiesta es que su capital de trabajo no responde al numero de pedidos requeridos por su clientela, por eso recurre a la financiaci\u00f3n pues conoce su probabilidad de acceder a cr\u00e9ditos porque ha construido una buena historia crediticia en la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, con quien viene trabajando desde  el a\u00f1o 2007. Mar\u00eda manifiesta que con los cr\u00e9ditos y el control de su endeudamiento, aprendido en la capacitaci\u00f3n empresarial, ha logrado estabilizar sus ingresos. \nSu pr\u00f3xima meta es adquirir vitrinas, diversificar su mercanc\u00eda y poner una miscel\u00e1nea, pues considera que es bien reconocida en el suroccidente de Barranquilla y sus clientes necesitan un sitio fijo donde ubicarla, para ello se prepara observando su mercado  y estando atenta a nuevas oportunidades de productos que le generen mayor margen de utilidad. Su m\u00e1ximo desaf\u00edo es tener una casa propia para independizarse, pero es una meta a largo plazo en la que no deja de pensar. Ella reconoce que desarrollar un negocio ha ido de la mano con su crecimiento personal, el cual se ve reflejado en la seguridad de si misma. \n \nEl cr\u00e9dito inmediato, por valor de $500.000 lo va a emplear en surtir el negocio con cosm\u00e9ticos, multiusos, lencer\u00eda  acordes a los pedidos de su clientela,  de esta manera  es oportuna y ofrece  un mejor servicio manteni\u00e9ndolos satisfechos.  \n","en":"Mar\u00eda left Sinc\u00e9 \u2013 C\u00f3rdoba, where her parents lived, and went to her brother\u2019s house in the city of Barranquilla to look for new horizons to be able to help her parents.  She started working different jobs, and at the same time she received training to be able to improve herself.  She took first aid courses, which later helped her get work taking care of elderly people.  As her health deteriorated because of her work schedule, she needed to look for other work that would generate income and accommodate her recuperation.  \r\n\r\nThat is how she started selling products by catalog three years ago.  She sells to customers in the Carlos Meisel neighborhood and the surrounding areas, which are known for their wide range of informal businesses.  She makes pre-sales visits from person to person.  She shows her products through specialized guides provided by the business she is affiliated with.  She knows and explains the benefits of each product to generate its purchase.  Her dedication has generated an important number of customers.  She sells to them on credit, and she collect payments biweekly.  She also sells for cash depending on the amount of the order.\r\n\r\nOne of the difficulties she has is that her working capital does not correspond to the number of customer orders.  That is why she turns to the loan.  She knows her probability of getting loans because she has built a good credit history with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation.  She has been working with them since 2007.  Mar\u00eda demonstrates with her loans and the control of her debt that she has learned, through her business training, to stabilize her income.\r\n\r\nHer next goal is to get display cases, diversify her merchandise, and establish a general store.  She is well known in the southwestern part of Barranquilla.  Her customers need a fixed place to find her.  To that end, she prepares by observing her market and being attentive to new opportunities for new products that will generate a larger margin of profit.  \r\n\r\nHer biggest challenge is to have her own house to become independent.  It is a long term goal, which she does not stop thinking about.  She recognizes that the development of her business goes hand in hand with her personal growth.  That is a reflection of her self-confidence.\r\n\r\nShe will use the loan for 500,000 COP to stock her business with cosmetics, multipurpose items, and lingerie according to customer orders.  This is expedient, and she will offer better service, which will keep her customers satisfied\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

It is a town with affable, happy people and strong commercial activity.  She is an active woman who is part of the Junta de Acci\u00f3n Communal in the area.  She is a delegate to the Association that governs the community structures in the city.  She started working as a businesswoman in the popular neighborhood of Montes over five years ago.  During that time she connected with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation in the hopes of getting business training and a loan to sell products by catalog.  From that time on the Foundation has given her four loans.  They were gradually increased as they were reimbursed.  Two years ago she took advantage of the opportunity of having a more stable business.\r\n\r\nHer brother, because of travel, gave her a place in rental condition outfitted with display cases and shelves but without merchandise.  She set up a drugstore with variety items at this place.  The Mario Santo Domingo Foundation gave her the second loan for 1,5000,000 COP, which was to be repaid in 12 months.  When the drugstore was stocked, her earnings started to increase very quickly.  Her volume of sales required her to devote herself completely to this activity.  This experience has strengthened her business performance.  Her capacity to observe and the permanent formation of her business have allowed her to identify a potential market for paper products.  She is planning to direct her strategy towards increasing her merchandise.\r\n\r\nShe will use 50% of her next loan for 2,300,000 COD for common allopathic medicine, dietary supplements, toiletries, and hygiene products.  She will use the other 50% to buy stationery items like pencils, cardboard, sheets of paper, pens, folders, highlighters, notebooks, agendas, memos, pencil sharpeners, newspapers, binders, CDs, cards, and office sets.  This is her merchandise plan for now.\r\n\r\nEsperanza\u2019s life conditions have notably improved.  Through her efforts she has been able to support her only child, and he has been able to study music at the Atl\u00e1ntico University.  He is her greatest motivation.  Her immediate dream is that he becomes a professional.  \r\n\r\nHer next challenge is to expand her business by renting the location next to her business.  She still lives in her father\u2019s house.  She is separated, and her parents need her company.  She worries constantly about innovation and adjusting to the market\u2019s requirements.  She always attempts to offer her customers the seasonal requirements.  She knows perfectly the seasonal conditions for each group of products that she sells.  Her offers are governed by the peaks of seasonal customer demand.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

R. was born in and lives in the Barlovento neighborhood of Barranquilla.  It is an ancient community, which was invaded.  It is extremely vulnerable.  It is characterized by the activity of recycling.  Since she was little she was involved in making food because her parents did.  They did this on the outskirts of the ancient town river. They worked in this area because of its proximity to a branch of the largest river in Colombia, El Magdalena.\n\nShe is the oldest of four siblings.  She lived with her mother and the abandonment of her father.  That is why she saw the need to help with the household chores and with the business when she was barely ten years old.  She helped in order to get her younger siblings ahead.  This prevented her from going to school.  Reading and writing were not a practical necessity, and they were not important to the families of that era.\n\nRepeating her parents\u2019 history, Mar\u00eda del Carmen had twins after becoming engaged.  At first, her spouse supplied the basic family necessities.  But, after a short amount of time he abandoned them.  She had to work very hard to get her family ahead.  Without an education, and with the knowledge of the work she learned as a child, she started to sell \u201carepas de huevo\u201d (egg-filled savory corn cakes), empanadas, \u201ccariba\u00f1ola\u201d (small pie made with dough or puree of yucca that is filled with stew like ingredients and then fried), and fast food in the towns that are close to where the festivities for the national holidays are held.  \n\nAs a result of her second relationship, which lasted a short amount of time because he died, she built a house and educated her children until they had a technical career.  As time went by, she acquired the restaurant that her mother left her when she died.  The restaurant is now in her house, and her daughter and her sister work there.  \n\nFinancially helped with two loans, which she successfully repaid, from the Mario Santo Domino Foundation, she has been able to make on-site improvements to the infrastructure.  With her third loan, Mar\u00eda will buy chairs and utensils.  Her customers have increased, and when they arrive they have to wait for empty spaces to eat.  Everything then turns into chaos.  She will also buy rice, pork ribs, bacon, chicken, vinegar, oil, vegetables, and capers; which are the ingredients for making pies, \u201chayacas\u201d (cornmeal, meat and vegetables wrapped in banana leaves) or special foods; which are made from bijao leaves.  This is one of her specialties.  This way she takes advantage of the consumer habits that the customers have this time of year, and she will increase her sales.\n\nMar\u00eda\u2019s daughter helps her with reading and writing to participate in the business trainings.  Together they apply what they have learned to benefit the restaurant.  Her happiness, tenacity, love of work, deliverance, sacrifice and constant work stand out to us.  She has overcome adversity to give her family an improved well being.  Her greatest goal is that her children be able to continue with the business.  The business will be technically updated and perpetuated through the new generations.  Her greatest worry is the labor instability that reigns and puts the economy at risk.  Therefore, they direct their efforts towards keeping their best customers and getting a greater number of customers to buy with cash to minimize the risk.\n\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish

She is 62 years old and lives with her husband and two of her seven children.  She learned one of the most productive skills common to this part of the country over 34 years ago from her mother:  cushion making.  These were sold to furniture and home decorating stores.  She began her business with just one, simple, used sewing machine making bedspreads that she would sell to acquaintances and family members who ordered the items from her.  Today, besides bedspreads, she makes attractive comforters, purses and cushions.  This line of work has provided her important earnings which she has used to help pay for her seven children's education through high school.  Since 1993, Gloria has had 15 loans from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  The first and smallest of which was for $160,000.00, and the largest for $3'000,000.  Her repayment history is excellent.  She is aware of the high peaks in her business and, together with her advisor, analyzes the cost benefit ratio of each loan.  On this occasion, she needs $1,000,000 to be used to buy fabric and lining to make bedspreds and quilted bed covers that she will sell based on her customers' orders.  She has taken advantage of the financing opportunities to invest in working capital.  She bought a new sewing machine that allowed her recently to start making comforters and quilted bedspreads.  Her dream is to enlarge her workshop and to be able to sell in her own store with her eldest daughter so that the family tradition will be preserved.  Gloria is a wise and honest woman that is careful to nurture her relationships with the institutions and persons that have helped her.  Besides, she is an exemplary mother who transmits to her children the value of resposibility and self-sufficiency which has led them to continue their studies thanks to their own efforts.<br

Elizabeth proyecta  en esta \u00e9poca de alta comercializaci\u00f3n aumentar  sus ventas y con la  utilidad esperada ahorrar\u00e1 para pagar el cr\u00e9dito, los gastos  del colegio de su hija del a\u00f1o 2010 y reinvertir\u00e1 de acuerdo con la \u00e9poca que se avecina en los meses de Enero y febrero, relacionada con el ingreso de los estudiantes al colegio y las fiestas del Carnaval de Barranquilla simult\u00e1neamente.\n\nElizabeth Mar\u00eda, es una excelente miembro de familia y muy responsable en el cumplimiento de sus obligaciones financieras, durante 3 a\u00f1os que lleva accediendo a tres cr\u00e9ditos de la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo los ha rembolsado oportunamente, porque los direcciona  al aumento de su capital de trabajo para poder crecer y sostenerse. Ella sue\u00f1a a mediano plazo con tener un local y  una  nueva maquina  de coser que permita dar un mejor acabado a las prendas y fortalecer su mercado en otras localidades cercanas, pero reconoce que debe esperar hacer unos esfuerzos mayores de incursi\u00f3n comercial  para poder cumplir sus metas.\n","en":"Elizabeth Mar\u00eda A. is the second of four siblings.  She is married and has a 13-year-old daughter who is in 9th grade.  She lives in Galapa, her home town, and one of the oldest in Atl\u00e1ntico department.  It is rich in cultural history, especially the wood and papier mache masks, woven reed crafts, sewing, painting on fabric, and dance.  These activities gather the traditions of its inhabitants and enrich Colombia\u2019s most famous festivals like the Carnival in Barranquilla, a city that is located 15 minutes away from Galapa.  Elizabeth Mar\u00eda finished second grade and taught herself in an empirical way how to communicate with her family and others using signs because, being hearing impaired, she never had the proper training in these skills.  But her family, who are her guiding posts with respect to her personal development, helped her to realize her potential by providing her with technical painting courses.  This allowed her, three years later, to be able to set up a small crafts business which consists of decoration and painting of fabrics.  With this, her self-esteem and her self-sufficiency grew.  Thus, with her immense desire to better herself and the loving support of her family, she learned how to sew on a family sewing machine and today she makes articles of clothing on which she applies the learned skills as value added.  These are alternative products that have expanded her market and that have been made possible thanks to financial support from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, with whom she has been associated for the last 3 years.  Currently, she hopes to receive a loan for $1.500.000 that will be repaid in 18 month.  45% of it will be used to buy felt appliqu\u00e9s, sequins, beads, and a variety of other appliqu\u00e9s specially selected to decorate homes and families during the Christmas season with tablecloths, cushions, sheets, comforters, towels, pillows, trivets, throw rugs, curtains, and pictures that beautify the homes of those that request them.  55% will be used to buy fabric to make dresses on order that her customers will wear during these festivities.  Elizabeth projects that this high sales season will increase her profits from which she will save enough to repay the loan, pay for her daughter\u2019s 2010 school expenses and still have some to reinvest for the January and February seasons that are approaching, which are related to back-to-school and Carnival in Barranquilla.  Elizabeth Mar\u00eda is an excellent family member and very responsible with respect to her financial obligations.  She has had 3 loans in the three years that she has been getting loans from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo; she has always repaid them in a timely fashion because she invests them in her business to grow and sustain herself.  She hopes in the not too distant future to have a workshop and a new sewing machine that will permit her to make still better finishings on her clothing and to strengthen  her market in nearby locations but she knows that she might have to make greater efforts to make commercial inroads if she is to reach her goals.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva

Almost 30 years ago she emigrated to the city of Barranquilla searching for better opportunities.  She settled in the El Romance neighborhood, a very marginal area that doesn\u2019t even have basic services.  As a female head of household, she began her business because her income was insufficient to cover family expenses.  She risked borrowing money from a private individual to start selling merchandise on order.  She would visit potential customers, find out their needs and, once she had all the orders, would buy the merchandise and then distribute it door-to-door where she would leave them on credit.  She would sketch out a payment plan with set collection dates when she would revisit her customers to collect her debts.  This is the same methodology she uses to this day although now she also has a space in her home that she set up as a sales shop equipped with a showcase where she displays her wares.  The Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo has granted her 26 gradually larger microloans thanks to the good management of them she has.  She has used them to improve the infrastructure of her house and to support her household\u2019s expenses.  Having this business has meant self-assurance and independence for her and has allowed her to help her family.  With her new $1.300.000 loan, payable in 18 months, she plans to buy perfumes, footwear, cosmetics, fabrics, bedspreads, and women\u2019s accessories to meet actual customers\u2019 needs.  Her next challenge is to improve her home\u2019s condition with the profits generated from her sales.  She realizes that this is the time of year when merchandise has high turnover and sales are in cash.  She is an older, very active, responsible, and honest woman who, at the age of 78, still plays a central role in her home; she lives with two of her daughters, her sons-in-law and grandchildren.   Currently, Celina Leonor is the \u201cNuevo Horizonte\u201d group leader.  It was formed to gather older adults, with the support of Barranquilla\u2019s Mayor\u2019s office.  She participates with more than 200 persons from the south-west.  Of these, 40% are her customers, with whom she shares leisure activities, recreation, health and training courses.  She is a great community leader.  She negotiates help and other bureaucratic processes before authorities and she knows how to combine this task with her economic activity.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by

She has a beauty salon called \u201cSala de Belleza Mente y Arte.\u201d  She offers manicure, pedicure, hair drying, hair treatment, and hair cutting services, primarily.  She started her business 8 years ago when she didn\u2019t have a shop open to the public; she would go to her customers\u2019 homes to provide services.  In December, 2008, she took out her first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  It was for $1.200.000, which she used to equip a salon in her home.  This time she hopes to use this loan, for the same amount, to buy a beautician\u2019s station, to improve the shampooing station, to buy products she uses with her customers, and to invest in publicity to reach a wider market.  Yadira\u2019s main goal is to modernize her beauty salon.  In the immediate future she wants to acquire the technology that will help her to better assess her customers\u2019 needs and to hire personnel to generate higher income and to be a source of employment.  She knows her work very well; that\u2019s why she extends her working days during periods of maximum productivity and she has special promotions on the less busy days.  The excellent quality of her services has situated her well in the marketplace, a reality that is reflected in her personal and family stability because household income has increased.  During the next year she is scheduled to participate in the Fundaci\u00f3n\u2019s business development program.  Thanks to the fact that Yadira is an organized and responsible woman, she attempts daily to learn how to manage her administrative operations, to evaluate her debt capacity, and to design marketing strategies to make her business a solid enterprise.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva

Out of the need to get ahead and show their families that everything in life is possible if you have the drive and the wish to overcome, they formed a group to access loans and thus grow their businesses. All of them live in the city of Cuenca, land of many traditions and dreams, a city that all who visit promise to visit again. \r\n\r\n<p>Ms. Ana L. is a member of this bank. She is 58 years old, married and the mother of four children. All of them are adults. Her first three children are all married and live on their own. Her youngest daughter is a single mother and she lives with her at home, sharing the household expenses. She takes care of her grandson until her daughter comes home from work. Her husband no longer works due to a spinal injury that forced him to close his architectural office. Ana and her husband were able to build their own home.    \r\n\r\n<p>Ana has her own sewing workshop where she makes mainly pajamas and other lines that are in style or according to the season. She delivers her produtions wholesale to the Feria Libre markets in Cuenca, Azogues, Ca\u00f1ar, Santa Isabel, and to her neighbors in her community. She has no set work schedule since when she has a lot of work she works until the late night hours from Sunday to Sunday to finish the orders. On Wednesdays, she delivers the orders to her clients and she only rests when she has no pending orders.

Fatima gets her supplies at Dantokpa, the international market of B\u00e9nin. Fatima has been doing this for about ten years. Fatima repays her loans. To strengthen her funds and increase her stock of products, to better answer her customers requests, Fatima is requesting another loan from ALID\u00e9.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Colleen Creegan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":452094,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"The purchase of bags of rice and beans and ingredients for sauces (tomatos, onions, hot peppers, etc.) ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Cotonou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.35 2.433333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2009-12-20T19:40:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":100000,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T10:13:38Z","rounded_local_amount":10255.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118020493,"comment":null},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T08:21:48Z","rounded_local_amount":10255.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123858986,"comment":null},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2010-04-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:40:36Z","rounded_local_amount":10255.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136619129,"comment":null},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2010-05-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:40:05Z","rounded_local_amount":10255.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144653048,"comment":null},{"amount":45,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:08:39Z","rounded_local_amount":20511.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151835163,"comment":null},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2010-08-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-16T07:56:15Z","rounded_local_amount":10255.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166954047,"comment":null},{"amount":45,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-30T08:51:33Z","rounded_local_amount":20511.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172055713,"comment":null},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2010-11-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T12:28:21Z","rounded_local_amount":10255.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182482406,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-12-21T03:20:18Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T12:28:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":163627,"name":"Adwoa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Adwoa is a 53-year-old married mother of three children who are all in school.

His wife had seven children, only one is studying and at the same time, he works in a book store to make up for his school expenses, since his parents do not have the economic resources to support him. Julio works as a security guard and his salary is low. He had constructed his house with financing from Afodenic, it was difficult to build his house, since all the construction materials are expensive. First, he was working as construction worker and welder, and then, as a truck driver but later he found this job. Although the salary is low, it\u2019s a permanent job.

She lives and works with her husband, with whom she shares her dreams, such as having a well-stocked small business that will allow her to constantly improve her living conditions and prepare her for when they have children. \r\n\r\nShe was born in the traditional and pretty Sim\u00f3n Bolivar neighborhood of Barranqilla, where her widowed mother raised her and her brothers. Her mother had a restaurant there, but she was removed from that location. She continued the business next to the Don Juan creek and next to a dangerous garbage dump. Her mother eventually took Imelda and her brothers to their maternal grandmother\u2019s house to live, so that she could protect them and also continue with the business. The restaurant finally failed because of the constant attacks by thieves and the constant flooding from the previously mentioned creek.\r\n\r\nBecause of these problems, Imelda enrolled in university without economic support from her mother, who had lost everything. Since she had had up-close work experience, she got a job in a restaurant and later in a store so that she could pay her expenses and finish her studies. She never forgot her dream, which was \u201cTo have a well-stocked store.\u201d When she finished her studies, she married Javier P\u00e9rez, who worked in a store and shared the same dream. So, they scraped together 2,000,000 COP to rent their first business location, well stocked with snacks, staple foods, and grocery items. However, they didn\u2019t have enough to buy some types of merchandise. Now Arturo Mart\u00ednez, an advisor with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, advises Imelda and her husband. They participated in business training and received their first loan in the amount of 800,000 COP, which was gradually increased as the loans were repaid. That\u2019s how they have received two more loans, reaching the amount of 3,000,000 COP. With the loans Imelda has managed to increase her working capital and buy vitrines and shelving. They now own the store and they have a big challenge: \u201cTo buy a house so we don\u2019t have to keep moving,\u201d and to invest in improvements in a space that isn\u2019t theirs yet. In order to achieve this, the couple works hard and their love is their greatest motivation. \r\n\r\nDuring this season, Imelda planned to receive a loan in the amount of 2,000,000 COP to purchase staple foods and toys at wholesale price so that she can receive good discounts. The loan will be repaid in two months because this merchandise will be paid for up front by customers [as opposed to being paid for on credit]. This couple is an example of unity through love, persistence, and hard work.\r\n \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jennifer Day, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":452108,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase staple foods and toys at wholesale price.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2009-12-21T08:10:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Imelda Patricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":2000000,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":988061},{"due_date":"2010-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1011939}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":494.03},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":505.97}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":494.03,"local_amount":988061,"processed_date":"2010-01-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:35:30Z","rounded_local_amount":996469.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118077180,"comment":null},{"amount":505.97,"local_amount":1011939,"processed_date":"2010-02-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:09:31Z","rounded_local_amount":1020550.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123913403,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-12-21T12:37:45Z","paid_date":"2010-03-15T10:09:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":163703,"name":"Rita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rita is fifty-eight years old, married, and has three children, all of whom are still in school.

He is originally from Polonuevo-Regencia, a community in the department of Bolivar. He finished high school with support from his parents. He is grateful to his parents and 5 siblings for the material and emotional support they provided him after he suffered polio when he was 4 years old. He was left with difficulties that prevent him from moving very quickly. He now has his own family with his wife and three children.\n\nFernando is an enthusiastic and optimistic man. He started a business selling sweets and cigarettes with money lent to him by his sister and it has grown, little by little. When he increased his number of customers, he took loans from street lenders to diversify his business of selling soft drinks, fried foods, and sweet breads. This type of financing turned out to be onerous and many people from his neighborhood told him about Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, and that was when he began his association with this institution. With his first loan he repaid his previous, expensive loans. He is now requesting a second loan to purchase soft drinks, sweets, bread products, shelving, and he will improve the infrastructure of his business by putting a covering over it, because during the rainy season things get wet and he doesn\u2019t have time to put away his furniture and other belongings. Most of his customers are workers in the industrial workshops that fill this busy commercial area of town.\n\nFernando thanks God every day for the love of his family and the support of the institutions and all of the people who have believed in him. For the future, he hopes to continue being the pillar of strength for his household and, along with his wife, to provide a good example for his 3 children and to give them an education. \n<br

C. is 42 years old, lives with his wife and two children in a rural community of Costa Rica called San Gabriel, located in Yolillal, Upala in the province of Alajuela.  It is a rural community with a relatively large extension, which lies within the semi-mountainous topography of Costa Rica in Central America. The main activity in the community is centered on agriculture, especially the cultivation of grains, and livestock breeding to a lesser extent.\r\n\r\n10 years ago, Epifanio works in this activity, in particular the production of milk.  He is able to sell his products to the neighbours of his community, who seem very satisfied with the quality of the products he offers.  In his particular situation, the demand is higher than what he can supply.\r\n\r\nEpifanio considers that thanks to the progress of this project, him and his family have slowly improved their life conditions and have been able to be part of the development of their community.\r\n\r\nNow Epifanio wishes to obtain a loan for 200,000 colones to purchase two cows and this way increase production.  He knows that having more cows means more sacrifice and will require more work.  However, his wishes to be a succesful entrepreneur and get his family ahead by improving their life conditions, motivates him to work harder.\r\n\r\nEpifanio belongs to the community credit enterprise of San Gabriel, one of the 100 organizations partners to EDESA in Costa Rica.  This will be his third loan and he says that with it he wishes to grow as an entrepreneur and get his business ahead.  He also points out that thanks to this type of organizations and credit facilities he can focus more time to production actitvities.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Sofia Burt, Kiva

R. is a young man of 29 who lives with his mother and brother. They live in a community called El Sa\u00edno de Pital located in the province of Alajuela. The community's main productive activities are cattle farming and agriculture. The main focus is the cultivation of pineapple which is sold mainly on the international market.  For this reason, the community's development has grown in recent years generating a great demand for products and services, which helps to mitigate the effect of immigration.\r\n\r\nFor some time Diego has focussed on pineapple planting, therefore, he says that he has enough experience in the care and maintenance of this kind of cultivation. He has a plot of land on which he has previously planted pineapple and it has given him very good results at distribution time, therefore he wants to expand his plantation, since thanks to this business his family's quality of life has improved considerably.\r\n\r\nThe micro loan Diego is asking for currently is \u00a2300,000 (three hundred thousand colones), to buy baby pineapple plants and various supplies to give the best possible maintenance and care to his crop, so that in the end he will be able to be rewarded and have a very good output. \r\n\r\nDiego is a member of the Luz del Futuro Saino Communal Bank, one of the 100 organanizations that are members of EDESA in Costa Rica. This will be his first loan and with it he hopes to continue growing on a personal and economic level. He also acknowledges that thanks to this type of organization and means of providing credit he can dedicate more time to productive activities. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by

B. is a young man 21 years old who lives in a community called El Sa\u00edno de Pital located in the province of Alajuela. The community's primary productive activity is cattle farming and agriculture with an emphasis on the cultivation of pineapple, which is sold mostly in international markets. For this reason, the development of the community has been growing the last few years generating a large demand for the products and services which is helping mitigate the effect of immigration.\r\n\r\nCesar works in a pineapple exportation plant, but on his weekends and free days he works on his plantation which is on rented land. His wish is to overcome the need to work extra hours to have a better quality of life both for him and for his young daughter.\r\n\r\nThe micro credit loan he is asking for right now is for \u00a2530,000 (five hundred thirty thousand colones), to buy baby pineapple plants, fertilizers and different consumables to give the best maintenance and assistance possible to his crops. In the end he will be able to be rewarded and will have a much better production. \r\n\r\nC\u00e9sar is a member of the Empresa de Cr\u00e9dito Comunal Luz del Futuro Saino, one of the 100 member organizations of EDESA in Costa Rica. It will be his first loan and he requests it with the hope of continuing to grow both on a personal and economic level. Also, he emphasizes his thanks for this type of organization and all the credit facilitators that allow him to dedicate more time to productive activities. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

S. is a 62 year-old man who lives with his wife and his son in a community called Canalete, which is located in Upala in the Alajuela province.  It is a semi-mountainous area where the economic activities are centered on agriculture, primarily in livestock.  It is a community with a great potential for development and the establishment of small businesses, as much in agribusiness as in trade.\r\n\r\nCarlos has worked in the transportation sector for more than 15 years.  He drives around the community delivering merchandise with his truck.  His working days are long and tiring, but he says that he is thankful that he can continue to advance and to support his family.\r\n\r\nOwing to the many miles he has put on his truck, it has suffered different damages and is not in very good condition.  Carlos needs a loan of \u00a2675,000 (six hundred seventy-five thousand colones) to repair the truck and to buy the parts for his vehicle, since he cannot work effectively with the truck in its current condition.  \r\n\r\nCarlos is a member of the Canalete communal bank, which is one of the 100 organizations that are part of EDESA in Costa Rica.  This will be his first loan and with it he hopes to continue to grow both personally and economically and, in addition, to participate actively in the credit organization in his community.\r\n\r\n<br

Flor is a nurse technician and for a long time worked in her profession only to see that her wages did not meet the cost of raising her child as a single mother.  She decided to leave her job and look for a different way to make her living.  This is why she began selling spices (chili pepper, seasonings) in a market in her area.  Her business was big when she realized that in this business she made more than in her old job.  At the beginning, she only had a little half-meter wooden cart with little merchandise that, with much work, she managed to buy with her savings.  In the market she listens to her neighbor merchants about EDAPROSPO, and this is how they joined and formed the group VITA NOVA 2 years ago.  She is thankful to the organization because it is by means of the loans that have been increasing and are incredible to her that the little cart with which she started is now only a memory.  Now she has a big store, and sells not only spices but also meat, disposables, etc.  She is the best known in that area, so her profits are greater.  For her effort and sacrifice she has achieved many things, but the most important to her is that her son can follow a university career.  She also married, and helps her husband in the business he has as a tailor.  What she wants for the future is to invest in the textile business.  Her husband does it and knows that it is profitable.  They are saving up for the money they need to invest in this.  She will use the money from her current loan to buy spices and seasonings for her business because these days sales are going up.  Sra. Flor has strong faith and is grateful to God for all that she has received. She has worked hard to achieve everything else, and has always had a strong desire to do things the right way. \n\nSra.

One of them is in his fourth year of secondary school, and the other is 27 years old.  Martha has a cosmetic sales business, which she began four years ago with very little working capital, in search of an alternative source of income, since she also gives classes in a public school.  She began by selling just a few cosmetics.  Afterwards, she started to invest a little more.  This credit will be invested in the purchase of lipstick, polish, eyeshadow cases, and vanity boxes.  Since the Christmas season is approaching, she wants to invest and buy now, while the prices are a little lower.  Her goal is to eventually have a store with various items, that could be located in the market, which would provide economic facility to her and her two children.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

At first she only sold products from the catalog to her friends, which didn't leave her much profit.

She wants to be a director, which involves much effort because she has to prepare the sales people, assemble groups, and ensure that they have good sales. In addition to this, she studies about cosmetics and while undertaking her job also achieves other income working at home doing makeup, manicures, pedicures, hairstyling, etc. She offers her products to her customers there, and things are going well for her.

El Sauce se localiza aproximadamente a hora y media en bus de Turrialba, el centro de comercio m\u00e1s cercano. Sin embargo, varias veces al a\u00f1o el camino se vuelve intransitable por las lluvias que azotan la zona. Este es sin duda uno de los principales desaf\u00edos para la comunidad. \n\nCuando no exist\u00edan actividades muchas personas optaron por salir a buscar trabajos en Turrialba o en fincas bananeras ubicadas en la Zona Atl\u00e1ntica de Costa Rica. Actualmente los precios del caf\u00e9 y la leche han mejorado, por lo tanto los vecinos buscan c\u00f3mo invertir en proyectos en la misma zona y de esta forma evitar migrar.\n\nHace dos a\u00f1os, se instal\u00f3 en la comunidad una planta de elaboraci\u00f3n de quesos de la Asociaci\u00f3n de Productores de Leche de El Sauce. Por lo tanto, en los \u00faltimos dos a\u00f1os don Guido ha ido especializ\u00e1ndose en la producci\u00f3n de leche que luego vende a esta planta. \n\nDon Guido desea obtener un microcr\u00e9dito por \u00a2670.000(seiscientos setenta mil colones) para comprar m\u00e1s vacas y as\u00ed aumentar la producci\u00f3n de leche. El sabe que contar con m\u00e1s  vacas es un mayor sacrificio y demandar\u00e1 m\u00e1s trabajo pero dice que si quiere sacar su familia adelante tiene que esforzarse en producir m\u00e1s.\n\nActualmente don Guido orde\u00f1a en una peque\u00f1a instalaci\u00f3n de madera que acondicion\u00f3 como sala de orde\u00f1o. Dice que por d\u00eda logra producir aproximadamente 20 litros de leche y con m\u00e1s vacas su producci\u00f3n aumentar\u00eda a 70 litros diarios por lo cual esta muy emocionado de poder ver como su negocio crece y se fortalece.\n\nDon Guido es socio de la Asociaci\u00f3n de Productores de El Sauce, una de las 100 organizaciones socias de EDESA en Costa Rica. Este ser\u00e1 su noveno pr\u00e9stamo y con \u00e9l espera continuar creciendo a nivel personal y econ\u00f3mico. Tambi\u00e9n destaca que gracias a este tipo de organizaciones y medios facilitadores de cr\u00e9dito puede dedicar m\u00e1s tiempo a las actividades productivas. \n","en":"Guido V. J. is 37 years old. He lives with his wife and two children in a community called El Sauce in Santa Teresita de Turrialba, Province of Cartago. This is a small rural community with around two thousand people. They are work producing milk and growing coffee. It has an irregular terrain and a lot of it is maintained as humid tropical forest. The community has traditional landscapes that mix with the tropical forest, with two nice lagoons, coffee plantations and milk factories. El Sauce is located about an hour and a half from Turrialba, the closest commercial center. However, several times a year, the road is closed due to the heavy rain in the area. This is without a doubt one of the main challenges of the community.\r\nWhen there was nothing to do in town, a lot of people decided to go to Turrialba for work or to banana farms in the Atlantic coast in Costa Rica. Right now, coffee and milk prices have improves, so the neighbors are looking for ways to invest their money in the area and avoid migrations.\r\nTwo years ago, he installed a cheese manufacturing company in his community for the El Sauce\u2019s Milk Producer\u2019s Association. Therefore, Guido has been focusing in the production of milk during this time, that he later on sells to this plant.\r\nThis time, Guido would like to get a \u00a2670.00 loan (six hundred and seventy colones) to purchase more cows and increase the production of milk. He knows that having more cattle will imply greater sacrifices, but he wants to support his family so he's willing to make the effort.\r\nRight now, Guido milks his cows in a small wooden facility that we turned into a milking room. He says that he\u2019s able to produce around 20 liters of milk a day and with more cows his production will reach 70 liters, so he's very excited about seeing his business grow and get stronger.\r\n\r\nLuis is a member of the El Sauce Farmers Association, one of the 100 member organizations of EDESA in Costa Rica. This will be his ninth loan. He hopes to continue growing at a personal level and financial level. He also believes it\u2019s important to mention that thanks to these type of organizations he is able to devote more time to productive activities.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by

Es una peque\u00f1a comunidad rural de aproximadamente dos mil habitantes. Sus pobladores se dedican a la producci\u00f3n de leche y siembra de caf\u00e9. Tiene un relieve irregular y mucho del terreno se mantiene como bosque tropical h\u00famedo. La comunidad tiene paisajes muy pintorescos que combinan el bosque tropical con dos lindas lagunas, plantaciones de caf\u00e9 y lecher\u00edas. El Sauce se localiza aproximadamente a hora y media en bus de Turrialba, el centro de comercio m\u00e1s cercano. Sin embargo, varias veces al a\u00f1o el camino se vuelve intransitable por las lluvias que azotan la zona. Este es sin duda uno de los principales desaf\u00edos para la comunidad. \n\nCuando no exist\u00edan actividades muchas personas optaron por salir a buscar trabajos en Turrialba o en fincas bananeras ubicadas en la Zona Atl\u00e1ntica de Costa Rica. Actualmente los precios del caf\u00e9 y la leche han mejorado, por lo tanto los vecinos buscan c\u00f3mo invertir en proyectos en la misma zona y de esta forma evitar migrar.\n\nComo parte de las respuestas a esa situaci\u00f3n, desde hace dos a\u00f1os se instal\u00f3 en la comunidad una planta de elaboraci\u00f3n de quesos, propiedad de la Asociaci\u00f3n de Productores de Leche de El Sauce, hecho que motiv\u00f3 a do\u00f1a Carmen a iniciar en la producci\u00f3n de leche para luego venderla a esta planta. \n\nDo\u00f1a Carmen desea obtener un micro cr\u00e9dito de \u00a2500,000 (quinientos mil colones) para comprar una vaca lechera y poder iniciar con su negocio ya que quiere ser una microempresaria exitosa y  as\u00ed poder ayudar a sacar a su familia adelante esto es una de las cosas que la motiva a esforzarse y trabajar con mucho esmero. \n\nDo\u00f1a Carmen es socia de la Asociaci\u00f3n de Productores de El Sauce, una de las 100 organizaciones socias de EDESA en Costa Rica.

R. is 52 years old. She lives with her husband and their son in a community called El Sauce in Santa Teresita de Turrialba, Province of Cartago. This is a small rural community with around two thousand people. They are work producing milk and growing coffee. It has an irregular terrain and a lot of it is maintained as humid tropical forest. The community has traditional landscapes that mix with the tropical forest, with two nice lagoons, coffee plantations and milk factories. El Sauce is located about an hour and a half from Turrialba, the closest commercial center. However, several times a year, the road is closed due to the heavy rain in the area. This is without a doubt one of the main challenges of the community.\r\nWhen there was nothing to do in town, a lot of people decided to go to Turrialba for work or to banana farms in the Atlantic coast in Costa Rica. Right now, coffee and milk prices have improves, so the neighbors are looking for ways to invest their money in the area and avoid migrations.\r\nDue to this situation, two years ago, a cheese manufacturing company was installed in her community for the El Sauce\u2019s Milk Producer\u2019s Association. This motivated her to begin producing milk to resell it to the plant.\r\nThis time, Carmen would like to get a \u00a2500.00 loan (five hundred colones) to purchase a milking cow and start her own business. She wants to be a successful entrepreneur to help her family. This motivates her to make sacrifices and work hard.\r\n\r\nCarmen is a member of the El Sauce Farmers Association, one of the 100 member organizations of EDESA in Costa Rica. This will be his ninth loan. She hopes to continue growing at a personal level and financial level. She also believes it\u2019s important to mention that thanks to these type of organizations she is able to devote more time to productive activities.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jimena

G. is 43 years old. He lives with his wife and son in a community called El Sauce in Santa Teresita de Turrialba, Province of Cartago. This is a small rural community with around two thousand people. They are work producing milk and growing coffee. It has an irregular terrain and a lot of it is maintained as humid tropical forest. The community has traditional landscapes that mix with the tropical forest, with two nice lagoons, coffee plantations and milk factories. El Sauce is located about an hour and a half from Turrialba, the closest commercial center. However, several times a year, the road is closed due to the heavy rain in the area. This is without a doubt one of the main challenges of the community.\r\nWhen there was nothing to do in town, a lot of people decided to go to Turrialba for work or to banana farms in the Atlantic coast in Costa Rica. Right now, coffee and milk prices have improves, so the neighbors are looking for ways to invest their money in the area and avoid migrations.\r\nFray is a milk producer. This way he obtains an income to support his family. He says he's very happy because due to this project he has been able to make a living. He sells his milk to the cheese manufacturing company that works for the El Sauce\u2019s Milk Producer\u2019s Association.\r\nFray would like to get a \u00a2640.00 loan (six hundred and forty colones) to purchase a milking cow and increase the production of milk. He wants to be a successful entrepreneur to help his family. This motivates him to make sacrifices and work hard.\r\n\r\nFray is a member of the El Sauce Farmers Association, one of the 100 member organizations of EDESA in Costa Rica. This will be his first loan. He hopes to continue growing at a personal level and financial level. He also believes it\u2019s important to mention that thanks to these type of organizations she is able to devote more time to productive activities.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by

He lives in the city of Olmos, located about an hour from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nSix years ago he began making and selling ice cream. Thanks to his hard work, he was able to make a living out of his business. He began selling his products in small quantities, but now he's become a producer.

G. is from the city of San Luis, Tarlac. She is 47 years old. Aura is married and has seven school-aged children. To make a living, Aura runs a general store, selling a variety of different products in the local community. Aura has been engaged in her business for over 18 years and earns approximately $150 a month from this activity.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Aura joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Aura has successfully repaid a previous loan of 50,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to invest in expanding her business. Aura is requesting a new loan of 50,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be her 3rd loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue to expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful micro-finance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":452545,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

M. is from the city of Balibago 1st, Tarlac. He is 56 years old. Amado is widowed and has four adult children. To make a living, Amado sells purified\/mineral water in the local community. Amado has been engaged in his business for over four years and earns approximately $750 a month from this activity.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Amado joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Amado has successfully repaid a previous loan of 50,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase a transport vehicle to help in the business. Amado is requesting a new loan of 50,000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be his 3rd loan from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue to further develop his business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful micro-finance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from providing dress making services to local community members. Teresita has been engaged in her business for over 13 years and earns approximately 4000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, Teresita joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Teresita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional fabrics & materials. Teresita is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP which will be used to purchase used sewing machine. This loan will be the tenth loan taken out by Teresita from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb is a 36 year-old woman living in the town of Y\u00ean Phong - B\u1eafc Ninh.  \r\n\r\nL.  is the group leader of a five-member group loan offered by SEDA.  While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.  The official name of this borrowing group is An Nhinh 1 (An Ninh nh\u00f3m 07).\r\n\r\nL.  is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, L.  owns and operates a tailoring business. The main source of income for the business comes from providing general alterations and tailoring services to local community members. L.  has been engaged in this business for over ten years and earns approximately 3, 000, 000 Viet Nam Dong (VND) a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, L.  joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  L.  has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4,704, 000 VND from SEDA.  This previous loan was used to purchase additional fabrics and materials.  She is now requesting a new loan of 6,048,000 VND which will be used to purchase additional fabrics and materials. The loan will be the third loan L. has taken out from SEDA.  L.  plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\nAbout the Other Borrowers in the Group:\r\n\r\n1.  D\u01b0\u01a1ng Th\u1ecb N. is a 26 year-old woman who is requesting a 5,152,000 VND loan to support her business raising livestock.\r\n\r\n2.  Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb N.

Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\nL.

Nga has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4.704.000 VND from SEDA.  This previous loan was used to purchase livestock feed & other supplies.  She is now requesting a new loan of 7.392.000 VND which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise & sell in the future.  The loan will be the 4th loan Nga has taken out with SEDA.

Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb is a 41 year-old female living in the town of Y\u00ean Phong - B\u1eafc Ninh.  She is married and has 2 school-aged children.  To making a living, S. owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising cattle for sale.  S. has been engaged in this business for over 12 years and earns approximately 2.000.000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2008, S. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  S. has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4.704.000 VND from SEDA.  This previous loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise & sell.  S. is now requesting a new loan of 6.048.000 VND which will be used to purchase more baby livestock to raise & sell.  The loan will be the 3rd loan she has taken out with SEDA.  S. plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout SEDA:\r\n\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to the low income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the Northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva

Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb is a 35 year-old female living in the town of Y\u00ean Phong - B\u1eafc Ninh.  H. is the group leader of a 3-member group loan offered by SEDA.  While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.  The official name of this borrowing group is Tr\u00e1c B\u00fat 1 - nh\u00f3m 01.\r\n\r\n\r\nH. is married and has 2 school-aged children.  To making a living, H. owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting and harvesting fruits & vegetables for sale.  H. has been engaged in this business for over 7 years and earns approximately 3.600.000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2007, H. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  H. has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4.256.000 VND from SEDA.  This previous loan was used to purchase fertilizers such as manure.  She is now requesting a new  loan of 4.256.000 VND which will be used to purchase general farm supplies & equipment.  The loan will be the 4th loan she has taken out with SEDA.  H. plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support extended members of her family.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the Other Borrowers in the Group:\r\n\r\n\r\n1.  M\u1eabn Th\u1ecb N. is a 33 year-old female who is requesting a 2.912.000 VND loan to support her business in the agriculture sector raising livestock.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.

Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva

She lives peacefully at home with her husband Jhonny, who is 40 years old, and their three children:  Bryan (age 14), Jimena (age 6), and Florentino (age 10 months).  They live in a cramped house that they own in the mountains of Peru.\r\n<p>\r\nShe is a very hardworking woman who spends most of her day attending to her business from a rented location.  Nineteen years ago, Blanca decided to start a beauty salon where she honed her manual skills for styling the hair of clients who seek her services.  There are no other similar businesses like hers in the area, so she is able to generate very good revenues.\r\n<p>\r\nBlanca enjoys working at her salon, but she also manages to have time to look after her children.  A few months ago, she bought a few decorations to sell from her salon.  She keeps these items in a small display case, which was the start of a small bazaar.  Over time, this part of her business has grown as well.  She is able to cope with having two businesses because it allows her to stay ahead and provide the best for her family.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis is her first loan with MFP.  Blanca is very confident that she will be responsible in making each of her payments on time because she does not want to cause problems for the other members.  Her Communal Bank is a very organized group.  Blanca will use the loan to purchase equipment for her beauty salon to make her customers feel more comfortable.  In addition, she will buy merchandise for her decoration sales business.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":452976,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","use":"Purchase equipment for her beauty salon & decorations to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-12-21T01:20:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Blanca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":63,"local_amount":180,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-26T10:01:30Z","rounded_local_amount":181.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734984,"comment":null},{"amount":112,"local_amount":320,"processed_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:06Z","rounded_local_amount":322.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172153765,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-12-21T04:48:11Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":163821,"name":"Brisayda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Brisayda, es el nombre de esta trabajadora y dedicada mujer, que a sus 29 a\u00f1os vive con su esposo (Dante), de tambi\u00e9n 29 a\u00f1os, y con su hijo Johan de 4 a\u00f1os.

She gets up very early to look after her little ones, get them ready for school and then start work. Sometimes life shows us just how much a mother is capable of doing for the wellbeing of her children.

After separating from her husband, she began to work at a bakery where her mother worked. She mixes the ingredients to make delicious baked goods that are a real temptation. She likes her work; she is a willing worker and earns a good wage, which enables her to maintain her children and pay for their education since she wants them to have what she couldn't have: a profession.\r\nLooking to the future, Maria plans to open a bakery with her mother, and make it the best bakery in the area; she has great aspirations and a strong desire to succeed.\r\nThis is her sixth loan from MFP, and she will repay it punctually, as she has in the past, so as not to let down the members of the community bank.

Haidee has been engaged in her business for over eight years and earns approximately $62 a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Haidee joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation by engaging in business activities. Haidee has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Haidee is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase new items to add to her products for sale. This will be her 3rd loan from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

He lives with his 30 year old wife, Haydee, and their two children.  Jefferson is five, and Renzo is only one month old.  They are very happy together, and they have the desire to get ahead.  They live in a cozy house, which is their own.  It is located in a peaceful area in the mountain ranges of Per\u00fa.\r\n\r\nAlberto remembers since he was very small how his parents planted on the land where he innocently played.  From then on, he learned everything a man of the fields should know.  He now devotes himself to agriculture.  He gets up very early everyday to take care of his potato and \u201colluco\u201d (Peruvian tuber) crops.  With their sale he is able to pay the family\u2019s expenses.\r\n\r\nHe currently plants and also maintains his fields alone and without help.  He considers agricultural work to be very profitable.  The harvest produces plenty, and he can also put into practice the knowledge he learned since he was small.\r\n\r\nWhat Alberto wants most is to give his children and his wife the best.  His wife also helps him in her free time.\r\n\r\nThis is his sixth loan with MFP.  He promises to be punctual and responsible in each of his payments.  He does not like to create problems for the other members of his Communal Bank.  They work to improve everyday.  He will use the money he is asking for to buy compost, fertilizers, and insecticides for the care and treatment of his land in order to get a good harvest. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":453342,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Buy compost and fertilizers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-12-21T14:40:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alberto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":425}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":425,"local_amount":1200,"processed_date":"2010-07-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:36Z","rounded_local_amount":1224,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159672749,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-12-21T16:10:25Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":163853,"name":"Jeffrey","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jeffrey G. is from the village of Barangay Tucal, Solano, Nueva Vizcaya.

He is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used for the repair and maintenance of his motorcycle used in his business. This loan will be his second loan taken from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support the immediate members of his family. \n\n\nAbout ASKI:\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

Tunbaun is situated about 23 kilometres from Kupang City. Most of the village community consumes corn and cassava as their staple food. The agricultural products also generate money for their family needs. The agricultural products are sold at Baun Market in the nearest neighboring village and also in Inpres Market in Kupang City. The view surrounding the village is beautiful as many trees and wild flowers grow well in the rainy season. The village seems green.\r\n\r\nKisan A Group is led by Damaris Runisi.  She is a 47 year-old farmer. She is married to a farmer from her village and their marriage has been blessed with three children. They are:\r\n- Devri Runisi, 17 \u2013 who is now working in Jakarta;\r\n- Dance Runisi, 14  \u2013 he did not complete elementary school and spends his days helping his parents on the farm;\r\n- Ayub Runisi, 10, who is in the fourth grade of Elementary School. \r\n\r\nDamaris is a good mother to her children and her life is dedicated to her family. She usually starts her day at five am.  She prepares breakfast for her children and husband and helps Ayub in preparing himself to go to school. Damaris has to walk about one kilometre to reach a spring in order to get water for washing and cooking. Using two buckets, Damaris carries the water on her shoulders. After completing her work at home she goes to the farm to help her husband. They usually spend about six hours on the farm. They plant coconut, betel vine and bananas and sell them in Inpres Market once a week. They also plant peanuts, peas, cassavas and corn in the rainy season. To generate more income, Damaris\u2019 husband also buys vegetables and fruits from other farmers and resells them at the market. Damaris used to own another farm but because of landslide lost her land. As a result, she and her family can only depend on their current farm.\r\n\r\nAs the mother of three children, Damaris is concerned about her family. Her husband is a hard worker but the income he generates is only just enough to support their family needs. This is the reason that motivated Damaris to find another way to support her family. She heard about the TLM cattle fattening program and would like to join it.  Together with other farmers also interested in joining the program, they formed Kisan A Group to apply for the loan. Damaris is requesting a loan of IDR 3,300,000 to buy a calf to fatten over a 12 month period. The other group members are also requesting the same loan.

Sometimes they need to buy more agricultural products from other farmers but fortunately they can buy it at a cheaper price.\r\n\r\nErny dreams of running a kiosk business so she can help her husband generate more income but she does not have the capital to start the business. One day she heard from a Field Officer that TLM can help poor farmers like her through the Cattle Fattening Program.

Erny is requesting a loan of IDR 3,300,000 from TLM to buy young cattle to fatten over twelve months. The other members of Kisan B group are also requesting loans to buy young cattle.
