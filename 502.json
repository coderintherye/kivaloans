D., age 22, engages in a fishing business. She goes out in a fishing boat to catch assorted fish, which she then sells at market. \r\n\r\nGemalyn joined CEVI to gain access to financial services. She hoped to help improve her living situation and increase her ability to engage in business activities. Gemalyn has successfully repaid a previous loan  from CEVI. Gemalyn is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase fishing equipment, including hooks and nets.

La intensa temporada invernal que azota a la ciudad le ha ocasionado disminuci\u00f3n en las ventas y dificultad para movilizarse, pero se muestra optimista por la cercan\u00eda del verano y la temporada navide\u00f1a que es la mejor del a\u00f1o. El se\u00f1or Rafael tiene tres hijos que le apoyan totalmente en su negocio porque genera ingresos para su hogar y sobretodo porque la actividad f\u00edsica lo mantiene en un perfecto estado de salud.","en":"Rafael T. is a happy and healthy 81 year-old man who sells clothes, footwear and small electrical appliances.  He has been in this business since 1996, the year he first joined Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, from whom he has now received 10 loans.\r\n\r\nThis small businessman's customers are mainly his pensioner friends.  Rafael says that he loves his work because it allows him to remain active and above all it allows him to visit many stores and shopping centers in search of sales promotions.  His monthly sales volume is on average $2,00,000 and his profit margin is between 30% and 35%.  He generally gives his customers 30 \u2013 45 days to pay for their goods in 2 or 3 instalments.\r\n\r\nRafael plans to invest this Kiva loan in buying men's clothes and footwear.  His plans for the not-so-distant future are to open his own premises where he can sell his products and chat with his customers who are also his friends.  The cold winter season which has been hitting the city has caused his sales to fall and also made it difficult to get around but he is optimistic about the approaching summer and the Christmas period which is the best season of the year.  Rafael has three children who support him completely in his business because it makes income for his household and, above all, because the physical activity keeps him in a perfect state of health."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":649206,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To buy

Con su experiencia de 12 a\u00f1os fue como naci\u00f3 su gran empresa,  que hoy  cuenta con dos operarias y sus l\u00edneas principales son la  femenina  y masculina; Margenis  tiene una clientela fija ubicada en su natal Pueblo Viejo  y tambi\u00e9n en Barranquilla en estas dos partes, vende sus dise\u00f1os mediante cr\u00e9dito, de acuerdo a sus posibilidades y a las de sus clientes; tiene adem\u00e1s un contrato con una importante empresa a quien le confecciona y recupera su inversi\u00f3n a los 45 d\u00edas.

She then moved to Barranquilla where she married and had two children who are now 8 and 12 years old.\r\n\r\nMargenis makes clothes.  She started her business when she lost her job in the free-trade zone in Barranquilla.  She started work as a general services assistant and rose to become head of quality and design, while she trained in everything related to clothes making and perfected her skills through her formal job.\r\n\r\nWith 12 years of experience, she started her business which today employs two workers.  Her main lines are women's and men's clothing.  Margenis has regular customers in her home town of Pueblo Nuevo and also in Barranquilla.  She sells her designs in these two places.  She sells on credit according to her own situation and that of her customers.  She also has a contract with an important company for which she makes clothing and recovers her investment in 45 days.\r\n\r\nWhen Margenis started her business she bought her machinery on credit and paid back bit by bit until it was completely paid for.  Although she started her business 4 years ago, she made it fully legal 2 years ago so that she could access more formal markets.\r\n\r\nThis Kiva loan is Margenis' first one with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She will use it to buy raw materials and supplies such as fabric, threads, sheepskin and zippers so that she can fill the orders which she has.  Her production process is: designing, cutting, preparing, assembling, filleting and quality control.  She will make women's outfits to sell and hopes to make profits of approximately 25% on that activity so that she can continue to grow and reinvest in this December period which sees sales increase for all businesses.\r\n\r\nMargenis' greatest dream is to turn her business into a well-known, haute couture workshop with many employees and her own premises.  Her main challenge is the lack of capital when there are many orders to fill.  However, she always devises some way of recovering her wallet and being able to manage with what she recovers.  Fulfilling her dream depends on the money that she manages to get hold of and leverage.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":643840,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"To buy fabric, threads, sheepskin and zippers so that she can fill her orders","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2010-11-24T15:00:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Margenis Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":69159},{"due_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":76235},{"due_date":"2011-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":77696},{"due_date":"2011-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":79185},{"due_date":"2011-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":80703},{"due_date":"2011-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":82250},{"due_date":"2011-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":83826},{"due_date":"2011-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":85433},{"due_date":"2011-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":87070},{"due_date":"2011-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":88739},{"due_date":"2011-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":90440},{"due_date":"2011-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":99264}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.04},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.93},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.73},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.55},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.39},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.24},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.1},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.99},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.89},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.8},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.74},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.6}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":38.04,"local_amount":69159,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:39:04Z","rounded_local_amount":71898.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191427700,"comment":null},{"amount":41.93,"local_amount":76235,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-16T08:40:28Z","rounded_local_amount":79254.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196001121,"comment":null},{"amount":86.28,"local_amount":156881,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:08:08Z","rounded_local_amount":163095.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201289133,"comment":null},{"amount":89.62,"local_amount":162953,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:17:53Z","rounded_local_amount":169407.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211230286,"comment":null},{"amount":46.11,"local_amount":83826,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:50:27Z","rounded_local_amount":87146.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221673379,"comment":null},{"amount":46.99,"local_amount":85433,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:02:34Z","rounded_local_amount":88817,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227319941,"comment":null},{"amount":47.89,"local_amount":87070,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:06:27Z","rounded_local_amount":90518.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232803094,"comment":null},{"amount":48.8,"local_amount":88739,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:17:05Z","rounded_local_amount":92253.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238614186,"comment":null},{"amount":104.34,"local_amount":189704,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:59:15Z","rounded_local_amount":197218.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244568179,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-11-25T15:41:05Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T09:59:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":251725,"name":"Takussan Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Le groupe de solidarit\u00e9 TAKUSSAN est cr\u00e9\u00e9 le 19 d\u00e9cembre 2001.

She also has a business selling a variety of merchandise such as clothing, footwear, cosmetics, fancy clothing and in general,  anything that her customers order.

She has increased her income, her profit margin is 28%, and she projects that her profit margin will increase to  32% with this new loan.  This is due to an increase in sales for the holiday season, a time when sales pick up and consequently,   there is an injection of working capital because of cash purchases.  This Kiva loan is her seventh credit with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo with which she will buy fancy clothing, cosmetics, and clothing that she ordered for the end of the year.  Her dreams and greatest challenges are to have her own house, to continue prospering in her business, bringing energy to her commercial activities and with the financial support that she receives with the loans, to be able to increase her working capital that is currently $2,280,000

Tras haber trabajo por muchos a\u00f1os, en f\u00e1bricas de zapatos como ayudante, con mucho esfuerzo, Elizabeth logr\u00f3 instalar su taller de zapatos, en el interior de su casa, en la que trabaja en sociedad con su hermano. Desde entonces ya llevan 4 a\u00f1os en esta actividad, en la que ella con mucho esmero y dedicaci\u00f3n, realiza las costuras respectivas de los zapatos, mientras que su hermano arma y le da los retoques respetivos a los calzados que fabrican, por lo que les va muy bien en esta labor. Su mayor goce, es cuando sus calzados tienen mucha aceptaci\u00f3n en el mercado y le hacen m\u00e1s pedidos. En adelante, anhela fabricar zapatos para eventos elegantes, pero ahora solo fabrica zapatos casuales. Este es su segundo cr\u00e9dito con MFP, en la que se compromete en pagar todas las cuotas oportunamente, ya que desea m\u00e1s adelante acceder a nuevos pr\u00e9stamos.

Separated from her husband since several years ago, she lives in her mother's house together with her 4-year-old son Fabricio. For many years, Elizabeth had worked at shoe factories as an assistant, and with a lot of effort, she was able to set up her own shoe-manufacturing workshop at home, where she now works with her brother. \r\n\r\nThey've been working together in this business for four years now. With great care and dedication, Elizabeth does all the sewing work while her brother assembles the shoes and puts the finishing touches. They work together well in this venture, and Elizabeth's greatest joy is when their shoes find success in the marketplace and customers come to them with more orders.  \r\n\r\nIn the future, Elizabeth would really like to make formal footwear, but for now she is making casual shoes. This is her second loan with MFP, and she is committed to make all the repayments in a timely manner since she wishes to have access to credit in the future. Elizabeth will use the current loan to buy leather, flannel, lining, and other materials for manufacturing summer shoes; she already has new orders and wants to fulfill them.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":650059,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"Purchase of leather, flannel, and lining for manufacturing shoes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:27Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elizabeth ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":256.37},{"due_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":258.85},{"due_date":"2011-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":274.41},{"due_date":"2011-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":289.24},{"due_date":"2011-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":291.86},{"due_date":"2011-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":304.36},{"due_date":"2011-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":313.43},{"due_date":"2011-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":325.98},{"due_date":"2011-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":336.58},{"due_date":"2011-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":348.92}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.87},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.75},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.65},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.58},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.06},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.31},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.81},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.61},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.03}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":91.87,"local_amount":256.37,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:05:15Z","rounded_local_amount":258.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188725423,"comment":null},{"amount":92.75,"local_amount":258.85,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:41:17Z","rounded_local_amount":260.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191463521,"comment":null},{"amount":98.33,"local_amount":274.41,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:52:45Z","rounded_local_amount":276.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195886903,"comment":null},{"amount":103.65,"local_amount":289.24,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:37:08Z","rounded_local_amount":291.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201327257,"comment":null},{"amount":104.58,"local_amount":291.86,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:32:05Z","rounded_local_amount":293.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206195827,"comment":null},{"amount":109.06,"local_amount":304.36,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:41:44Z","rounded_local_amount":306.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211269487,"comment":null},{"amount":112.31,"local_amount":313.43,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:33:46Z","rounded_local_amount":315.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216549541,"comment":null},{"amount":112.09,"local_amount":312.81,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:12:54Z","rounded_local_amount":314.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221718268,"comment":null},{"amount":125.33,"local_amount":349.75,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:14:04Z","rounded_local_amount":352.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227349872,"comment":null},{"amount":125.03,"local_amount":348.92,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:47:48Z","rounded_local_amount":351.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232850438,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-12-01T20:04:48Z","paid_date":"2011-10-15T09:47:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":251774,"name":"Rosa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nLa socia pertenece al banco comunal \u201cLLANKACHINAPAC\u201d; El banco est\u00e1 ubicado en el distrito de Urubamba, perteneciente a la provincia de Urubamba  y departamento de Cusco.\nLa socia es la Sra.

In addition, he rents out Internet booths in his house during his spare time and operates the business with the help of his oldest child who is the primary manager.  Julio says his Internet business generates good profits.  For this reason, he plans to improve his facilities in the future and purchase more computers since there is no competition in the area.  He also plans to start a small call center so that he can expand his business even more.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis is his sixth loan with MFP.  Julio promises to submit his payments on time because he does not want to look bad in the eyes of those who made this loan possible so that he could continue working and making progress.  He plans to invest this loan in improvements to his Internet business.  Julio will paint his establishment and furnish it in order to make his customers more comfortable.

It was a very difficult time for her as, after the death of her husband, all the responsibilities came down on her shoulders. She recovered her senses for her children and raised them very well. Now both sons have their own business. Both of her sons operate a Punjabi food resturant. They offer a variety of food such as Nan chanay (made with chickpeas and served with bread) and Biryani (made with rice, chicken and served with yogurt and salad) and tea to their clients. They are very good people and have good business knowledge. They have an ability to attract customers with their good customer dealings and the quality of their food. \r\n\r\nMehmoodan has applied for a loan from Kiva partner Asasah for her sons business. With the loan, they will buy required items such as chickpeas, spices, cooking oil, rice & chicken in bulk quantities that will help them providing better quality services and food to their customers. \r\n\r\nMehmoodan is hopeful that an investment will make her sons business more profitable and will also expand their business on larger scale.

They have nine children, but only three still live with them: Gerson aged 14, Ursula aged 12, and Jordan aged 10. The family lives in their own house located in the community of Sanchirio in the rainforest of central Peru.\r\n\r\nRita earns her living through farming. Every morning she and her husband Julio set off to work in their coffee, banana, and yucca fields. \r\nThey apply fertilizer on a regular basis as well as care for the crops. Rita\u2019s greatest pleasure is seeing the crops grow and develop satisfactorily, then being rewarded by a good harvest, and finally gratefully receiving the income from the produce.\r\n\r\nHer main customers are from the same area where she lives, as in her 20 years of experience she has developed good contacts who know the quality of her products. For this reason she is thinking of improving production to obtain more income. This is her first loan with Kiva partner MFP, and she is grateful for the opportunity offered by her community bank to better her prospects. Rita is planning to use the money to buy several bags of fertilizer to spread on the coffee plants.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":650216,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy bags of fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-11-24T22:30:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:47:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1053.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232850445,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-11-25T03:25:15Z","paid_date":"2011-10-15T09:47:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":251838,"name":"Maria Guadalupe","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda, tiene 28 a\u00f1os D. edad, resiD. en San Francisco Gotera, administra una tienda donD. ofrece art\u00edculos D. primera necesidad, ella vive junto a su esposo, y su hijo Cesar D. 4 a\u00f1os D. edad, su esposo trabaja en una agencia D. viajes juntos velan por el bienestar del hogar.\nEste negocio fue iniciativa propia como una alternativa para tener ingresos y crecer econ\u00f3micamente, lo tienen en su propia casa y el horario para vender no es fijo; actualmente solicitan un pr\u00e9stamo para la compra D. mercader\u00eda para el negocio como arroz, az\u00facar, ma\u00edz, frijoles y aceite, con el dinero D. este pr\u00e9stamo ellos estar\u00e1n adquiriendo todo lo que necesitan para ofrecer a los clientes y tener la oportunidad D. mejorar sus ingresos.\nSu principal proyecto es que su negocio cuente con la mercader\u00eda que demandan los clientes, que sea prospero y que le ayuD. a cubrir las necesidades del hogar, que su hijo crezca sano con todo lo necesario para su desarrollo.\n","en":"Mar\u00eda is 28 years old and lives in San Francisco Gotera.

Since he was a child his parents taught him all he had to learn to sow and since then he enjoyed the time he spent in the field helping his parents. Four years ago he acquired agricultural land where he could finally start his own production of crops.  He cultivates coffee, banana and pineapple, and with every harvest, sells them at a good price in your local cooperative.  He sells the fruits to intermediaries who constantly visit the central market of their city. As he has little time in agriculture, he wants to continue growing and improving the quality of crops.  This is the first loan with MFP, and the invitation he received from the local communal bank was very good as he needed support to achieve his objectives. This is why he has already thought about investing the loan in the purchase of 4 thousand coffee plants to begin the renovation of his agricultural land. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":650240,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase 4,000 coffee plants","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-11-24T23:40:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luis ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:48:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1053.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232850448,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-11-25T02:29:24Z","paid_date":"2011-10-15T09:48:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":251847,"name":"Jovita Del Carmen","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jovita de 62 a\u00f1os, tiene una peque\u00f1a tienda, vive en una zona periurbana con todos los servicios b\u00e1sicos el lugar est\u00e1 ubicado en la Perimetral de Guayaquil zona rodeada de un estero.  \n\nInicio su negocio comprando pocos productos para poder mantener a sus hijos ya que es madre soltera.

He is a single and hard-working man who lives with his mother in his own home in the community of Sanchirio (in the central Peruvian jungle).  This young, dynamic man has been farming for 8 years.  His main crops are coffee and bananas.\r\n\r\nOver the years, Reyner has cared for his land.  He has managed to achieve many things, including buying his own plot of land which meant he was able to invest more capital in his crops.  However, what he most likes doing is selling his crops because he then sees the results of all his hard work in front of him.  Most of the traders in the city's wholesale market know Reyner and they comment that he is a good farmer and they recognize the quality of his coffee beans.

After a while, they decided to print custom t-shirts for other businesses.  One business asked them \u201cdo you do banners too?\u201d  And they said \u201cof course!\u201d even though they hadn\u2019t made banners before and did not have the necessary equipment. \u201cAnytime they ask me something, I say \u2018of course\u2019 and I start doing it \u2013 and with a lot of success! \u2026 in that fashion, little by little, we grew.  That\u2019s why they say that this is a good business.\u201d \r\n\r\nNow they can print business cards in an hour or two.  \u201cWe\u2019re very fast.  \u2026 We\u2019ll stay up all night if we need to.  If we resolve our clients\u2019 problems, they\u2019ll return or recommend us.\u201d It takes a while the first time they create a new product, though, because they have to buy materials and access machinery.  \u201cMy intention is to do everything in-house\u201d.\r\n\r\nRicardo L. and his wife plan to use this loan to stock up on raw materials, such as rolls of vinyl or rolls of magnetic sheets to print on and cartridges of ink and toner for the machines. He always wants to have materials in stock so \u201cI never have to think \u2018I have to buy this, and that, and that.\u2019  So I can think about service and quality - not spend my time on thinking \u2018I have to buy\u2019.  You just buy it and then you\u2019re set.\u201d\r\n\r\nWithout this loan, Ricardo thinks his business would continue to function, but it would have delayed their goals.  \r\n\r\nRicardo and his wife would like to be able to support more people.  \u201cWe want to give employment to people \u2013 to sustain many families.  That\u2019s always what we\u2019ve had in mind.  We don\u2019t want to be rich; we would rather make it so people have something they can live off of.  We would also like to be very organized, and expand.  It\u2019s been a dream for many years to have many offices in other cities.\u201d\r\n\r\nAbout two years ago, Ricardo and Marielos moved the business out of their garage.  \u201cThese have been the two most difficult years for the economy, but we\u2019ve grown!  It\u2019s a blessing for us.  The most difficult times are when you can put yourself to the test and prove your potential.\u201d\r\n\r\nThat success is also passed on to his children. \u201cI\u2019m proud that people recognize my business every time as having high quality and good service. And of the lessons that it leaves for my children \u2013 it\u2019s important.  When you have your own business, your horizon is very large.  Every day is an opportunity to do business.  And the children learn that way of thinking.\u201d\r\n\r\nRicardo has three children. Ricky is in his third year of studying civil engineering, Odette plans to study architecture when she goes to college next year, and Dhais is in high school.\r\n\r\nBorn in Chicago, Ricardo grew up in Monterrey, Mexico.  He returned to the United States 11 years ago.\r\n\r\nRicardo describes himself as a very honest family man with a lot of faith. He said he \u201cgives thanks to God for what I\u2019m living.  That my business is successful.  That everything is going well with the business and with my marriage.\u201d\r\n\r\nRicardo describes his marriage and business as \u201ca partnership where each of us do what we know best how to do.  She knows how to manage money.  And I know well how to do the work with high quality.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe advice Ricardo would like to give to other business owners is to \u201cmake the client feel like this business is for them; make them feel comfortable.  It doesn\u2019t matter if the business is tiny or huge; treat them well.  You never know which small business will grow huge, and if you treat them well when they\u2019re small they\u2019ll stick with you.\u201d

This is reflected in his 3 hours dedicating himself to the noble labor of farming, with his main crops being coffee and banana.  He cleans and cares for the plants every morning in order to sell them later to the buyers that constantly visit the area.  Edgar is already well-known by these buyers, and he wants to buy more land to plant more, and thus to have a greater income.  This is his third loan with MFP, and he is happy with the mutual help that his communal bank gives, thanks to which he can work with more peace of mind.  He plans on using this loan to buy organic fertilizer and, money permitting, to hire help to remove weeds from his fields."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":650297,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Buy bags of organic fertilizer and hire people to remove weeds from his fields","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:28Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edgar ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":550,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:49:06Z","rounded_local_amount":1544.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232850455,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-12-08T17:12:13Z","paid_date":"2011-10-15T09:49:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":251878,"name":"Laura Mariela","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Se\u00f1orita.

She is married and has two children aged 18 and 21 years old.  She has been in business since a young age when she arrived in Barranquilla with the dream of completing Higher education studies, but as she was unable to pay for them she decided to work in a clothing department store where she gained her experience.  Once her first child was born she left her job and, using her social security benefits, she fulfilled her dream of being a businesswoman. She strengthened her business with financing from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, an organisation which allowed her to extend her physical infrastructure and increase her stock levels, and so increase her client base. She tells us that when she started her business in 1992, she had no capital to supply as she had invested it in buying the shop and two glass cabinets, so she went to her sister-in-law who worked as a machine operator in a clothing factory. Mabel bought materials and supplies and worked according to the designs suggested by her sister-in-law. In 1996 she joined the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo group, an organisation which has lent her a hand ever since. She started out with $300,000 COP and today she is applying for a loan of $1,400,000 COP, via Kiva, which is the eighth loan that she will have had from this organisation. With the loan she will purchase a laptop computer to record her finances and manage the administration of her small business, which is already well structured and with this piece of equipment she will improve the way that she manages her time. Mabel Rodr\u00edguez feels that she is a very successful woman and has achieved this with the support of her family, and due to her capacity for resistance when faced with adversities while working in good faith. This has allowed her to improve the quality of her family's life and strengthen her free, independent and self-sufficient spirit.  Her dream is to have an office to build her stock rotation and increase her profits.  Mabel says that her business has taught her to manage her profits so that new trends in fashion do not put her out of business, because her classic styles appeal to a special type of women and girls attending special parties such as first grade communions and very formal events.

Three of her children have their own families and the other four have stable work and help her. \r\n\r\nPaterna joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 6 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Paterna has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 17000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 20000 which improved the family's standard of living. This time, for her 7th loan, she is borrowing PHP 17000, which she intends to use to buy more product to sell so that she can continue to save for the future. Paterna B. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\"). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them \"dungganon,\" a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Her husband Danny B., who is 39 years old, is an overseas contract worker. They have two children who are 15 and 16 years old. \r\n\r\nAnacleta joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 11 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Anacleta has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 30000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 12th loan, she is borrowing PHP 18000, to buy fishing materials so that she can continue to save for the future and expand her business. Anacleta B. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

She earns her living by operating a business distributing herbal products. Her husband, Rogelio, who is 57 years old, works as an X-ray Technologist to earn his living, and he also helps in his wife's business activities. \r\n<p>\r\nAntonia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007, because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past three loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Antonia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 10,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 5500 PHP, raising her family's standard of living. This time, for her fourth loan, she is borrowing 15,000 PHP, which she intends to use in purchasing herbal products to sell. She plans to continue saving up for the future education of her niece and nephew.\r\n<p>\r\nAntonia F. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout NWTF: <br>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than 1 USD a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Pasil, EB Magalona, Negros Occidental. He earns his living operating a fishing business.  His wife Mary Grace, 32, works as a vendor and also helps in her husband\u2019s fishing activities. They have three children who are between three and eight years old. \r\n\r\nAllan joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because he aspired for something better for his family. With the help of his past nine loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Allan has been incrementally lifting his family out of poverty by the sweat of his brow. His previous loan of 18,000 PHP helped him earn a monthly profit of 11,500 PHP, raising his family's standard of living.  This time, for his tenth loan, he is borrowing 15,000 PHP, which he intends to use to purchase fishing gear and equipment so that he can continue to save up for the future education of his children. Allan G. is a Dungganon man who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of his dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She lives in Purok 4, Brgy. Bongalonan, Basay, Negros Oriental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2008 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her motorcycle transport (habal-habal) and rice dealing businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of 6,500 PHP. Jocelyn is now borrowing 15,000 PHP so that she can continue to fund the operations of her motorcycle transport business. This will be her fourth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 5,000 PHP, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Jocelyn aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Media Once, Toledo City, Cebu. She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  Cake Processing and Food Vending. Her husband Camilo L., who is 59 years old, works as a mechanic to earn his living. They have two children who are 24 and 30 years old. Virgenia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 16 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Virgenia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 11,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, improving the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 17th loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000, which she intends to use for additional working capital so that she can continue to save up for future renovation of their house. Virgenia L. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work. Help NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by joining the NWTF Kiva lending team on Kiva.org.

D. is a married woman who lives in Purok 1, Brgy. Bongalonan, Basay, Negros Oriental. She earns her living by operating three businesses: livestock raising, food vending, and fish vending. Her husband Rufino, who is 56 years old, works as a carpenter to earn his living, and also helps with his wife's business activities. They have three children, who are 15 to 30 years old. \r\n<p>\r\nAngelina joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired to something better for her family. With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Angelina has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 9,500, improving the family's standard of living. This time, for her fifth cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 20,000, with which she intends to fund her livestock raising operations, so that she can continue to save up for the education of her children and also buy a new lot to build a house for her family. Angelina D. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About NWTF<\/b><br>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

11 years of membership in ASHI, Teresa D. has developed comradeship with other members of ASHI in their barangays (small districts). The institution helps her to improve not only her living conditions but also the social aspects of her life. This is very useful to her and to her project which is a funeral home.\r\n\r\nEven at 59, her industry never fades. When her husband died, she became the one who managed the business and most of her time is spent on her business and on her children. Moreover, she has done her best to improve her business in order to sustain their basic needs.\r\n\r\nThrough her hardship, courage and industry, her three children have already finished their studies and currently they have stable jobs. \r\n\r\nThough her children have their own jobs, she never stops dreaming about their future. She wants her business to improve so she can help other people in the community by providing employment to them. She has also planned to help their relatives so that they will become successful someday.\r\n\r\nFor her next loan, she is applying for PHP 35,000 which will be utilized as additional capital for her business (funeral home). She wants more capital because there are times when she has customers who can\u2019t afford to buy a coffin in cash. As she is very considerate, she lets her customers pay for the items in installments and that is why she really needs rolling capital.\r\n\r\nShe is now more dignified because there are institutions like ASHI and its field partner KIVA which believe and trust in

She lives in Ibabao, Mactan, Lapu-Lapu City, Cebu. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2008 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her poultry and snacks vending businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 10,000. \r\n\r\nRubielyn is now borrowing PHP 10,000 so that she can purchase more stock to sell. This will be her sixth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 8,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Rubielyn aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means 'Honorable').

She is also engaging in buying and selling vegetables like squash and eggplants. Gina has been engaged in her business for over four years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Gina joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from HSPFI which was used to purchase additional vegetables to buy and sell. Gina is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and provide working capital. This will be the second loan that Gina has taken out from HSPFI.
