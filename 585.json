It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n \r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n \r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

K. is 40 years old. He has 6 years of experience in the beef business. His wife is a housekeeper and Raufjon is the sole breadwinner in his family. Due to this way of life, this father works hard every day to support his family with the best quality of life he can afford. His butcher shop supplies large amounts of meat to the population that resides in their region. Raufjon buys cattle in the market and sells their fresh meat daily to his customers. Due to high demand, this man seeks a loan of 10,000 TJS to invest in more cattle so he can have enough product to meet his customers' demands.     \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She thanks you for your support. \r\n<p>\r\nIn the Kathmandu Valley, a small grocery store called a pasal is an important part of the local economy. Fresh produce, milk, and staples such as rice, lentils, and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home. Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margains. By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability. While a typical pasal might be no more than 100 square feet, they are always full of bargaining customers, incoming produce, and shrewd businesswomen. \r\n<p>\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women.

Working seven days a week and eight hours a day, she is able to support her family.  Gyan Maya has already received and repaid four loans from Patan BPW, and used her most recent one to buy grocery goods for her business.  In the future, she plans to continue to uplift the economic condition of her family. She thanks you for your support. <p>\r\n\r\nIn the Kathmandu Valley, small grocery stores, called pasals, are an important part of the local economy.  Fresh produce, milk, and staples such as rice, lentils, and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home.  Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margains.  By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability.  While a typical pasal might be no more than 100 sq. feet, they are always full of bargaining customers, incoming produce, and shrewd businesswomen. <p>\r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women.

This institution was founded in 1951 by the District Education Council to promote education in the district. The institution is staffed with 12 teachers and has an enrollment of 586 pupils. <p>\r\n\r\nThis is the first loan that DEC Primary School Sinkunia is requesting from Kiva through SMT. With the help of this loan, some of these teachers will start small businesses. Some will invest their loans in an already existing business. Others will buy pieces of furniture and house-building materials, pay school fees for their children, and so on.

This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. \r\n\r\nEdgar is requesting a new loan of 18,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase new items such as rice to expand his product offering. This will be the sixth loan taken out by Edgar from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the loan to improve and expand his business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":754513,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

B. is from the village of Cabisera 9-11, San Antonio, Ilagan, Isabela. She is 40 years old. Celia is married and has two school-aged children. \r\n\r\nCelia raises pigs for fattening and sale to finance the education of their children and the daily needs of her family. Celia has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 4,500 PHP whenever she sells her raised animals.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Celia joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Celia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 20,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. \r\n\r\nCelia is requesting a new loan of 25,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise. This will be the sixth loan taken out by Celia from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the loan to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

She is 43 years old. Evelyn is the group leader of a 6-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Evelyn M.'s Group.\r\n\r\nEvelyn is married and has 2 school-aged children. To make a living, Evelyn owns & operates a general store selling a variety of different products to the local community. Evelyn has been engaged in her business for over 4 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Evelyn joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 18,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. \r\n\r\nEvelyn is requesting a new loan of 20000 PHP to purchase more groceries inventory to sell. This will be her 7th loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay tuition fees for her children. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2400,"image":{"id":746355,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

is 40 years old. She is married and has three children. She lives with her children in Tursunzade, Tajikistan. She sells foodstuffs in her grocery store. Earlier, her husband was engaged in this business and since he left to work in Russia, she has continued this business. She has been in this business for two years. \r\n\r\nThe loan she is requesting is to buy more products for her grocery store so she can get more income. She is a hard-working person who started her business from a small working capital of 500 USD. She would like to get a loan of 1000 USD to purchase new goods to increase her working capital. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He started in this kind of business 15 years ago with working capital in the amount of 5,000 Somoni. Today he is the owner of his business.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, is home to epic mountain passes, and represents a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium B.C. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This group has 10 members who all work in different businesses.  The group is located in one of the districts of Pinotepa Nacional, a place where the people are very kind and have good manners.\r\n\r\nThe group's representative is Eva Isabel S. O..  She is a single mother who has two children in school.  She has a small clothes store where she sells pants, shirts, blouses and t-shirts.  Her small store is located in her home.  She tells us that her sales are doing okay.  She requested this loan so that she could buy more merchandise and thereby better stock her store and make a little more profit for herself and her children since they are her great treasure and she works every day so that they don't want for anything.\r\n\r\nAnother of this group's members is Yesenia L\u00f3pez M. who is married to Eliseo.  She has two children.  One is 8 years old and the other is only one year old.  She requested this loan so that she could buy supplies for making snacks.  She has been in this business for several years.  She has a small sales location in the market where she sells different snacks such as 'sopes' (fried tortillas topped with refried beans and spicy sauce), fried tacos, enchiladas, tostadas and beef tacos.  She says that she started this business from necessity as her husband's money didn't reach far enough.  When her daughter started elementary school she was going to need more money and, for this reason, she started her business.  She tells us that it is doing well and she plans to use the loan that she requested to buy other products so that she can sell other types of snacks since her customers are asking her to make another type of stew and, as the saying goes, 'al cliente lo que pida' (\"give the customer what he wants\").\r\n\r\nYesenia would like to expand her business and she would like her children to study and have a good future.\r\n\r\nThe members of this group are as follows: \r\nJuan Jos\u00e9 - vehicle repair shop\r\nLuis Enrique - footwear sales\r\nEva Isabel - clothes store\r\nYesenia - snack

Throughout the Kathmandu Valley, skilled artisans produce unique pieces of art that reflect Nepal's cultural diversity.  Terracotta pottery comes from the red clay of the surrounding Himalayan foothills.  Bronze and silver statuettes are formed using wax molds and intricate hand tool finishing.  In Patan, Newari culture and traditions are reflected in the images and symbols etched into metal or formed in stone.  With the help of a Kiva loan, Nepal's artisans are able to purchase raw materials in greater volume.

In the future, Maiya plans to uplift the economic condition of her family.  She thanks you for your support.  \r\n\r\nIn the Kathmandu Valley, the small grocery store, called a pasal, is an important part of the local economy.  Fresh produce, milk, and staples such as rice, lentils, and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home.  Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margins.  By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability.  While a typical pasal might be no more than 100 sq. feet, they are always full of bargaining customers, incoming produce, and shrewd businesswomen. \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.  Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering micro-credit and business training programs to low-income women.  In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.

With the help of a Kiva loan, a furniture maker is able to increase the volume of their lumber purchases or hire additional labor.  This additional leverage allows an entrepreneur to increase productivity and profitability. \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women.
