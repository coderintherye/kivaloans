Domincah is a widow. She is a hardworking dairy farmer from Central Kenya in Murang'a town. She has been farming for the last 30 years with only one employee. Her main product is milk, which she sells to Kenya's Brookside company.

She is married to Jackson K. and a mother of three children who are currently in school. Lucy is a farmer and she has been farming her own land for the last twenty years. She learned about KADET from other women who are already registered clients.\r\n\r\nThis will be her second loan of which she is planning to spend fifty thousand shillings to plant more maize which normally does well in her area due to good climatic conditions.

In a month, Topy says she makes profits to the tune of 300,000 shillings and she is anticipating even more once she gets this loan.\r\n\r\nTopy\u2019s future plans are based around the expansion of her business through buying more bags of charcoal and also trying her hand at selling fish.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3625,"image":{"id":535527,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Charcoal Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase more bags of charcoal and fish to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kampala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.315556 32.565556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2010-05-26T15:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Frank","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Deborah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margaret","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Brian","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margaret","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fiona","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Regina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gorrette","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"John","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yowasi","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":7650000,"loan_amount":3625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":637500},{"due_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":637500},{"due_date":"2010-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":637500},{"due_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":637500},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":637500},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":637500},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":637500},{"due_date":"2010-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":637500},{"due_date":"2010-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":637500},{"due_date":"2010-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":637500},{"due_date":"2010-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":637500},{"due_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":637500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":302.08},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":302.09},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":302.08},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":302.08},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":302.09},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":302.08},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":302.08},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":302.09},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":302.08},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":302.08},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":302.09},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":302.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1221.47,"local_amount":2577723,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-20T07:46:41Z","rounded_local_amount":2589129.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152662442,"comment":null},{"amount":740.8,"local_amount":1563351,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:46:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1570269.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159689214,"comment":null},{"amount":492,"local_amount":1038292,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:47:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1042886.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166903382,"comment":null},{"amount":868.65,"local_amount":1833134,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T09:15:43Z","rounded_local_amount":1841245.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172296886,"comment":null},{"amount":302.08,"local_amount":637500,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:36:08Z","rounded_local_amount":640321.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177467218,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-06-01T12:44:12Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T15:36:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":198649,"name":"Miguel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Nuestro socio pertenece al banco comunal \u201cVIRGEN INMACULADA CONCEPCI\u00d3N\u201d;

Several days ago, when Juan de Dios went to Av, Camacho to get his car in order to return home, he realized that the vehicle had been hit in the front wheel assembly, leaving it in terrible condition. Juan de Dios also sells meat.  Since he was very young, his father taught him the business and they traveled to the villages in search of livestock to buy and then sell in the local market.  Today the client\u2019s goal is to open his own butcher shop and so far he has managed to save money to buy equipment and enter into a rental contract.

Due to lack of opportunities, they had to invest their savings in an oven and bread dough to start their business -- the bakery.  \r\n\r\nHer husband is in charge of making the bread dough.

Using the proceeds from her loan, she plans to buy fabric in bulk so that she can make sweatshirts in order to generate more sales during the cold season.  \r\n<p>\r\nSr. Hernan owns a snack business in which he sells roasted chickens with his sister.  This young man is single and supports his mother.  His dream is to become independent and acquire his own location under his name.  The money from his loan will be used to buy supplies for cooking chickens.\r\n<p>\r\nSra. Lilian has a business selling food.  She is divorced, so her business helps to support her three children.  The oldest child is close to becoming a lawyer, while the two younger children are in high school.  Lilian is a determined, cheerful, and enterprising woman who always works for the welfare of her children.\r\n<p>\r\nAll of the members are responsible and dynamic individuals who want to succeed on behalf of their families so that they can improve their quality of life.  They are extremely grateful to Emprender and Kiva for demonstrating their confidence in them by providing this loan.  \t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2000,"image":{"id":535645,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"Purchase fabric in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.5 -68.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Victoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Monica ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hernan Alberto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lilian ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mayra Wendy ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Roel Osmar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wilma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Erika","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":14051.28,"loan_amount":2000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1231.76},{"due_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.84},{"due_date":"2010-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1355.63},{"due_date":"2010-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1377.77},{"due_date":"2010-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1400.28},{"due_date":"2010-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1423.14},{"due_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1446.39},{"due_date":"2010-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1470.02},{"due_date":"2010-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1494.03},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1518.42}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175.32},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":189.86},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.95},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":196.11},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":199.31},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":202.56},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205.87},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":209.24},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":212.65},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":216.13}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":754.24,"local_amount":5299,"processed_date":"2010-06-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:39:15Z","rounded_local_amount":5325.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151880157,"comment":null},{"amount":199.31,"local_amount":1400.28,"processed_date":"2010-06-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:39:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1407.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151880158,"comment":null},{"amount":202.56,"local_amount":1423.14,"processed_date":"2010-07-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:51:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1430.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159620176,"comment":null},{"amount":205.87,"local_amount":1446.39,"processed_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:52:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1453.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159620177,"comment":null},{"amount":209.24,"local_amount":1470.02,"processed_date":"2010-08-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:03:01Z","rounded_local_amount":1477.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166834598,"comment":null},{"amount":212.65,"local_amount":1494.03,"processed_date":"2010-08-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:04:00Z","rounded_local_amount":1501.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166834599,"comment":null},{"amount":216.13,"local_amount":1518.42,"processed_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:57:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1525.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172100988,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-06-23T14:09:49Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T09:57:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":198687,"name":"Ernestina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Nuestra socia pertenece al banco comunal \u201cVIRGEN INMACULADA CONCEPCI\u00d3N\u201d; Nuestra socia vive en el distrito D.

She runs a small store in her home where she sells groceries, clothes, shoes, vegetables, and fruit.  She started her business in a rented home with very few products; now she has her own locale which is much larger and her husband helps her with the business.  Her loan will be used to buy sugar, vegetables, and fruit.  Norma dreams of helping her children to have careers and to someday buy a car to transport her products.  \r\n\r\nThe group members need different loan amounts like $175, $210, and $350 for a total of $5000.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Scott Crandall, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5000,"image":{"id":535659,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase sugar, vegetables and fruit","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2010-05-07T22:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":5000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Norma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Herlinda Lidia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Celia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luiza ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cecilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alicia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Daria Gumercinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anadelia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edwin ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teofilo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Clotilde ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":14200,"loan_amount":5000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2366.66},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2366.66},{"due_date":"2010-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2366.7},{"due_date":"2010-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":2366.66},{"due_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2366.66},{"due_date":"2010-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":2366.66}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":833.35},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":833.33,"local_amount":2366.66,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-17T07:54:05Z","rounded_local_amount":2369.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152158149,"comment":null},{"amount":833.33,"local_amount":2366.66,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:02:15Z","rounded_local_amount":2370,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159629834,"comment":null},{"amount":833.35,"local_amount":2366.7,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:10:20Z","rounded_local_amount":2370.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166843880,"comment":null},{"amount":833.33,"local_amount":2366.66,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:03:29Z","rounded_local_amount":2369.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172110083,"comment":null},{"amount":833.33,"local_amount":2366.66,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-21T11:24:57Z","rounded_local_amount":2370,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177403375,"comment":null},{"amount":833.33,"local_amount":2366.66,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:59:31Z","rounded_local_amount":2369.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182541971,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-06-04T17:41:38Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T13:59:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":198694,"name":"Meiry","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Nuestra socia pertenece al banco comunal \u201cVIRGEN INMACULADA CONCEPCI\u00d3N\u201d; Nuestra socia vive en el distrito de Anta provincia de Anta departamento de Cusco.\n\nNuestra socia es la  Sra.

Someday, she hopes to have her own beauty shop with complete facilities for her customers to enjoy and relax in when they come to her shop.

Even though she received a monthly allowance from her husband, Arlyn still had a passion for business. At present, she has a sari-sari store with an average net income of 1,500 PHP per month, and has two single-seat motorcabs for hire that bring in an average income of 240 PHP daily. These earnings are so helpful in supporting her family. Arlyn joined Kiva partner, PMPC, in 2009. She was given the privilege of borrowing 25,000 PHP as her first loan, which was used to purchase a single motorcab for hire. This time, she is requesting a loan of 12,000 PHP to add to her capital for her sari-sari store. The future income from this loan will be used to make her loan repayments and also as savings for future use.

Her family also enjoys life in its simplest form. \r\n\r\nFrom the time she married, Adita's family has made use of the abundant resources of their surroundings by using fishing, managed by Adita's husband, as their main source of income. Their livelihood from fishing is how Adita has been able to see her eldest child graduate from college and the needs of her four other children, aged 13 to 26, supported.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Adita and her husband decided to expand their fishing activities into a business. Adita joined Kiva's partner, ASHI, to gain access to financial support for their aspirations. Over time, their fishing business has been improving. They were able to purchase a fishing boat, which now has to be repaired after several years of use. \r\n\r\nFor this, Adita is requesting a much larger loan amount. She hopes that by reconditioning the engine and the boat itself, her husband will be able to catch more fish for her to sell directly to people in their village. She also wishes to put aside some savings for renovating their house and hopes to support her eldest child, who works for ASHI as a Development Officer. \r\n\r\nAdita\u2019s eldest child is her inspiration to work hard and support her youngest child's education, as her three other children have not finished their college education due to lack of financial support.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":336,"image":{"id":535790,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","use":"To

H. is an example of a strong woman who can thrive and make a living to help support her family. A 47-year-old mother of five children, she lives in the town of Tanay, Rizal Province, in the Philippines. Marita\u2019s main goal is to build a sustainable business to meet the needs of her children; she was thus encouraged to join ASHI (Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and KIVA partner in the Philippines, in 1999. The previous loans she received from Kiva were carefully invested in her sari-sari (variety) store. Since then, the store has been performing well and earning her sufficient profit. She is grateful that she has been able to educate her children using proceeds from her business as she continues to expand. \r\n\r\nMarita needs a loan to help boost her business for increased profit making. Now requesting her sixth loan, she is requesting for 25,000 PHP as additional capital for her sari-sari (variety) store, to be used to pay for groceries for her venture. Marita is optimistic that she can achieve her dreams of providing a good life for her children and of being able to send them to school until they finish college. She also hopes to expand her business and, if possible, she would like to have a branch in the town proper, in order to provide employment to others. She hopes that these dreams will come true and that ASHI will in fact give the best direction and opportunity for her family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":535807,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Cheryl has been engaged in her business for over 4 years and earns approximately 4,500 PHP a week for these activities. In 2005, Cheryl aimed to join ASHI to secure access to financial services to help improve her living condition and to have the ability to engage in more business activities. Cheryl has successfully repaid a previous loan from ASHI. This previous loan was used to purchase inventory for her business. Cheryl is requesting a new loan of 25,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory of vegetables & frozen foods products. This will be the 6th loan taken out by Cheryl from ASHI. She plans to use the additional proceeds generated from the business to develop her business. She hopes that, with the help of KIVA field partner, she can reach her ambition to step out from under umbrella of poverty, develop her business, and provide for the needs of her children in school.\r\n\r\nHer long term goals are to purchase a new jeepney and tricycle so that she can expand her vegetables & frozen foods vending business to other surrounding neighborhoods. By owning her own transportation, Cheryl will save time and money in purchasing a greater variety of inventory as well as selling products in additional territories. She also dreams to have her own stall in the public market where she can sell her products. With her hard work, focus, and determination, Cheryl is hopeful that her business ventures will continue to grow and improve the overall standard of living for her entire

Ardeliza has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase fishing equipment including hooks & nets. Ardeliza is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be the 2nd loan taken out by Ardeliza from PMPC.

She is 37 years old. Anelyn is the group leader of a three member group loan offered by PMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nAnelyn is married and has one infant child. To make a living, Anelyn owns a business in which she raises livestock. The main source of income for the business comes from raising pigs for sale. Anelyn has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Anelyn joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Anelyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 15,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future. Anelyn is requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This loan will be the 4th loan taken out by Anelyn from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Adelina is the group leader of a 2-member group loan offered by PMPC. While each of the group receives an individual loan, they are each responsible for paying back the loan of their fellow group member if she is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is 'Adelina V.\u2019s Group'. \n\t\nAdelina is married to Alejandro V., her business partner. They are blessed with 4 children;and now they are all in adult-aged. The couple decided to engage in business by operating a charcoal retail.  For 20 years already, the couple has been able to manage these businesses and now they are earning an average net income of not less than P 6,000 a month, which is very helpful as their family income.\n\nMrs. V. joined the cooperative in the year 2009. As an active member of the PDP-LP (Paglaum Development Program for Landless People) of PAGLAUM MPC, a micro-finance program that reaches out to the rural poor, she is requesting the amount of P 7,000 as her 2nd loan for the purpose of purchasing additional charcoal to sell. The future income from this loan will be used to improve the living conditions for her family, to meet their basic needs, as savings for future use, and for children\u2019s education. She is hoping that someday her business will become more progressive.\n\nAbout PMPC: \n\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model. \n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

The official name of this borrowing group is 'Susan C.\u2019s Group'. \t\n\nSusan is married to Edgar C., a driver with an average net income of P 300 a day. They are blessed with 7 children; one is already married and the rest are still single and in their teenage years. To help her husband in supporting their family, Susan decided to engage in business, particularly in recycling activities.  For 20 years already, she has been able to manage this little business and now she is earning an average net income of not less than P 4,000 a month which is very helpful for their family income.\n\nSusan joined the cooperative just this year. As a new member of the PDP-LP (Paglaum Development Program for Landless People) of PAGLAUM MPC, a micro-finance program that reaches out to the rural poor, she is requesting the amount of P 5,000 as her 1st loan for the purpose of adding to her capital for her existing recycling activity. The future income from this loan will be used to improve the living conditions for her family, to meet their basic needs, as savings for future use, and for their children\u2019s education. \n\nSusan is hoping that someday her business will become more progressive.\n\nAbout PMPC: \n\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC)is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she has been able to borrow quite a few times through CCT\u2019s Cooperative.  She is consistent in paying her dues because she uses the money she borrows to expand and improve her variety store.     \r\n\r\nTo ensure the success of her business, she would like to apply for a PHP 20,000 loan.

While each of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Elena S. J.\u2019s Group.\n\nElena is married to Danilo S. J., a forklift operator with an average net income of P3,600 every 15th and 30th day of the month. They are blessed with six children who are all now in their teens.\n\nTo help her husband in supporting their family, Elena decided to engage in a snack-vending business, particularly banana cue (deep-fried banana covered with caramelized brown sugar), and a sari-sari store. For fifteen years already, she has been able to manage this little business and now she is earning an average net income of not less than P1,500 a month which, she said, is so helpful to their family income.\n\nElena joined Paglaum MPC just this year. As a newly recognized member of the PDP-LP (Paglaum Development Program for Landless People) Program of Paglaum MPC, a micro-finance program that reaches out to the rural poor, she is requesting P3,000 as her first loan to add to the capital of her existing business activity which is her sari-sari store and snack-vending business.\n\nThe future income from this loan will be used to improve the living conditions of Elena\u2019s family, to meet their basic needs, and as savings for future use and for house repair. She is hoping that someday her business will become more progressive and that all her children will finish their studies up to college level.\n\n\nAbout PMPC:\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

Agrepina has been engaged in her business for over 21 years and earns approximately 2,300 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Agrepina joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Agrepina has successfully repaid a previous loan of 2,500 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used as additional capital for her business. Agrepina is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional stocks of rice. This loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by Agrepina from PMPC.\r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

He is married and the father of four children.  He resides with his wife and their children in a large traditional extended family in the Bougoula Ville district, in downtown Sikasso (3rd administrative region of the Republic of Mali).  He was introduced to this wood-working trade of his by his father, who used to be a master builder and well-known by the people of Sikasso.  \r\n\r\nWith a great deal of experience in this domain, he receives many orders.  But since he can't afford to satisfy all of the ever-growing demand, he decided to join the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso over two year ago and is now on his third individual loan.  He is requesting this third loan for increasing his working capital in order to reinvigorate his business and to respond to customer expectations, which are ever-growing.  \r\n\r\nThus, with this third loan, Diakalia plans on buying 1\u00bd truck loads (ten-tonne size) of rafters and boards and a half load of plywood sheets.  He purchases his lumber in the surrounding towns (Tinkrela, Denderso, Lobougoula, etc.), cuts them up, and takes them to Sikasso to make furniture:  benches, bench-tables, desks, and chairs in order to sell them.  \r\n\r\nDiakalia envisions using this loan to make a monthly profit of 275,000 francs CFA that will be used essentially to help with family expenses, to pay the loan interest, and to reinvest the rest in his business. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":535968,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture Making","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"Buying lumber ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-05-06T22:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Diakalia ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2010-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2011-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2011-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":125000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":250,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:35Z","rounded_local_amount":126564.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159699640,"comment":null},{"amount":250,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:13Z","rounded_local_amount":126564.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177476660,"comment":null},{"amount":250,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2011-01-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-17T00:57:14Z","rounded_local_amount":126564.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191606110,"comment":null},{"amount":250,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2011-03-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T12:12:58Z","rounded_local_amount":126564.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201361323,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-05-07T15:47:52Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T12:12:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":198876,"name":"Kaitet Ole","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kaitet Ole N. is 47 years old, married to Kinyeketa N., and the father of three children. \r\n\r\nKaitet is a farmer and  has been farming his land for the last seven years.\r\n  \r\nHe learnt about KADET from a member of a group within his locality that is registered with KADET.

After having worked in many businesses without success, she was introduced two years ago to making traditional soaps (black soap), which she learned how to make from a friend.  Working out of her home, she is much in demand for the quality of her products.  \r\n\r\nTo satisfy her burgeoning customer base, Ma\u00efssata decided to join the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso over a year ago.  With the goal of reinvigorating business further, in order to respond to customer expectations, she is therefore requesting a second loan.  She plans on using this second loan to buy five barrels of waste cotton oil (black paste), two drums of cotton oil, five sacks of caustic soda, a packet of perfume, and four cart loads of firewood.  She purchases her ingredients locally and in Bobo Dioulasso (Republic of Burkina Faso).  After making the soaps, she sells them retail to a customer base composed generally of women.  \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Ma\u00efssata envisions making a monthly profit of 150,000 francs CFA that will be used essentially to increase her working capital and to help cover family expenses.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":535973,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":"Buying raw materials for making soap ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-05-06T22:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ma\u00efssata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":200000,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":22222.22},{"due_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":22222.22},{"due_date":"2010-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":22222.22},{"due_date":"2010-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":22222.22},{"due_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":22222.22},{"due_date":"2010-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":22222.22},{"due_date":"2010-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":22222.22},{"due_date":"2011-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":22222.22},{"due_date":"2011-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":22222.24}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.45},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.45},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.45},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.45},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":44.44,"local_amount":22222.22,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:16:45Z","rounded_local_amount":22500.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151961520,"comment":null},{"amount":44.45,"local_amount":22222.22,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:39Z","rounded_local_amount":22500.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159699641,"comment":null},{"amount":44.44,"local_amount":22222.22,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:58:11Z","rounded_local_amount":22500.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166913527,"comment":null},{"amount":44.45,"local_amount":22222.22,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:41:16Z","rounded_local_amount":22500.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172180692,"comment":null},{"amount":44.44,"local_amount":22222.22,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:22Z","rounded_local_amount":22500.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177476661,"comment":null},{"amount":44.45,"local_amount":22222.22,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:40:25Z","rounded_local_amount":22500.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182613396,"comment":null},{"amount":44.44,"local_amount":22222.22,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:43:21Z","rounded_local_amount":22500.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188751870,"comment":null},{"amount":44.45,"local_amount":22222.22,"processed_date":"2011-01-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-17T00:57:13Z","rounded_local_amount":22500.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191606111,"comment":null},{"amount":44.44,"local_amount":22222.24,"processed_date":"2011-02-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:20:13Z","rounded_local_amount":22500.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195917758,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-05-07T03:20:06Z","paid_date":"2011-03-15T12:20:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":198880,"name":"Harison","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Harison is a 23-year-old, single man. \r\n\r\nHarison is a farmer.

After five solidarity loans with a women's association in her district (Association DANAYA de Wayerma I), she is now on her first individual loan.  All the preceding ones have been properly repaid.  \r\n\r\n\r\nShe plans on using this loan to buy 20 pairs of various shoes, 8 bolts of Wax <i>pagnes<\/i> (colorful West African cloth), 5 outfits of embroidered fabrics, and 5 boxes of tomato paste.  Her goods are sold retail, cash or credit accepted, by going door-to-door.  Her customer base is composed essentially of women.  \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Mariam envisions making a monthly profit of 120,000 francs CFA that will be used essentially to increase her working capital, to help cover family expenses, and to pay the loan interest.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":535980,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Buying various goods ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-05-06T23:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariam ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":300000,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2010-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2010-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2011-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":60000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":120,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:16:51Z","rounded_local_amount":60751,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151961521,"comment":null},{"amount":120,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:58:15Z","rounded_local_amount":60750.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166913528,"comment":null},{"amount":120,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:30Z","rounded_local_amount":60751,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177476662,"comment":null},{"amount":120,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:42:44Z","rounded_local_amount":60750.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188751871,"comment":null},{"amount":120,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2011-02-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:20:13Z","rounded_local_amount":60751,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195917759,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-05-09T23:36:39Z","paid_date":"2011-03-15T12:20:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":198886,"name":"Mercy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mercy is 35 years old, married with a child.

The profits will be used to repay the loan, help their husbands, and bolster their businesses by diversifying the products they sell.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Patrick Stadelmann, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":536008,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy and resell various food products and clothing ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"San S\u00e9gou","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-05-07T14:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Assa Morike ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bintou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Baro ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maimouna ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dero ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bakoro ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":525000,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":87500},{"due_date":"2010-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":87500},{"due_date":"2010-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":87500},{"due_date":"2010-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":87500},{"due_date":"2010-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":87500},{"due_date":"2010-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":87500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":175,"local_amount":87500,"processed_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:33Z","rounded_local_amount":88595.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144779307,"comment":null},{"amount":175,"local_amount":87500,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:16:49Z","rounded_local_amount":88595.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151961526,"comment":null},{"amount":175,"local_amount":87500,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:30Z","rounded_local_amount":88595.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159699645,"comment":null},{"amount":175,"local_amount":87500,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:58:09Z","rounded_local_amount":88595.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166913533,"comment":null},{"amount":175,"local_amount":87500,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:41:05Z","rounded_local_amount":88595.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172180696,"comment":null},{"amount":175,"local_amount":87500,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:18Z","rounded_local_amount":88595.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177476667,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-05-09T14:39:03Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":198910,"name":"Aean","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Aean C. is 53 years old and lives in the village of Tuol Svay in Takeo province.

B., 30, is making sure that her family has enough for their daily needs. Married to Napoleon B., a factory worker, she is blessed with one child in their marriage. She makes sure that she helps her husband earn so that their family can have a better life.  She has been managing her own variety store while selling electronic cellular phone load for quite some time now.\r\n\r\nDaisy has been a regular member of Center for Community Transformation* (CCT) for more than a year now. She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she was able to borrow six times through CCT\u2019s Cooperative.  She is consistent in paying her dues because she uses the money she borrows to expand and improve her variety store.     \r\n\r\nTo ensure the success of her business, she would like to apply for a PHP 12,000 loan. This amount will be used as a source of added capital to her expanding business, buying groceries, toiletries and beverages necessary to replenish stocks in her store.

B., 33, is making sure that her family has enough for their daily needs. Married to Daniel B., a businessman, she is blessed with one child in their marriage. She makes sure that she helps her husband earn so that their family can have a better life.  She has been managing her own fruit stand while operating a hardware store selling mainly carpentry tools. She also raises a few hogs for additional income.\r\n\r\nLeliosa has been a regular member of Center for Community Transformation* (CCT) for more than a year now. She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she was able to borrow quite a few times through CCT\u2019s Cooperative.  She is consistent in paying her dues because she uses the money she borrows to expand and improve her businesses.     \r\n\r\nTo ensure the success of her business, she would like to apply for a PHP 23,000 loan. This amount will be used as a source of added capital to her expanding business, buying more products to be sold at her hardware store to replenish her current product stock.\r\n\r\nShe dreams that her business will continue to grow so that she can provide for her children\u2019s education.\r\n\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":536076,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

Currently, the school is staffed with four teachers on its payroll and three SLIM-assisted teachers. The school has a population of 116 pupils.  \r\n\r\nThis group of teachers has come to SMT, a partner of \"Shine on Sierra Leone\" in Waterloo, to seek a loan in order to supplement their monthly salaries.  With the help of these loans, they can accomplish certain tasks that they would otherwise not have been able to accomplish with their mere salaries alone. At the end of each month, these teachers can repay the loan out of their monthly salaries. The institution\u2019s bursar is directly responsible for deducting the repayment and pays SMT on their behalf.\r\n\r\nFrancis V. B.

Guti\u00e9rrez is 43 years old  she lives with her parents and her 13 year old son. She is a woman who does not stand still as regards looking for new income and becoming qualified, therefore she has done courses in marketing and sales, hairdressing and beauty, food preparation and footwear manufacturing and she has got a return from all of them. Then she earned income selling shoes, clothing and accessories that stregthen the image of women, men and children. She does hairdressing at home, she makes \"hayacas\" (meat wrapped in cornmeal dough and banana leaves), \"deditos\" (finger shaped pastries) and \"frituras\" (fried food)  in the weekends helped by her mother. She makes shoes when her customers take her the model they ask her for and she also works part time in a company provisionally in various roles, where she has managed to acquire her cusomers who are mainly company employees, although she also has housewives, neighbours, friends and family. Recently, her sister who is a customer of the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, as things have gone well with this organization, advised her to access the loan programme so that she can keep expanding her market, therefore she is asking for financing to the value of $ 1,500,000 to buy women's clothing and footwear for men and women.   \r\nMarlyn lives in the suburb of Jos\u00e9 Antonio Gal\u00e1n, in the Suroriente de Barranquilla locality. It is characterized by the great joy of its people and the spirit of solidarity that they demonstrated when they succeeded in supporting local government for the paving of their streets, through resources obtained from walks, bingo, raffles, festivals and other community activities. It is in this environment where Merlyn has developed her business, which started when working in a company. She used to help her cousin to win customers in order to sell them his goods, and there she saw the possibility of an additional income and started the same business selling to friends, neighbors and grew her customer base offering goods to all that came near; her cousin continued to supply her until she saved the $150,000 that allowed her to negotiate directly with department stores and local stores, as up until now she did it through a healthy business connection. Now her great challenge is to complete a sustainable business expansion and in the future her dream is to have a local store where she can integrate all her businesses and her main goal is to offer Yosimar,  her son, the highest quality education and always be his emotional support.       \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Catherine Dent, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":523097,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy women's clothing and footwear for men and women.

'Kenkey' is a maize-based dough ball that is usually eaten with pepper sauce and fish.  Abena will use the loan to buy more maize to prepare 'kenkey'.  She hopes to expand her business by supplying 'kenkey' to stores in towns such as Kumawu and Abofanso.  \r\n\r\nAbena is currently the leader of the group named \"Mmodenmmo\", which means \u201chard-working\u201d in Twi, the language most commonly spoken in Ghana.  There are 10 members in this group.   The other members in the group also operate retail businesses selling items such as fresh tomatoes, yams, onions, 'kenkey', rice and stew.  The members in the group live in the same area and trust each other.

The coordinator is se\u00f1or Marvin Alberto S. M\u00e9ndez, who has a stretch in the Mercado de Masaya market, where he sells eggs by the carton.  He started this business because he worked at a poultry business where he loaded and unloaded containers, and the company proposed that he get a stretch in the market since they were going to offer him the eggs to sell on credit.  He currently sells large quantities of eggs and needs a larger quantity of products.

Her husband died years ago leaving her a widow with their children.  She lives alone because her children are now married.  But, her grandchildren visit her everyday.  (She appears in the photo with her ten year old grandson.)\r\n\r\nHer husband was the one who worked.  But, when he died she was left without any income.  She used the savings she had to buy chickens to sell to her neighbors and friends.  Little by little she started to get income.  She bought a freezer because the chickens no longer fit in the refrigerator.\r\n\r\nShe continues in the business as it is the first income she has had since her husband died.  She works everyday selling chickens, turkey, and meats.  She wants to use the loan to buy more chickens, meats, and turkeys for her business.  In the future she wants to have a poultry farm to be able to have a secure old age.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva
