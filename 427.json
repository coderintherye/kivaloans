vio a su madre enfrentar con responsabilidad este reto de educarlas como personas de bien.  Ella desde que estaba en el bachillerato practic\u00f3 el h\u00e1bito del ahorro, pues con el poco dinero que su mama le daba para la merienda, lograba  juntarlo  para comprar productos que luego vend\u00eda  entre sus compa\u00f1eras de clase y obten\u00eda su utilidad, pr\u00e1ctica que hoy tambi\u00e9n realiza  y que le permiti\u00f3 iniciar y sostener  el  negocio de vender mercanc\u00eda variada;  ella comenta que  con lo que le da su esposo para cubrir los gastos del hogar  ella ahorra y esta es justamente la base de su capital de trabajo que ha fortalecido la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo , mediante cr\u00e9ditos y ya tiene alrededor de 7 a\u00f1os de estar vinculada  a esta organizaci\u00f3n. El negocio de Mary Luz consiste en conseguirle a sus clientes las mercanc\u00edas que ellos necesiten en la l\u00ednea de jabones, cremas dentales, papel higi\u00e9nico, adornos, accesorios, papeler\u00eda  que exhibe en una peque\u00f1a vitrina y  que vende de contado y  de otras mercanc\u00edas como cosm\u00e9ticos, ropa que suele  d\u00e1rsela a sus clientes para que le paguen a plazos de acuerdo al plan concertado. Mary Luz prefiere clientes que trabajen en empresas, para no tener dificultades con la recuperaci\u00f3n de su dinero, porque dice  que \u201csi una persona no trabaja no tiene de donde sacar para pagarle\u201d. Desde que inici\u00f3 en la Fundaci\u00f3n su capital de trabajo se ha incrementado y el beneficio de la utilidad de su negocio se refleja en que ha mejorado su vivienda, que  antes estaba en proceso de construcci\u00f3n y ahora ya luce muy adecuada, de igual manera ha comprado un computador para que sus ni\u00f1os estudien y est\u00e1 validando el bachillerato, mientras su esposo trabaja en un restaurante, para sacar entre los dos adelante a su familia. Mary Luz cuenta que tiene una hermana que la acompa\u00f1a en todos las innovaciones que le  hace a su negocio, pues ella tiene una capacidad creativa maravillosa para envolver regalos, hacer arreglos acordes a cada situaci\u00f3n  y la ha ayudado, como cuando Mary Luz se invent\u00f3 vender a los ni\u00f1os peque\u00f1as sorpresas que incluyeron premios y les dej\u00f2 este negocio una  muy buena utilidad.  En la actualidad Mary solicita un cr\u00e9dito a la Fundaci\u00f3n para comprar mercanc\u00eda variada y prepararse para venderla el d\u00eda del amor y de la amistad, porque quiere en su negocio exhibir peque\u00f1os detalles bien empacados, que llamen la atenci\u00f3n : Cosm\u00e9ticos, cuadernillos, cintas, papel de regalo, adornos, ganchos y accesorios.\nEl sue\u00f1o de Mary es hacer de su negocio un gran almac\u00e9n, donde pueda atender m\u00e1s efectivamente a sus hijos de 3, 8, 10 y 11 a\u00f1os de edad,  desde su hogar y no salir tanto donde sus clientes;  y este es justamente su gran desaf\u00edo, porque tiene muchos afanes generados por la forma de desarrollar su negocio, pero quiere seguir siendo independiente y construir junto a  su esposo una familia exitosa de la mano de Dios.\n\n","en":"Marly Luz O. is a very responsible person.  This is because her father died when she was still a girl; she and her sisters saw how her mother responsibly faced the goal of teaching them to be good people.\r\n\r\nEver since she was in high school she has practiced the habit of saving.  She got together the little bit of money her mother gave her for a snack and bought products that she later sold to her classmates.  She got a profit, and she continues to do so now.  This allowed her to start and sustain her business of selling varied merchandise.\r\n\r\nShe comments that she saves from what her husband gives her to cover the household expenses.  This is indeed the base of her working capital, which the Funcaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo has strengthened through loans.  She has been involved with this organization for around seven years.\r\n\r\nMary Luz\u2019s business consists of getting her customers the merchandise they need like soap, toothpaste, toilet paper, decorations, accessories, and stationery that she displays in a small showcase.  She sells these products for cash.  The other merchandise like cosmetics and clothes she usually gives to her customers, and they make payments according to the agreed upon plan.\r\n\r\nMary Luz prefers customers who work in companies so that she does not have difficulties recovering her money.  She says, \u201cIf a person does not work, they do not have the means to pay her\u201d.  Since she started in the Fundaci\u00f3n her working capital has increased, and the beneficial profit from her business is reflected in the improvements made to her house.  \r\n\r\nThe house was previously under construction, and now it looks good.  In the same fashion she has bought a computer for her children to use in their education, and she is pursuing a high school degree.  Her husband works in a restaurant so that between the two of them they can get their family ahead.\r\n\r\nMary Luz says that she has a sister who joins her in all of the innovations she makes to her business.  She has a marvelous creative capacity to wrap presents and make arrangements for each situation.  She helps her.  For instance, when Mary Luz came up with the idea of selling surprises that included prizes for small children, it made this business very profitable.\r\n\r\nMary is currently requesting a loan from the Fundaci\u00f3n to buy varied merchandise to sell for Valentine\u2019s Day.  She wants her business to display small items with good packaging, which will call attention to them.  She will buy things like cosmetics, small notebooks, ribbons, wrapping paper, decorations, clips, and accessories.  \r\n\r\nMary\u2019s dream is to make her business a great store.  Then she would be able to take care of her children more effectively at home and not have to leave so much to see her customers.  Her children are 3, 8, 10, and 11 years old.  That is precisely her great challenge.  She is very eager to develop her business.  However, she wants to continue being independent.  Together with her husband she also wants to build a successful family in Gods\u2019 hands.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

Since she is the sole breadwinner in her family, she strives to educate her three children because she believes education is the key to a better future.<p>\r\n\r\nShe joined the New Mwala group, whose members guarantee each others' loans from Faulu Kenya. She has previously borrowed two loans from Faulu Kenya, which she timely repaid and used to improve her business.  For this reason, she is now seeking another loan, this time in the amount of 40,000 KES ($500).  This loan would be used to add to her stock of beans, maize, and peas.

She owns and operates a retail shop, where she sells sugar, bread, sweets, maize, flour, and wheat flour.  She has ten years of experience in this line of business.  <p>\r\n\r\nAs a prudent businesswoman, she has been saving her money with Machakos Mwangaza group members in Faulu Kenya.  The group members also guarantee each others' loan.  She previously took out a loan in the amount of 30,000 KES through the group.  She used that loan, which she promptly repaid, to improve and expand her business.  By doing so, her group members now have faith in her.  Hence, she has been allowed to seek another loan, this time in the amount of 50,000 KES ($625).  With the loan proceeds, she would like to buy sugar, maize, flour, and sweets for re-sale purposes.  Lillian hopes to expand her business to generate more income so that she can pay school fees for her child.  She is ambitious and dreams of expanding her shop into a wholesale

H.  has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,152,000 VND from SEDA, which was used to purchase raw materials to manufacture additional products. H.  is now requesting a new loan of 8,288,000 VND which will be used to purchase additional raw materials to expand product offerings. This will be the 2nd loan taken out by Hanh from SEDA.

To making a living, T. owns & operates a business making & selling snacks & other delicacies in the local community. T. has been engaged in this business for over a years and earns approximately 3,000,000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, T. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. T. has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,152,000 VND from SEDA. This previous loan was used to invest in expanding the business. T. is now requesting a new loan of 8,288,000 VND which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the 2nd loan taken out by T. from SEDA. T. plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout SEDA:\r\n\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to the low income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the Northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n\r\nT.

T. plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\nAbout SEDA:\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to the low income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the Northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n\r\nT.

Despite the challenge she faced with her previous business of rice retailing, wherein some of her capital was used to sustain her husband\u2019s transportation business, still she feels she made the right decision. It was through the income earned by her husband that she has been able to pay back the amount loaned to her.\r\n\r\nWith what had happen to her business previously, Vivian realized that earnings are greater in the transportation business than in rice retailing. In their community a lot of people are into rice retailing and therefore demand for the rice is low. Now that she has another opportunity to request a loan, Vivian wants to spend it on improving and maintaining her husband\u2019s tricycle (motorcycle with sidecar). She plans to purchase tricycle spare parts and pay for reconditioning.\r\n\r\nVivian also wants to venture into another two business which are selling frozen foods (processed foods) and hog raising. After four months of raising her hogs, they will be sold per kilo, either alive or slaughtered, direct to people in their village.\r\n\r\nVivian thinks that the frozen foods will be salable because everyone in the community is looking for a convenient way of preparing food for their children before they go to school, just like she did for her children when they were still small. Just like other small children in their village, her apos (grandchildren) are always fond of eating processed food such as marinated pork and chicken and that is why she is inspired to include these in the items she will sell.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":289.25,"image":{"id":567170,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle

Phea N. is 39 years old and is a villager in Ta Non village, Takeo province. She and her husband, Mr. Von Ngon, are silk weavers at home and aside from silk weaving, Mrs. Phea N. is also a grocery seller who owns a small store to support her business.

Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb (20211020026) is a 34 year-old woman living in the town of huy\u1ec7n Y\u00ean Phong - t\u1ec9nh B\u1eafc Ninh.  She is married and has 2 school-aged children.  To making a living, P. owns & operates a business venture in the food sector making & selling food.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling rice products in the local community.  P. has been engaged in this business for over 8 years and earns approximately 4.500.000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2009, P. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  P. has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4.256.000 VND from SEDA.  This previous loan was used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale.  P. is now requesting a new loan of 8.288.000 VND which will be used to invest in expanding the business.  The loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by the borrower from SEDA.  P. plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout SEDA:\r\n\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to the low income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the Northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":567197,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

M\u1eabn Th\u1ecb (20201060046) is a 27-year-old female living in the town of huy\u1ec7n Y\u00ean Phong - t\u1ec9nh B\u1eafc Ninh. She is married and has 2 school-aged children.  To making a living, P. owns & operates a furniture-making business.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from making & selling general household furniture to local businesses and community members.  P. has been engaged in this business for over 4 years and earns approximately 4.000.000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2008, P. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  P. has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5.600.000 VND from SEDA.  This previous loan was used to purchase additional raw materials to expand product offerings.  P. is now requesting a new loan of 8.288.000 VND which will be used to purchase additional inventory and for working capital. The loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by the borrower from SEDA.  P. plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve the general living conditions of the her family.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout SEDA:\r\n\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to the low income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the Northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n\r\nP.

Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb (20201060042) is a 38-year-old female living in the town of huy\u1ec7n Y\u00ean Phong - t\u1ec9nh B\u1eafc Ninh. She is married and has 2 school-aged children.  B. owns and operates a butcher shop. The main source of income for the business comes from butchering and selling pork in the local community. B. has been engaged in this business for over 8 years and earns approximately 3.600.000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2008, B. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  B. has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5.600.000 VND from SEDA. This previous loan was used to expand her business. B. is now requesting a new loan of 8.288.000 VND which will be used to renovate her business. The loan will be the 3rd loan she has taken from SEDA. B. plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve the general living conditions of the her family.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout SEDA:\r\n\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to the low income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the Northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n\r\nB.

H. is the group leader of a 3-member group loan offered by SEDA. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.  The official name of this borrowing group is \u0110\u1ed3ng Th\u00f4n 2 nh\u00f3m 06 (Nh\u00f3m 06).\r\n\r\nH. owns a general store selling school supplies such pencils, pen and notebooks. She has been engaged in this business for over 5 years and earns approximately 4.000.000 VND a month.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2009, H. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5.152.000 VND from SEDA which was used to purchase additional products to sell. She is now requesting a new loan of 7.840.000 VND which will be used to invest in expanding the business. The loan will be the second loan she has taken from SEDA.

Jean, 45 years old, has had her retail shop in Ntungamo Town for 12 years. She started this business out of savings from her salary as a clerk. It goes without saying that hard work and determination have brought her this far. She has also been getting additional profits from her catering business. She is fully able to live within the ways and means of her business. To reach this milestone, she has gone through the many challenges that plague all businesses. In her case, being a widow, she has had to grapple with the operational costs of her business alone. Her strong resolve has seen her through all this.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<p>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The business went well after it started. \r\n\r\nOver time Dilbar expanded her business and now her grocery store is well known in her community.  In order to expand her business she requests a loan of $1500 US Dollars. Dilbar is planning to use the loan to purchase more goods to resell, thus increasing the range of foodstuffs she sells. She thanks everyone who decides to support her.  \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She does not have any employees. She has an income of around 6,000 meticais per month, which is used for household expenses.

This loan, in the amount of 20,000 meticais, is her fourth with Hluvuku and first with Kiva. She intends to buy tea leaves, cooking oil, sugar, flour and other products to increase her inventory. Her previous loans were for 15,500, 25,000 and 31,000 and were used to raise chicks. \r\n\r\nShe is confident she will have no problems paying the loan back.

The hard work that Antonio puts in on his land has brought him good production. His crops of potatoes, peas, and oca, a South American tuber, have been ample and of good quality. So Antonio get to enjoy the fruits of his hard labor in the field. However, to have an excellent harvest one must always be vigilant and make sure that pests do not affect the plants' growth. With time Antonio hopes to buy more land to increase his production.

Four years ago she started working making roof tiles and bricks (for roofs) from the land that she and her husband rent. The materials used in this process are the clay from the land along with materials that they buy like sand and sawdust. The work hours are long often lasting the entire day. She likes to work extra hours to increase production and she says that the most profitable times for this business is the summer. Sales are slower during the winter because it is more difficult to gather the necessary materials for production and because the bricks will not dry due to frequent rains. She has plans to expand her factory to increase production and thus improve their situation in life.

Humberto is a very hard working man who is such a business expert that he has been able, through his business activities, to acquire 2 houses.  At his 74 years, he has 14 children between the ages of 18 and 44.  \r\nHumberto makes his living renting washing machines.  His business is a product of his long-time enterprising capacity that began in the year 1972 when he starting selling merchandise in Maicao, a town in the Department of Guajira, in the north of Colombia.  At that time, he had a shop in a mall.  He closed it when it was affected by the devaluation of the Bol\u00edvar, the currency of his country, which borders Venezuela.  Because he lost a good part of his capital with that initial business, he persisted in opening a restaurant in the location where he had sold merchandise.  It lasted 3 years.  But since he didn't fulfill his expectations, he moved to Barranquilla and started his washing machine rental service.  \r\nIn the beginning, he had only 2 washing machines to offer as rentals in the community, but he expanded to serve more than 5 nearby neighborhoods.  Humberto tends to bring his machines to whomever requests his service by himself in a hand truck.   He transfers them very carefully, which is why they are still in good condition.  Likewise, because he is very organized and responsible with his customers, his business constantly flows.  He has 16 regular customers.  Offering this service is his only source of income.  He says that his business has been a great blessing for him since it allows him to clear all his expenses and to live comfortably in his improved his dwellings.  He is a hardworking and honest man.  He enjoys great success with his customers from the different neighborhoods where he offers his services.  \r\nHe was punctual with the re-payment of his previous loan.  He is currently requesting a second loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo in the amount of $1.500.000 COP ($800 USD).  With this financing he is going to purchase 4 more washing machines.  The ones he has are insufficient to meet the demand, especially on the weekends when housewives have their day off and spend their time taking care of this chore, which is left undone from their work days.  \r\nThrough his first loan, he was able to add more machines and gradually increase his earnings.  His goal is to have additional capital available to him so that he can start selling merchandise again.  This is an activity in which he has experience, and he would use the housewives he currently rents to as his main niche market for this new business.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Marni

She makes her living through her business.\r\n\r\nThis is her first loan through the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation.  She plans to invest the funds into the purchase of a cover for her hot dog vending cart.  She will invest the rest into buying basic ingredients in bulk, such as rice, cooking oil, and flour.\r\n\r\nWhen she was 13 years old, Diana Mar\u00eda started working as a domestic, an activity she carried out until she turned 40.  At that point, she decided to make a childhood dream a reality:  to have her own business.  This is how she got started selling fried foods such as patacones (fried plantains) from the front porch of her home.  She later expanded her business by adding papas rellenas (stuffed potatoes) of beef, chicken or mixed, cakes, and lunches.  This activity that has gone a long way in sustaining the family, especially the two youngest children that she still supports.  She has triumphed through her own effort and work ethic, given the lack of support from their father.\r\n\r\nHer biggest dreams are to own a house and to expand her business with a greater variety of fast foods.  Currently, her greatest challenges are to see her older children become independent and to outfit her enterprise to meet the neighborhood\u2019s demands.  So, when she had to replace her wood stove with a gas one, she was able to work and serve her neighbors more comfortably.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva

He lives in his own house with his 43 year old wife, Reyda, and their two minor children.  They are the motivation for all of his efforts.\r\n\r\nJuan grows potatoes and peas.  He does this work together with his wife, who also works arduously to give their children a good education.  He has seen that it is beneficial to take his products to the city of Tarma.  According to Juan, that is where he gets the best earnings.\r\n\r\nHe has been doing this activity for 20 years.  That is why he always tries to take care of his crops so the pests do not get to them.  The pests can hamper the development of his crops.  In time he hopes to improve what he sows.  With their sale he will be able to increase his income.\r\n\r\nThis is his seventh loan with MFP.  He feels obliged to make all of his payments on time.  He does not want to cause problems for the members of his communal bank where he is held in high regard.  He will use the 1,500 soles he is requesting to buy more fertilizer for his crops.   \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":567479,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Buy more fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-07-14T15:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":550,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:03:43Z","rounded_local_amount":1553.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188724900,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-07-15T01:18:55Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T14:03:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":214224,"name":"Rachidatou","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"T. rachidatou est mari\u00e9e et m\u00e8re d'un enfant, elle vit avec sa famille dans le quartier de totsi qui est un quartier p\u00e9riph\u00e9rique de la ville de Lom\u00e9. elle exerce comme activit\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9ratrice de revenu le commerce de produits d'alimentation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. en ce moment elle fait face \u00e0 une baisse de son stock de produits d'alimentation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. voulant se r\u00e9approvisionner, elle sollicite de WAGES un cr\u00e9dit pour l'achat de 15 sacs de riz, 5 bidons d'huile, 4 cartons de spaghetti et divers.","en":"Rachidatou T., married with one child, lives with her family in Totsi, a suburb of Lome.

Cristina es una mujer trabajadora ella tambi\u00e9n elabora y vende comidas r\u00e1pidas, empanadas, cariba\u00f1olas, arepas, frutas, jugos y bolis, ese fue precisamente  el negocio con el cual inici\u00f3 su microempresa hace 7 a\u00f1os, como mecanismo para solventar las necesidades b\u00e1sicas del hogar, alimentaci\u00f3n, servicios y el alquiler de su vivienda que aun no la tenia.

","en":"Christina R. is a woman who, with her business, resolves domestic problems for housewives. She recognized that these housewives spend a lot of time washing clothing by hand in the harsh sun of the Caribbean Coast, which is difficult work.  For this reason, she believed that a business renting washers to housewives in her neighborhood would offer them convenience in their washing tasks and save them time so they could carry out their other domestic chores and productive activities.  Christina is a hardworking woman who also makes and sells fast food: empanadas, cariba\u00f1olas (boiled yucca stuffed with meat), arepas (corn bread), fruit juice and bolis (frozen juice snacks.)  She started this small business 7 years ago as a way to cover the basic household expenses: food, utilities and the rent on her home, as she did not own a home.  With her first loan from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo 5 years ago, she was able to get some better tools and acquire a pedicab that transports 4 people at a low cost for her husband, who was unemployed.  From that moment, they both began to work and generate income for a stable home.  This is her 4th loan, and with it she will buy 2 washing machines and supplies to make her fast food.  Christina remembers how, with her second loan, she was buying the washing machines to rent by the hour.  After 2 years, with a lot of discipline and management of the investment, they achieved profits that allowed them to save for a down payment on an apartment.  Today they have that apartment, and are currently making payments in modest quarterly installments. Now she and her husband feel very satisfied with the sacrifices they have made, and are continuing to work toward their main goal of paying off the apartment through honest work and persistence in their business.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva

He lives in his own home with his wife Valvina, age 32, and their three beloved children for whom he wants to provide a better quality of life.  Twenty years ago, N\u00e9stor received the support of his wife and decided to buy some land so that he could work and improve his family\u2019s financial situation.  He continues to work on the land, but now he is much more productive.  His crops of potatoes, peas, and corn are of very good quality, and over time, he has learned how to obtain a better production rate at harvest time.  What he enjoys most is the close relationship he has with the land.  He likes watching his crops grow.  On the other hand, N\u00e9stor finds it difficult to care for his fields whenever inclement weather is present since any type of neglect can affect the harvest.  Later on he hopes to buy additional land so that he can increase his production.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is his seventh loan with MFP.  N\u00e9stor is very happy to obtain this loan since he already has an urgent need to improve his business.  He is an admired member of his Communal Bank because he always seeks to restore order at the meetings.  The loan of 3000 PEN that he requested will be used to buy more compost so that he can improve the productivity of his crops.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":567528,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase compost","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-07-15T17:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nestor ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1075}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1075,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:03:53Z","rounded_local_amount":3036.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188724907,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-07-17T19:05:31Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T14:03:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":214255,"name":"Mirtha Elizabeth","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Se\u00f1ora Mirtha  tiene 31 a\u00f1os de edad tiene dos ni\u00f1os de doce y siete a\u00f1os ella vive en la Maica Central parada seis  que es un cant\u00f3n de la ciudad de Cochabamba a unos veinte minutos de la ciudad, ella vive sola con sus hijos y con la cu\u00f1ada.\n\nMirtha es una persona responsable y trabajadora es la \u00fanica mujer de cuatro hijos los cuales salieron solos porque sus padres se divorciaron cuando eran ni\u00f1os y ella viv\u00eda con la abuela ya que la mama les  abandono  cuando su padre se fue de la ciudad entonces ellos quedaron solos, Mirtha se puso a trabajar desde muy ni\u00f1a ayudando a la abuela con la actividad de la producci\u00f3n de leche  de esa manera ella se quedo con esa actividad de producci\u00f3n de leche ella tiene tres cabezas de ganado lechero que le dan una producci\u00f3n de 60 litros diarios con los cuales ella realiza quesillo y los comercializa en el mercado, de los cuales ella paga el estudio de sus hijos y al mismo tiempo cuidad a la abuelita porque ella se encuentra delicada de salud y como es su abuela quien la ayudo a Mirtha ella dice que le debe mucho a su a abuela y tiene que ayudarla para que pueda vivir m\u00e1s.\n\nMirtha pide el cr\u00e9dito para la compra de cascara de soya, para poder aumentar la producci\u00f3n y de esa manera poder producir m\u00e1s leche y realizar m\u00e1s quesillo, con esa ayuda ella tendr\u00e1 m\u00e1s ingresos con los cuales ayudara a sus hijos en la escuela y que sus ni\u00f1os terminen y realicen una carrera  en el futuro.\n","en":"Sra.

Norma usually works alone, like she did when she first started, but she has the help of her daughter or hires a few assistants whenever she receives large orders so that she can deliver them on time.

This time, for her 14th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 50,000, which she intends to use to buy fishing gear and new multi-cab (a mini-truck) to use for her deliveries. She can then continue to save up for future house renovations.  J. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF)  is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":566344,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","use":"to

However, reason, solid judgment, quick wit and a bit of good luck strengthen that leaf, enabling it to clear hurdles and decide independently where to stop. \r\n\r\nJumabu D. is this group\u2019s leader. Fate has already tested Jumabu\u2019s character when her husband perished. People of that advanced age usually stop fighting for a better life and prefer simply to swim with the current. Jumabu would fully deserve getting such a rest and renouncing all responsibilities. After all she has not simply been working incessantly  for years, but also  managed to bring up four children. She has been able to inculcate in her children the qualities which would allow them to be successful, so that they would not embarrass Jumabu, but, on the contrary, would make Jumabu proud of them. They have grown up hard-working and respectful of their [parents]. Now all her children work and are responsible for their own lives. Her only daughter is married and lives separately. With that, Jumabu has always been for her children a caring mother, first of all, and not some kind of boss or bureaucrat. In order to avoid being a burden on her children, Jumabu still continues to work and support herself. She does the kind of work she knows and loves\u2014raising livestock. Thanks to this work they have even been able to build a house. Now Jumabu\u2019s sense of judgment tells her not to wait until she has the means but to turn for help. She is hoping to obtain this loan and to buy a foal.\r\n\r\nJumabu\u2019s partners in the group:\r\nSultanbek B. is the father of three children. He is 51 years old. In order to support his family, he raises cattle, and his wife sells milk. Sultanbek requested a loan in order to buy a dairy cow. \r\n\r\nMariya N. is 46 years old. She is the mother of five children. Her oldest son is 25 years old, and her youngest daughter is 13. Mariya raises livestock, and her children help her.

They can either break a person or make him stronger.  Luckily, the heroes of our story, as a rule, treat any trials as tests of strength and have the best ability to show it, becoming examples of strength and confidence.  Such is an example of Larisa S., for whom the loss of her husband became this trial.  After all, Larisa is a mother of two children, and life without the head of household and main breadwinner is a fairly hard hit for any person, regardless how brave he could be.  Now that her sons grew up, they learned to earn their own living.  She is now 53 years old, and Larisa still continues to work hard for the benefit of her family.  The oldest son is thirty years old.  He decided to try his luck in Russia and now works there.  The second son stayed here in Kyrgyzstan and now works at a construction site.  Larisa is involved in animal husbandry, even though it is not a typical women's trade.  Larisa takes care of the household well enough, plus, her daughter-in-law helps her.  Larisa also sells milk, which yields a monthly income of close to three thousand som.  She wants to increase the livestock headcount and needs another calf for this purpose.  She is certain that with the right care and genuine approach, everything will work out well.    \r\n   \r\nLarisa's partners are:\r\n\r\nToktobubu K. is sixty-two years old.  Together with her husband, she raised six children.  The sons left to go to Kazakhstan, and daughters got married and live separately.  In order to support themselves, Toktobubu and her husband are involved in animal husbandry.  Toktobubu needs a loan in order to buy building materials for the construction of a barn. \r\n\r\nTinatin O. is fifty-three years old.  She is divorced and has only one fourteen-year-old son.  Tinatin earns a living working as a teacher at a secondary school.  She requested this loan in order to buy a heifer for breeding.  Tinatin has many plans.  She wants to open a sewing factory and use profits from it to provide her son with good education.\r\n\r\nMaksatbek M. is forty years old.  He is married and has four children.

However, after the collapse, the Government failed to preserve production and the working process. Consequently these factories went bankrupt due to lack of strategic reformations in management and people had to adjust to a totally new reality. They had to start their lives all over again, and former engineers had to learn market economy and start trading.\r\n\r\nThe heroes of our story are former factory workers and today\u2019s entrepreneurs. Rysbubu D. is the leader of this group and is fifty. She had to raise her child on her own, as she lost her husband many years ago.\r\n\r\nIn the Soviet period, Rysbubu purchased three sheep and started breeding livestock. Now she has a decent population of livestock and her son helps her look after the livestock. When a need for money appears, she sells some of her livestock and thus meets her daily needs.\r\n\r\nRysbubu has applied for this loan as she wants to purchase three sheep to raise. She hopes to save enough funds to pay for her son\u2019s marriage.\r\n\r\nRysbubu\u2019s partners:\r\n\r\nEmilbek S., 50, has a daughter and his wife is engaged in selling industrial products and foodstuffs. Emilbek is occupied with breeding livestock and hopes to obtain this loan to buy construction materials for a temporary building.\r\n\r\nKuluipa A., 57, is a widow and is engaged in raising and selling livestock. Her son also helps her look after the livestock. Kuluipa would like to buy five more sheep and has therefore applied for this loan.\r\n\r\nSyinat O., 57, is a widow and, to provide for herself and her son, she breeds livestock. She needs a loan to buy five more sheep for sending them to summer pasture. She hopes that by means of livestock breeding, she will be able to build a house for her son.\r\n\r\nGulzamira S., 53, is a widow who earns her livelihood by breeding livestock. Many years ago she bought four sheep and five goats and, since then, livestock has been her main source of income. Now, she hopes to obtain this loan to buy two sheep.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---<\/b>\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of the 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable in order to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

San N. earns a living by raising pigs in a pigpen behind her house.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

is Rodel D., 40, resident of Silang, Cavite, Philippines. He is married to Rosanna D., a variety store owner, and is the father of two children, both of whom are already in college. By the grace of God, Rodel has managed to support his children's schooling up to the college level. This is a dream come true for most Filipino parents like Rodel, as he himself has been to college and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents can leave to their children.\r\n\r\nRodel operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store selling groceries, toiletries and beverages in the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 Philippine pesos (PHP) worth of cooking oil or an egg. Rodel earns money by buying supplies at wholesale prices and selling them retail. \r\n\r\nRodel\u2019s edge over other competitors is that he also owns a videoke machine (a karaoke with a television displaying entertaining scenery and song lyrics) alongside his store. Filipinos never miss an opportunity to sing, and a videoke session is what many Filipinos do to pass time and have fun. Rodel\u2019s store is located next to his house. His regular customers are his neighbors and the local community.  He earns a minimum of 200 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help him continue the operation of his business, Rodel is requesting a 18,000 PHP loan. He will be using the loan to buy more products like groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand his product inventory. He expects a boost in his business income as he expands his business. \r\n\r\nRodel dreams of being able to give his children a high quality education through all his hard work in the business. He also hopes to have his house renovated by the end of the year. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":567883,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy more groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand his product inventory","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Silang, Cavite","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2010-07-14T04:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rodel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":18000,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":4500,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:43:30Z","rounded_local_amount":4626.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159608180,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:56:59Z","rounded_local_amount":3084.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166821691,"comment":null},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":3750,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:53:08Z","rounded_local_amount":3855.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172088935,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:20:56Z","rounded_local_amount":3084.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177380304,"comment":null},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":3750,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-16T11:02:40Z","rounded_local_amount":3855.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182816659,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-07-16T12:16:29Z","paid_date":"2010-12-16T11:02:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":214425,"name":"Saodat","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"M.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

P., a 43-year-old resident of Silang, Cavite, Philippines. She is married to Orlando D. P., a seaman. She is the mother of two children, one of whom is still in elementary school, while one is currently enrolled in college. By the grace of God, Merlita has managed to support her children\u2019s schooling. At this time, she is working hard to send one of them to college -- a dream for most poor Filipino parents like Merlita, as she herself has been a college undergraduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents could leave to their children.\r\n\r\nMerlita manages a retail store attached to her house and sells groceries, condiments and beverages to her neighbors as customers. She also maintains a direct-selling business. She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products through popular direct-selling brands like Avon, Fullerlife, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and others. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealer\u2019s prices are lower than those in the catalog, and these are the profits that dealers are counting on as their income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 200 Philippine pesos (Php) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a Php20,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy orders for her customers. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n \r\nMerlita dreams to be able to give her all her children a good and high-quality education through all her hard work in her business. She also hopes that this year, her husband will be able to work again outside the country as a seaman.

She is married to Almario B., a businessman. She is the mother of two children, both of whom are still in elementary school. Carolyn hopes that, with the grace of God, she will be able to support her children's education until they reach their college years. It is a dream for most Filipino parents like Carolyn as she herself is a college undergraduate and believes that this is the best inheritance parents can leave to their children.\r\n\r\nCarolyn operates a junk shop. Trash is not actively segregated in the Philippines and, while waiting for their local dump trucks, people scavenge garbage dumps and trash bags for recyclable materials like metal, copper, plastic and paper. They sell these to junk shops like Carolyn\u2019s for a little profit. Junk shops then stack, clean and gather huge quantities of these materials and sell them back to foundries like factories. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php200 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her to continue operating her business, she is requesting a Php15,000 loan.

Ligaya","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Ma. Ligaya B., 40, a resident of Silang, Cavite, Philippines. She is married to Rosendo B., a contractor. She is the mother of four children, two of whom are in high school while the other two are still in elementary schools. By the grace of God, Ligaya has managed to support her children's schooling. At this time, she is working hard to be able to send them all the way through college. This is a dream for most Filipino parents like Ligaya as she herself is college graduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents can leave to their children.\r\n\r\nMa. Ligaya operates a junk shop and a retail store. She is also a fruit dealer, buying fruit wholesale and retailing it in the market. Trash is not actively segregated in the Philippines and, while waiting for their local dump trucks, people scavenge garbage dumps and trash bags for recyclable materials like metal, copper, plastic and paper. They sell these to junk shops like Juanita\u2019s for a little profit. Junk shops then stack, clean and gather huge quantities of these materials and sell them back to foundries like factories. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php200, 300, and 350 in sales every day in the junk shop, retail store and fruit vending business respectively.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a Php48,000 loan.

is Erlinda B., 47, a resident of GMA, Cavite, Philippines. She has one child with whom she lives. \r\n\r\nErlinda operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil or an egg. Juanita earns a living by getting supplies at wholesale price and selling at piece rate. Erlinda\u2019s store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.

She herself has been a college undergraduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents could leave to their children.\r\n\r\nMercelita operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go for buying one sachet of shampoo, 5 PHP-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling at piece rate. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of $4.30 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 15,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nMercelita dreams of being able to give her all her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She also hopes to have her house renovated by the end of the year. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":567921,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy more quantities of products to expand her product inventory","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"GMA, Cavite","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2010-07-14T12:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mercelita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":15000,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2010-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2010-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2010-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2010-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2010-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2010-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2010-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2010-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2010-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2010-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2010-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2010-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2010-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2010-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2010-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2010-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2010-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2010-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2010-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":625}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.55},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.55},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.55},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.55},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40.63,"local_amount":1875,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:43:36Z","rounded_local_amount":1879.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159608189,"comment":null},{"amount":54.16,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:56:49Z","rounded_local_amount":2506.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166821700,"comment":null},{"amount":94.79,"local_amount":4375,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:52:57Z","rounded_local_amount":4385.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172088944,"comment":null},{"amount":27.09,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:20:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1253.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177380313,"comment":null},{"amount":108.33,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-16T11:02:50Z","rounded_local_amount":5012.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182816667,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-07-15T15:41:27Z","paid_date":"2010-12-16T11:02:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":214450,"name":"Rosario","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Rosario B., a widow at age 43, resident of GMA, Cavite, Philippines.

She is 27 years old, and a single mother with a little boy, aged 3. She sells clothes in the nearby communities. She has been doing this work for the past 2 years, and from it she earns enough to take care of herself and her son. It was to meet the needs of her young son that Rosalinda took up this work, to be able to bring him up and give him a good education without the support of a partner. She is striving to ensure his wellbeing and that of her family, and that is why she goes out and works at growing her business day by day. Rosalinda would like to have a place where she can sell her merchandise. She also wants to save up money so she has it when she needs it, and she wants to give her son a better future in life. \r\n\r\nSeeking a loan from [field partner] FRAC, Rosalinda has formed a group called \"Las Naranjas\" (\"The Oranges\").

They live in the community of Ixtapaluca, Mexico. These are the members of the group: Araceli M. F. (snacks and perfumes sale), Laura H. G. (sewing workshop), Rosalba F. F. (clothes sale), Ver\u00f3nica M. C. (cosmetics sale by order) and Alejandro Ju\u00e1rez L\u00f3pez (costume jewelry sale).\r\n\r\nAraceli F. represents the group: she is 35 years old, she has two children attending primary and secondary school and has been engaged in trading for 13 years, as she is likes being able to count on her own earnings so that she can help her father and help covering for the expenses of her house. She currently sells snacks such as peanuts, pistachios, wine gums, sweets and so on, and she has just started selling perfumes. Every three days, Araceli goes around her community selling her products door to door, and the week-end is when she makes the most out of her sales. Areceli wishes for her children to finish school and have a career, because she did not have the chance to do it; at the same time she wishes to extend her house and gain more space for her family. The loan she is requesting will be used to buy perfumes and snacks in order to gain more customers.\r\n\r\nEvery member has different plans and expectations, but they all wish to make their dreams come true, and they are thankful to Kiva for the support it offers them through Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Emanuela Villa, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1650,"image":{"id":564339,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy snacks, perfumes and other different core products to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Ixtapaluca, Estado de Mexico","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2010-07-18T21:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Araceli","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Laura ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosalba ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Veronica ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alejandro ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":21000,"loan_amount":1650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1631.63},{"due_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1960.62},{"due_date":"2010-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2005.94},{"due_date":"2010-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2052.31},{"due_date":"2010-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2099.75},{"due_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2148.29},{"due_date":"2010-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2197.95},{"due_date":"2010-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":2248.76},{"due_date":"2010-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":2300.75},{"due_date":"2010-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":2354}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.2},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.05},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":157.61},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":161.25},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":164.98},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":168.8},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":172.69},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":176.69},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":180.77},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":184.96}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":128.2,"local_amount":1631.63,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:17:22Z","rounded_local_amount":1642.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159639961,"comment":null},{"amount":311.66,"local_amount":3966.56,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:21:17Z","rounded_local_amount":3993,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166854244,"comment":null},{"amount":342.36,"local_amount":4357.25,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:11:11Z","rounded_local_amount":4386.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172121141,"comment":null},{"amount":152.67,"local_amount":1943.1,"processed_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:25:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1956.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177415194,"comment":null},{"amount":172.69,"local_amount":2197.95,"processed_date":"2010-10-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:26:18Z","rounded_local_amount":2212.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177415195,"comment":null},{"amount":389.95,"local_amount":4962.94,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:16:10Z","rounded_local_amount":4996.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182554916,"comment":null},{"amount":152.47,"local_amount":1940.57,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:17:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1953.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188691431,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-07-19T15:32:24Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T13:17:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":214472,"name":"Jairo Enrique","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Hace 22 a\u00f1os, de manera casual y por la necesidad del momento, en que no trabajaba y estudiaba arquitectura, hizo sus primeras camisetas y dese entonces se ha dedicado a la confecci\u00f3n de ropa en tejido de punto.

S.] did not work and studied architecture on a casual basis.  It was then that he manufactured his first t-shirts and has been sewing garments ever since.   He started with a single sewing machine and gradually increased his number, as his sales increased, so that he could increase his efficiency and the quality of his products.  He now has 12 machines.\r\n\r\nAnd so began Jairo J. S.'s business.  He now sews alongside his wife, who was once a secretary, but now works exclusively in this business.  She does the measuring and hiring, and he primarily does the design work, cutting, printing, and sales.  His customers include prominent schools in the city of Barranquilla, for whom he makes sweaters, sweatshirts; and everything having to do with sports, which is his business' specialty.\r\n\r\nJairo, along with his wife's support, has managed to move his family ahead.  His family includes his three children, ages 15, 17, and 21.  He hopes that he will one day be able to see them all have professional careers.\r\n\r\nHe is requesting a loan in the amount of 1.355.500 COP ($725), through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo because his son is going to begin studying to become a lawyer.  This will be his sixth loan though this organization and he feels that things have gone well, because he has managed to provide his children with a primary education.\r\n\r\nJairo tells us that the global economy has been a great setback to him, especially because of the Chinese merchandise that has entered the market.  Their t-shirts are very inexpensive, but the ones he and his family manufacture are of better quality.  Aside from Jario, his wife, and daughters, his mother and several employees also work in production.  He is constantly looking for strategies to keep all of his machines producing, creating work, earning money, and providing for his family's (and his own) well being.\r\n\r\nJario is a member of a loving family and is also a good artist who proudly displays his paintings on the walls of his home. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Hugo Reyes, Kiva

They live together in her parents' house.  For the past two years she's been selling food from a small stall that she set up close to her home.  Ever since then, beginning at noon, she begins selling food.  Her mother is her primary helper, whether it includes food preparation or tending to customers.  She says that she enjoys the work she does, especially because she earns the income she needs to support her son.  Another advantage this business gives her is that she is able to care for her son.\r\n\r\nNow, she would like to improve her establishment and customer service.  This will be her first loan through MFP and she is very happy, knowing that she has financial support and she is grateful to be a part of a communal group because all of its members are very responsible and supportive.

It is located in the community of Jaloxtoc, in the state of Morelos, Mexico. The group has 6 members who know each other because they live in the same neighborhood. This is their first loan with the Realidad Foundation. \r\n\r\nThe group's representative is Rocio M. C.. She is 37 years old and has been educated through the 6th year of primary school. She has four children, three boys and one girl; Eduardo is 20, Edgar is 17, Luis Francisco is 9, and Carmen is 23. Rocio's business is selling soft drinks as well as beauty products for women. With her loan, she will buy soft drinks, perfumes, deodorants, lipstick, gloss, earrings, purses, etc. Her business is located in her home in Jaloxtoc. She started it one year ago, because she likes to sell things and earn money to buy more stock. Previously, on Saturdays and Sundays she sold pozole (a soup), tostadas and pan-heated and fried tacos, but her husband had an accident and she stopped selling. There are times when she has to go out with her husband for his therapy sessions. Her business is important to her, because she was able to cover her family's expenses when her husband became ill. With her profits, she can keep buying more merchandise to keep selling and also support her household. Her dreams are to expand her store, so it will be larger and well-stocked, and also that her youngest son will be able to attend the university and have the chance to pursue a career. The challenges she has faced include stopping her sales of pozole and tacos on Saturdays, because her husband had an accident and she had to take care of him and sometimes go out to medical checkups.\r\n\r\nAnother member of the group is Juana M. M., who will use the funds from the loan to buy pants, blouses, skirts, socks and underwear. Rocio M. C. will buy flavored soft drinks in 2-liter and 500-ml bottles to stock her business. Maria O. M. will buy women's and men's perfumes and colognes, lipstick, deodorants, and mascara. Juana A. V. will buy soft drinks by the case in 2-liter and 1.5-liter bottles, as well as juices. Alma Delia J. V. will buy popsicles, gum, pork rinds, chocolates, etc. to start her business. Paula V. A. will buy two sheep, male and female, so she can start breeding them. \r\n\r\nThe group members would like to say to Kiva and to the Realidad Foundation: \"Thank you for having granted the loan to us, and we hope you will continue helping more people who need it, and that more loans will be granted, but without raising the interest rate; thank you!\"

She has devoted herself to farming since she was a child.  From then on she has continued to cultivate the fields that she inherited from her parents.  The products she plants primarily are potatoes and corn.  She also grows some vegetables like onions, lettuce, and carrots.  After the harvest she takes her products to sell to the merchants at the different markets in her area.  \r\n\r\nHer three children help her with the whole cultivation process.  The plants need to be taken care of and fertilized.  This way she saves the labor costs.  In previous years the planting did not go very well for her due to weather changes.  In spite of this difficulty, she always has food available to feed her family.  Also, with part of the harvest she prepares food.  The food is later sold close to her house every afternoon.

The group has five members, all acquaintances, and this is their first loan with Kiva partner Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad. \r\n\r\nThe group's leader is Cristina Col\u00edn R.; she is 26 years old, has finished 6th grade, and has three kids: two boys, Gerardo (6) and Leonardo (1) and a girl, Jazmin (8). \r\n\r\nCristina just inherited some land from her father. The place is very pretty, with temperate climate and close to the forest. There are hills close by, which the rain makes green. In this new land, Cristina just started a new business growing edible cactuses (nopales), which she sells at the wholesale market. Many buyers go from city to city with large trucks to transport the nopales. \r\n\r\nCristina will use the loan to buy organic fertilizer for her nopales, to make them grow greener and prettier. Cristina's husband is a farmer, and will help Cristina with the nopal business. He says: \u201cThis business is important because once I harvest the nopales, I will have enough to support my family. When one works the land, one earns money to keep planting and harvesting, and to feed one's family.\" \r\n\r\nCristina hopes to have enough for her family, for their food and education. \r\n\r\nThe other members will use their loan for the following: \r\n\r\nMirella E.

This group is made up of 5 members who know each other.  This is their 12th loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad.  \r\n\r\nManuela S. S. is a member of the group.  She is 40 years old and completed her education through the 3rd year of secondary school.  She has 3 children: 2 boys and a girl.  Jose David is 11, Juan Diego is 9, and Maria Esther is 7 years old.  She sells pottery.  She will use this loan to stock up on clay and firewood, since these items become scarce during the rainy season.  She works by advance orders, and her customers are from Tlayacapan.  The pieces she makes from clay are pedestals to put flowers on, lamp bases, and large sets of bottles.  She started her business 14 years ago.  She comments that it runs in her family; her father taught her to work with clay.  She is proud of her pottery business, since at times she makes a religious commitment to decorate the church with pedestals for flowers or candelabras for the wax candles on August 24th, when they celebrate Saint Bartolo.  She has had setbacks, such as when the clay fails to resist the fire and the pieces break.  Manuela tells us \"my business is important for me, because with the earnings I am able to cover the household expenses, the educational expenses for my children, and I can continue to buy merchandise in order to keep working.\"  The members of the group are: Petra Constantina V. M., Luisa S. Gonz\u00e1lez, Maura A. V. and Manuela S..

He provides taxi service everyday, and he works 12 hours a day.  He has spent 15 years being at the wheel.  In all of that time he has gotten experiences that he shares with his friends.\r\n\r\nAfter a time of working for himself he decided to join a fleet of taxis in the city.  He did this because they are used more frequently and because they offer better security.  He knows all of the routes to the south and north of the city.  He uses the best routes during traffic hours so that he can provide his passengers with appropriate service.\r\n\r\nHe likes his work because it is peaceful and he arranges his schedules.  Sometimes he runs the risk of assaults or robbery, but the experience has allowed him to meet the random passengers that he transports.  In the future he plans to keep working as he has done.  This way he expects to be able to finish the payments on his car. \r\n\r\nThis is his twelfth loan with MFP.  He will be responsible like he was on the previous occasions.  Also, he is very grateful for all of the people who made the requested money possible.

The group is made up of five women who know each other.  This is their second loan with Fundacion Realidad (\"Reality Foundation\").\r\n\r\nOne member of the group is Noralit M. H..  She is 29 years old.  She went to school through the sixth grade.  She has three children; Odalys is two years old, Meraris is 4, and Luis Gadiel is 7.  The oldest, Luis, is in school.  The second son is about to begin kindergarten.  Noralit sells Tupperware and Jafra brand beauty products by mail order.  She is going to use the loan to order Tupperware, perfume, and cosmetics so she can have merchandise to sell in the communities of Amayuca, Jantetelco, and San Juan Amecac. \r\n\r\nHer husband helps her with the business by watching their children in the afternoon when she goes out to sell her merchandise.  Sometimes her husband joins her on the bus when she travels to different communities.  Noralit likes her job because she can work and take care of her children. \r\n\r\nThanks to her business, Noralit has extra money to cover unexpected costs.  There are times when her husband is out of work, and the money saved from her business can cover household costs.  There are months when business is slow and sales are low and Noralit has to work harder to reach the sales goal she set.  An example of this is at the beginning of the school year when sales are low.  Noralit saves her money as she makes it so she has enough to cover unforeseen costs like when a child gets sick and needs to see the doctor and get medicine.\r\n\r\nNoralit will use the loan to buy Tupperware and Jafra cosmetics to sell.  Noralit is planning to grow her business, cover a larger sales area, be a sponsor, and form various groups of people and teach them how to work.\r\n\r\nAnother member of the group, Gregoria A. C., will use the loan to buy soap, eggs, milk, and sugar to stock her grocery store.  Janet V. A. will buy chicken legs, which she will boil and sell, and corncobs.  Barbara D.
