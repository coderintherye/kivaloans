She completed her education through 5th standard, but she couldn\u2019t study further because her school was based on 1st standard through 5th standard. For 6th standard she had to enroll in secondary school, but her father couldn\u2019t admit her because of the high fees charged by the school. Shaheen baji got married to a man whose name is A. G., and he is a driver by profession. He has driven an auto-rickshaw (a local three-wheeled motor vehicle) for the last five years. Driving an auto-rickshaw became her family's business. Her first two sons are also drivers of auto-rickshaws. Shaheen baji has successfully repaid her first loan from Asasah (a microfinance institute of Pakistan). Now she is applying for a loan to repair her sons' auto-rickshaws so that they will be able to continue their work and earn income. \r\n\r\nShe is the group leader of more women from her locality. Saima baji wants a loan to buy paints to sell. Hanifan baji wants a loan to buy plastic utensils to sell. Zeb-un-Nisa baji wants a loan to buy supplies (chairs, razors and mirror) for her salon. Mumtaz baji wants a loan to buy a lath machine. \r\n\r\nThis is a group loan. The loan funds will be distributed among the group members, each of whom will invest in her own business. The members mutually guarantee one another's loans. If one member does not repay, the other members are responsible.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":289237,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Vehicle

She has to carry modern styles to have repeat customers, so Rahbarjon goes two or three times per month to Byshkek or Istaravshan for the new seasonal and modern assortment. \r\n<p>\r\nRahbarjon has been engaged in the commercial service trade for three years and she dreams of a good trade outlet opening where she may sell her goods. Rhbarjon applies to Kiva for a business-support loan of 1600 STJ for six months to rent a new trade outlet in the central crowed bazaar that will permit her to increase inventory turnover and attract new clients."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":289262,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To rent a new trade outlet in the central crowed bazaar","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Gafurov","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.217778 69.725","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":"2009-03-17T20:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rahbarjon","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":1600,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":320},{"due_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":320},{"due_date":"2009-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":320},{"due_date":"2009-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":320},{"due_date":"2009-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":320}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":89.99,"local_amount":320,"processed_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T22:07:01Z","rounded_local_amount":337.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36016014,"comment":null},{"amount":90,"local_amount":320,"processed_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:14:19Z","rounded_local_amount":337.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44599741,"comment":null},{"amount":90,"local_amount":320,"processed_date":"2009-06-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:58:34Z","rounded_local_amount":337.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52994183,"comment":null},{"amount":90.01,"local_amount":320,"processed_date":"2009-07-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-06T11:02:49Z","rounded_local_amount":337.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63215463,"comment":null},{"amount":90,"local_amount":320,"processed_date":"2009-08-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-10T10:27:04Z","rounded_local_amount":337.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73644957,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-03-18T01:07:09Z","paid_date":"2009-10-10T10:27:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":95656,"name":"Enriqueta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Enriqueta S., a mother of 10, presently resides at Old Road, Waterfall Balingsag, Misamis Oriental in the Southern Philippines.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. \r\n<p>\r\nCustoms and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":289284,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To

She has six children, three of which are still in school.  She became a member of the TYM Fund in 2003, and thanks to the effective use of her loans the family\u2019s income has increased significantly since then.  This has allowed Mrs. K. and her husband to better provide for their children\u2019s lives and education.  Currently, the income of the family consists of an average of 25,000 VND (1.50 USD) per day from weaving straw mats and her husband\u2019s monthly earnings as a laborer of 2,000,000 VND (119 USD).  In addition, they receive some support from their grown children.  In the next round of lending, she and her husband hope to borrow 8,000,000 VND (475 USD) to buy pigs to raise.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by Robert Sides, Kiva

Because the income of a farmer is not enough for his living expenses, he wants to buy necessary things for the land to increase his income. \r\n\r\n\r\nSo he contacted AFSG and he requested to take 50,000 AF as a loan for 27 months.

As a result, she has been able to buy herself a plot of land and pay fees for her children. \r\n<p>\r\nHarriet needs a loan to be able to buy more charcoal for her business.

In 2005, together with her mother, she began to run a bread-sales business. Her mother bakes bread at home and Delgermaa sells it at her small booth in the local market. \r\n<p>\r\nTo expand this tiny business, in 2007 Delgermaa took a loan with XacBank, Kiva's partner microfinance institution in Mongolia. With the help of the loan, she began to sell many small items, such as instant noodle soup, biscuits and cookies, at her booth. With her profit she bought a bigger oven, allowing her mother to bake more bread. The mother-daughter team now distributes some of the bread to local grocery stores. All their bread sells out every day, as the bread is very delicious. Delgermaa is locally respected for her business and for her friendly, hard-working personality. \r\n<p>\r\nWith this loan, Delgermaa will invest in her business and buy flour. She says, in Mongolian, \"I'm planning to have my own bakery in near future.\"\r\n

G. is a married man who lives with his family in Hentiy, one of Mongolia's southern provinces. During the last 10 years, he has been running a furniture business. He makes doors for \"gers\" (Mongolian traditional nomadic housing), tables, beds, iron stoves and stove chimneys. There is high demand for these products as many Mongolians continue to live in traditional gers, heating them with small coal stoves against the frigid winter nights. He has many repeat customers as his furniture is well built. With his profits from the last 10 years, he has purchased his own plot of land, bought new furniture for his home and purchased a motorcycle.

S. is married to Romeo S.. They are both 46 years old. They live happily in a rural place located at Barangay Tuao North, Bagabag, Nueva Vizcaya. They are blessed with two children who are presently studying in the elementary level of education. As parents, it is their responsibility to send their children to school, hence, they need to work hard in order to provide the school needs of their children.\r\n<p>\r\nThe common source of their income is through woodcraft or furniture making of tables, cabinets, 'sala' sets and other types of furniture. In the business they manage, the couple earn a net income of only 400 pesos weekly (roughly $US8) because they pay hired workers in the shop who help in making furniture for sale. The couple plans to improve their business in order to increase their income and also to help other unemployed workers out with educational attainment to support their families, too. However, the couple lacks the needed capital. \r\n<p>\r\nLearning about ASKI, the micro-finance institution providing the loan, Amelia came to realize that their plans are possible. She applied for a loan of 10,000 pesos for their furniture business. She is so glad for this opportunity and hopes for the progress of her business.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":288167,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture

She gets her products through the farmers.  \r\n<p>\r\nShe is now asking for financial assistance of PHP 7,000.00 so she can buy sacks of calamansi at a wholesale price that she can sell in the market. She has been in this business for four years and is still doing great.  \u201cJust be patient and always persevere for the better to become successful entrepreneur and always pray to God to direct and light our path,\u201d said Juliet.\r\n

Providing their needs for farm inputs and allowances of their children is too hard for the couple thus Rogelyn decided to help her husband to earn a living in order to satisfy their basic needs, especially the school needs of their two children. She plans to engage in hog-raising since farming is a seasonal business, using the amount she is able to borrow from  lenders, at least PHP 5,000. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":288589,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Business Capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Aritao, Nueva Vizcaya","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":123,"posted_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rogelyn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":5000,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":5000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":125,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T10:39:58Z","rounded_local_amount":6069.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73540042,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-04-01T18:55:07Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T10:39:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":95745,"name":"Amir","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Amir M. is a farmer who dedicates himself to the business of farming and livestock raising.

Jocelyn helps her husband earn an income by maintaining her poultry and vending businesses. <P>\r\n\r\nJocelyn sells meat products in their village.  She roams from one house to another to offer her products.  Aside from meat vending, she also raises poultry such as native chickens and ducks.  Her weekly net income out of her businesses is averaging PHP 1,000.  She budgets her income for their daily food and immediate needs at home.  Her business has been a great assistance to their daily living. <P>\r\n\r\nTo further sustain the businesses, Jocelyn thought of asking for financial support from lenders.  She would like to borrow the amount of PHP  7,000 that she can use as additional capital. Jocelyn is hoping to become successful in her business someday so it would be easy for them to send their son to school in the future.  \u201cJust believe and put God first before anything else,\u201d

Being an extraordinary entrepreneur, she was able to manage at least three simple businesses such as buying and selling frozen foods, food vending and direct selling of personal collection of AVON and NATASHA products for men and women. <P>\r\n\r\nWith those businesses, Beatriz is able to earn a weekly net income of PHP 1,000 that she uses to support the education of her youngest child.  She is now borrowing an additional capital of PHP 5,000 to maintain her small businesses.  She is thankful that her husband is very supportive to her business undertakings; that makes her inspired every time.

N., 41, is the proud mother of 21-year-old and 18-year-old daughters. She lives with her husband and children in the Chingeltei district of Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. In 1999, with her husband, she began to rent a small candy stall in Narantuul market, the largest open-air market in Ulaanbaatar. When she started the candy business, she had only 250,000 MNT in capital ($1=1,600 MNT). Today, thanks to the steady growth of her business, she has diversified her products. She now sells candies, fruits and vegetables and her capital has increased to 1,300,000 MNT. Her husband also has begun to run a small retail shop for various consumer products.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  hese conditions have created high levels of unemployment and forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a solid business proposition.

Khusein lives in a community that lacks industrial and commercial jobs. Due to these circumstances, he decided to become self-employed and thus not have to emigrate to Russia. He started selling different kinds of tubes like pipes, culverts, drainpipes, and also fittings and channels. \r\n<p>\r\nSoon he became known in his community and now he has many clients. Khusein tells us that he has many pending orders. This is the reason he is asking for a loan of $3,000 that he will pay back in 12 months. With this money, Khusein will be able to buy more merchandise in order to have a larger variety and fulfill his pending orders. With your help, Khusein and his family will be able to get ahead.  \r\n<p>\r\n More about Tajikistan\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes being a key post along the Silk Road and being the location of the end of the rule of Alexander the Great. It is also known for its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi, and many others. The country, filled with epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and boasts a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nMore about IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, its culture is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions. However, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and its manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History \r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is married and is the mother of a two-year old. Her husband, a farmer by profession, does not completely cover all household expenses. To address this situation, she started selling meat products such as: sausages, frankfurters and chicken. She was successful in saving a little money and invested it in expanding her business. She has a lot of experience after 5 years in this kind of business. Warmly accommodating and innately moral, Marohat is requesting a loan of $800 USD to buy more chicken and sausage to meet customer demands. The success of this project will help her family to fully thrive where health, nourishment, schooling, and clothing are concerned. \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and for it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She started her business out of economic pressure six years ago, as her husband\u2019s salary wasn\u2019t enough to cover the family\u2019s expenses. She began to investigate the types of work she could do, and one of her friends recommended that she sell children\u2019s clothing. She decided to try it.

It served as a key post along the Silk Road and marked the end of Alexander the Great's extensive rule. It was the birthplace of the great Persian poet Rudaki and famous Islamic philosopher Ibn Sina. And it is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.<P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

In the future, she wants to start another business. \r\n\r\nIn the meantime she will continue dedicating herself to cattle-raising.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Leocadia thanks you for her support!\r\n\t\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

After having achieved a degree in accounting from an private school, she now works at the city hall of her town as an assistant accountant.  Her parents makes a living by farming and they also owns a grocery store, but they are now going through severe difficulties because the price of fertilizer went up by a lot and they were not able to buy enough.  For this reason, their crops are suffering.  Also, the store that they own is not well stocked since her mother is feeling very worried because of the crops.  Carmen believes that she can help her parents by increasing the amount of products in the store and by making it a profitable business.  She wants her younger siblings to have the same opportunities that she had to get an education.  She is convinced that by increasing the amount of products at the store, they will be able to attract more customers.  Carmen's plans are to continue to work with the hope that her contract at her job will be renewed for another six months so that she can help her parents and her younger siblings.  This is the first loan that she is requesting through MFP.  She hopes to work with this communal bank and she promises to make her loan payments on time.

She has been married for 11 years and has a daughter.  From a young age she has dedicated herself to farming as her parents were farmers.  At that time they planted potatoes and peas. Ten years ago she ventured into growing vegetables at the ranch that she inherited from her parents.  She also rents additional land to cultivate flowers.  The sale of flowers is very profitable for her during the months of May and November but in the remaining months she dedicates herself more to her farming.  Every 15 days or at the end of the month she sends her products to the markets.  Depending on the prices, she will sell in her same area or will take her products to the city of Lima.  This time, her sister and her husband took Carmen's products to the market in the area while Carmen took care of her niece.  Carmen tries not to miss any of the meetings at her community bank which is one of the reasons why she could not go with her husband to the market to sell her products. \r\n\r\nThis is Carmen's 11th loan with MFP and in all of this time she has been responsible and has worked and paid her payments.

In the early years of her marriage Haydee continued raising these crops, but she doesn't particularly enjoy farming.\r\n\r\nWhen her daughter was born five years ago, Haydee convinced her husband to open a bodega. He did, agreeing to take charge of the crops while Haydee cares for the children and tends to the store. Since that time, Haydee has spent all of her time and effort on the store, which has grown a client base over the years. This motivates Haydee to continue investing and working on it. She is very happy with her business, because now when the crop fails or market prices are down her store is able to cover the family's basic expenses. \r\n\r\nHaydee is president of her community bank, in charge of organizing member meetings in extreme cases and staying in tune with the involvement of the group.

They rent their home. Years ago, Jes\u00fas used to work as a day laborer, plowing the fields. He earned between 50 and 80 soles per day, depending on the work. Ever since he started a family, Jes\u00fas began to plant potatoes, peas, and corn on rented farmland. He's found this work to be profitable, more so than his work as a day laborer. This income has allowed him to improve his personal finances. \r\n\r\nIn his eagerness to improve his quality of life, Jes\u00fas planted a large quantity of corn a few months ago. This has motivated him to do business in the Capital. Ever since then, he's sent 3500 kilos of corn with each load. This has given him an incentive to keep planting and to invest more in this crop, because he is happy to have started this business. In spite of his hard work on the farm, Jes\u00fas attends all of the community bank meetings, and when he's away he leaves his wife in charge of repayments because he doesn't like to fall behind. This is his 11th loan with MFP, and he feels proud to be part of the community bank. He'll use the money to buy synthetic fertilizers, as well as corn to seed the fields.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Sarah Bishop, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":289583,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Buy synthetic fertilizers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-03-22T12:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jesus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":224.81,"local_amount":691.74,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:30:16Z","rounded_local_amount":715.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640675,"comment":null},{"amount":66.41,"local_amount":204.34,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:42:50Z","rounded_local_amount":211.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080176,"comment":null},{"amount":0.93,"local_amount":2.85,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:18:18Z","rounded_local_amount":2.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996467,"comment":null},{"amount":0.96,"local_amount":2.95,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:22Z","rounded_local_amount":3.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103841975,"comment":null},{"amount":31.89,"local_amount":98.12,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:07:36Z","rounded_local_amount":101.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110733756,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

He inherited his farm from his parents, who planted peas and vegetables according to the season. The crop depends on the seasons, and his parents taught Robert how to plant accordingly. With these concepts in mind Robert began to plant, but his crop didn't do well. He tried planting flowers, but this also failed. Nevertheless, four years ago a friend proposed that Robert plant chamomile in his fields, and this crop has been profitable, because there is no competition. Robert harvests the chamomile every three months, in April, July, and November. This means that he must invest a lot of money in labor, in order to transplant,harvest, fertilize, and fumigate. Each of these jobs costs between 200 and 300 soles. Robert invested 1500 soles in this last harvest, hoping to earn five times as much. In order to realize his dreams he has to go to a lot of trouble to fertilize and cultivate large quantities of chamomile. He's now asking for a loan to buy fertilizers, which will help improve his crop and earn the projected amount of profits. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Sarah Bishop, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":289586,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Buy fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-03-23T03:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Robert","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":475}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":105.5,"local_amount":333.17,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:08:34Z","rounded_local_amount":335.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110733757,"comment":null},{"amount":369.5,"local_amount":1166.83,"processed_date":"2010-01-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1175.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118123938,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-03-23T06:26:37Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":95863,"name":"Juana Renee","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Juana  es socia del Banco Comunal Guadalupe.\nJuana  es casada, tiene 54 a\u00f1os y 3 hijos, Juana es T\u00e9cnica de Enfermer\u00eda y trabaja en el Hospital, tambi\u00e9n tiene un kiosco cerca al mercado Magdalena, donde todos los d\u00edas con la ayuda de sus hijos vende comida y bebidas.

Our eco-village is very poor because of the conflict that reigned for a long time in this part of the country and also because of the wrecked ship, which used to ensure the link with the continent.  Since then, we have lived in absolute poverty while trying to lift ourselves out of it with the few means we have.  We have therefore come to request a loan from Kiva to be able to market seafood products, grain, and fruit and vegetables that are produced here and that we\u2019ll be able to buy from growers for resale in the big cities.  The seafood and woodland goods that are produced on the islands are highly sought after on the continent.  The sale of these goods in cities will enable us to buy grain and various home items that we\u2019ll be able to resell in our area and on surrounding islands.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

The peasants walk four hours daily to arrive in Lares, where they make their purchases at the markets and also take their products to sell. <p>\r\nThis group is very pretty and typical of the region, and they still maintain their Incan ancestry in their traditional dresses and customs, their lifestyles and folkloric live dances. The members are very humble, but they are filled with courage and tenderness. They work on the land, producing different varieties of potatoes and maize (white, yellow, multicolored). But most of all they are the best weavers in the Cusco valley. They have a very distinct technique and make scarfs, blankets, lace, ponchos, caps and beautiful works depicting nature. All of this is done by hand and with natural dyes. All of what they know they learned from their ancestors, and this knowledge is passed on from generation to generation. It also allows them to participate in the tourism industry, and they are very friendly people who want to share and keep their traditions alive. <p>\r\nWith the loan, the members will purchase seeds for their new crops, some heads of cattle for livestock, and alpaca and sheep fleece so their wives can continue weaving. They also want to build some rooms so they will be able to receive visitors and provide accommodations. <p>\r\nThe members are very grateful for the granted loan. For them this is a new experience, since previously none of them have had to the opportunity to work with credit. They are anxious to invest the money and see the results.

At 36 years of age, she has formed a family and is its primary breadwinner. She lives in a rented house and has not lost hope of improving her economic situation. She passes the days surrounded by her beloved animals. She works very hard to ensure that her livestock eat well and grow up healthy, then takes them to the Sunday market and sells them in hopes of getting a good price for her animals, and she nearly always does since hers are the largest in the market. What she loves most about her work is that she can spend her days in the country she loves so much, breathing clean air. She has spent 10 years in this business and plans to continue doing so as long as it takes to give her family a better life. What she likes the least about her work is chasing after lambs that escape and run very far from the herd. Basilia wishes to have her own business, perhaps a grocery store or a restaurant; she still hasn't decided, but she knows that she has to work hard to improve her family's lives. This is her first loan with MFP, and she understands her responsibility to make repayments on time in order to access more loans.

What she desires most is to give them a worthy life. Gregoria has worked a lot in her life to get ahead. At a very young age, she started in the business of selling clothes, which gave her enough money to live on. Recently, she began selling sweets, walking the streets of the city of Puno in search of customers to buy her products. She is very happy and enjoys selling sweets, always convincing her customers to buy something. She hopes to have a store where she can more easily sell her merchandise and better serve her customers. She has been doing this work for eight years, and the most difficult part of it is having to quickly escape from the rains so her confections don't get wet. She wants to see her children become professionals and is ready to work hard to achieve this. This is Gregoria's second loan with MFP. She was very punctual with her first loan and hopes to be so again this time. She is very active in her communal bank, and is liked by all the other members.

During her tough economic problems, she had an idea to make pumpkin fritters (picarones), so five years ago she acquired a location outside a market and began selling pumpkin fritters.

","en":"Susana is 45 years old and lives with her husband Tom\u00e1s and her 15 year old daughter Roxana who is her principal support in her business; they live in their own house. Susana has dedicated herself to the sale of fruits for the past 9 years in the market in \u201cPachacutec\u201d, which is located in her same neighborhood given that this is her principal source of income. Her daughter Roxana helps her in this work by taking care of their stand when her mother leaves to purchase more merchandise or has some setback. Susana enjoys her work very much given that she is always in contact with people and has become good friends with her neighbors in the market. In addition, the effort that she puts forth in her job and the happiness with which she attends her customers make for good sales and give her satisfactory earnings. Like with any micro-enterprise, Susana wants to expand her business and to make it much more prosperous, for which she needs to install a new roof on her stand. Susana has worked with the MFP Bank for approximately 3 years, being a punctual client and responsible with her payments.

He is very thoughtful and concerned, and wants very much to create a good future. He raises trout, a skill he learned from his father when he was very young. He is very happy with this work, as the job brings many benefits and he has been able to support himself through it. Edgar enjoys very much taking his small boat out to his fishery, where, with much dedication, he feeds his fish. He has been in this business for 5 years, and hopes that his business will grow and he can have more fisheries in order to sell more. The most difficult part of his job is caring for the fish appropriately; if they aren't cared for correctly, their numbers will drop and his earnings will too. Edgar knows that his job is very self-sacrificing, but he is dedicated to working hard to improve his life. This is his first loan from MFP and he is very happy to have this opportunity and intends to invest the money well. He is very respected at his communal bank, and always brings order to the group. The amount he is requesting will be invested in improving his trout farm and will increase his profits.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kristen Beck, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":289869,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Improve his trout farm","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Puno","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.833333 -70.033333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-03-21T15:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edgar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:41:01Z","rounded_local_amount":92.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117279,"comment":null},{"amount":29.04,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:49:59Z","rounded_local_amount":92.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012202,"comment":null},{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:59:59Z","rounded_local_amount":92.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595783,"comment":null},{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:43:40Z","rounded_local_amount":92.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990050,"comment":null},{"amount":29.06,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:45:14Z","rounded_local_amount":92.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211183,"comment":null},{"amount":29.75,"local_amount":85,"processed_date":"2009-08-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:27:39Z","rounded_local_amount":94.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640693,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-03-21T20:02:12Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T19:27:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":95997,"name":"Mar\u00eda De Los \u00c1ngeles","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda de los \u00c1ngeles A.

A. is a woman of 26 years married to Yinier Gustavo Araya. They have a daughter whose name is Enid Sofia. They live in a small community west of San Jose called Grifo Alto Puriscal. Grifo Alto is a rural community that is approximately one hour west of San Jos\u00e9. It is a mountainous area and has a beautiful view of valleys, rivers, and mountains that overlook the Pacific coast of Costa Rica. Grifo Alto is on the road towards the beaches so many tourists stop there to eat or simply enjoy the scenery and the rural environment. \r\n\r\nThe area has many small farms for agriculture and livestock. They used to plant a lot of tobacco, but then prices dropped and people sought other options. Do\u00f1a Mar\u00eda de los Angeles has a farm of laying hens for eggs which are sold in the community. They started this business two years ago when Mar\u00eda de los \u00c1ngeles' father sold them a piece of land where they built a shed and started with 300 chicks. With the first micro loan they requested they were able to increase the number of hens to 750. Now they plan to obtain a new loan in order to get to 1000 hens and in the future increase to 1500 which is the target they have been proposed and which they think will provide a sufficient income to become the source of income for the whole family. \r\n\r\nWith the loan they are requesting they plan to buy 250 chicks, 20 bags of feed, 10 feeders, and 10 waterers. At this time Mar\u00eda de los Angeles works taking care of the chickens, feeding them, collecting the eggs, and distributing the eggs in nearby shops and houses. Her husband helps in the evenings after returning from his work. Maria de los Angeles is a member of the Community Credit Corporation of Grifo Alto Puriscal which is one of the community social organizations of EDESA. Previously she obtained a loan of six hundred thousand colones (\u00a2 600,000) which she repaid in a timely manner now that the business generates daily income.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

Margarita plans to invest the 800 soles (Peruvian currency) to buy more nets, floats, etc. to increase the quantity of her weekly catch.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Todd Schmid, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":289890,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","use":"Fishing supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Puno","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.833333 -70.033333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-03-21T16:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2009-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":135}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.72},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.72},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.72},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.72},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.72},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.4}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":45.72,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:41:25Z","rounded_local_amount":145.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117284,"comment":null},{"amount":45.71,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:49:53Z","rounded_local_amount":145.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012207,"comment":null},{"amount":45.72,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:59:40Z","rounded_local_amount":145.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595788,"comment":null},{"amount":45.72,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:43:39Z","rounded_local_amount":145.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990055,"comment":null},{"amount":45.73,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:45:10Z","rounded_local_amount":145.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211187,"comment":null},{"amount":46.4,"local_amount":135,"processed_date":"2009-08-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:28:05Z","rounded_local_amount":147.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640697,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-03-21T17:03:53Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T19:28:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":96006,"name":"Emma Rosa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":" \nEn el municipio de San Rafael del Sur de la ciudad de Managua la se\u00f1ora Emma A. se dedica a su actividad  de agricultura por medio del cultivo de la tierra en la siembra de pl\u00e1tano.\n\nEs importante destacar que actualmente ella ha logrado salir adelante en su negocio y para ello ha acudido a Ceprodel el cual le ha beneficiado arduamente en la compra de fertilizantes para sus cultivos.

Don Mart\u00edn se dedica a la agricultura y toda su familia le ayuda un poco a la hora de la siembra y la recolecta de los cultivos. \nLa comunidad en la cual vive Mart\u00edn se llama El Sauce de Santa Teresita de Turrialba. Es una peque\u00f1a comunidad rural de unos dos mil habitantes. Sus pobladores se dedican a la agricultura y a las lecher\u00edas. El Sauce tiene un relieve irregular y mucho del terreno se mantiene como bosque tropical h\u00famedo. La comunidad tiene paisajes muy pintorescos que combinan el bosque tropical con dos lindas lagunas, plantaciones de caf\u00e9 y lecher\u00edas. El Sauce se localiza aproximadamente a hora y media en bus de Turrialba, el centro de comercio m\u00e1s cercano, sin embargo varias veces al a\u00f1o, el camino se vuelve intransitable por las lluvias que caen en la zona. Este es sin duda uno de los principales desaf\u00edos para la comunidad. Cuando no exist\u00edan actividades muchas personas optaron por salir a buscar trabajos en Turrialba o en fincas bananeras ubicadas en el Atl\u00e1ntico de Costa Rica. Actualmente los precios del caf\u00e9 y la leche han mejorado por lo tanto los vecinos buscan c\u00f3mo invertir en proyectos en la misma zona.\nCon Mart\u00edn tiene un peque\u00f1o terreno de 1.2 hect\u00e1reas en el cual siembra diferentes cultivos como ma\u00edz, frijoles, pl\u00e1tano y caf\u00e9. \u00c9l tiene 27 a\u00f1os de dedicarse a la agricultura. Durante ese tiempo ha tenido \u00e9pocas en las que le va bien y otras en la que tiene que lidiar con problemas como malos precios de venta o fen\u00f3menos naturales que da\u00f1an sus cultivos.

La cosecha la espera vender en la misma finca. \nDon Mart\u00edn es cliente de la Asociaci\u00f3n de Productores de El Sauce, una organizaci\u00f3n local socia de la microfinanciera EDESA.

He lives with his wife and 3 children:  Gustavo, Jason, and Estiven.  Don Mart\u00edn makes a living through agriculture, and his whole family helps him a little during planting and harvesting seasons.  The area where Mart\u00edn lives is called El Sauce de Santa Teresita de Turrialba.  It's a small rural community with 2,000 people.  They are dedicated to agriculture and dairy operations.  El Sauce has an irregular landscape, and much of the land is mantained as tropical forests.  The community has very picturesque landscapes which combine the tropical forest with lovely lakes, coffee plantations, and dairy farms.  El Sauce is approximately an hour and a half from Turrialba by bus, the closest city.  Several times a year, the road becomes impassable because of the rains that fall in the area.  This is without a doubt one of the biggest challenges for the community.  When there isn't any work, the people choose to look for jobs in Turrialba or on banana farms located in the Atlantic region of Costa Rica.\r\n\r\nCurrently the prices of coffee and milk have improved, so the neighbors are looking to invest in projects in their area.  Mart\u00edn has 1.2 hectares, on which he plants different crops like corn, beans, plantains, and coffee.  He has been dedicated to agriculture for 27 years.  During this time, he has had seasons that have gone very well and others when he has had to battle problems such as bad prices or natual phenomenons that damage his crops.  He obtained his land through a small loan.  Previously he had to rent land to sow his crops.\r\n\r\nDon Mart\u00edn is a client of the Association of Producers in El Sauce, a local organization that is a member of the microfinance institution EDESA.  Thanks to his connections with this organization, he has already obtained six microcredits, and all of them have been paid back satisfactorily.  The amounts of the loans have increased from 100,000 colones (180 USD) to 250,000 (450 USD) colones.  Currently don Mart\u00edn needs a loan of 500,000 (900 USD) colones to purchase seeds and fertilizer.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Tanya Harper, Kiva

N., 35, lives in the Bayanzurh district of Ulaanbaatar (the capital city of Mongolia) with her husband, 15-year-old son and 2-year-old daughter. In 2001, her family moved into their own ger (a traditional tent) for the first time. In 1999, with her husband, she opened up a small butcher shop in the Hantalst open-air market in Ulaanbaatar. Since its inception, her business has been quite successful, and she has been able to invest her profits into opening a second, wholesale meat stall.

She has 400 broiler chickens that she raises.  People come to her home and buy these chickens to take to the market to sell.    Ruth says that the market for broiler chickens is very large so it is able to support the large number of people who do it. Ruth buys her chickens from Uga-chick.  Uga-chick is a place where many Ugandan poultry farmers buy day-old chickens.  Although this practice does not differentiate her from other poultry farmers, she tries to be competitive in the market by spending extra money on food supplements.  The important thing with broiler chickens is that they are heavy.  If you just feed the chickens a lot of food, they will grow heavy, but not as heavy as if you spend a little extra for supplements.    Ruth has four older children who stay around her home.  She says that although they are now old (32, 30, 28, and 25), they still depend on her.  She also has 3 small children that she cares for.  Two of these children are from her late brother and one of them is a grandchild.  These children all need their daily needs met as well as school fees.    Ruth is requesting a loan of 250,000 USH.  This will allow her to buy the critical supplements as well as four bags of feed.

Having lacked the chance to go to school due to societal reasons, she tried many kinds of work to earn an income.  Seven years ago, she opted for commerce in various goods, buying and selling Wax <i>pagnes<\/i> (colorful West Africa cloth), kitchen utensils (\"Super\" basins, nickel basins, frying pans, etc.)  She is in high demand by her customers (composed essentially of women) for the quality of her goods.  Given that her shop is located on the roadside of one of the busiest arteries in town, and it has easy access, her business is booming.  And her customers are very satisfied.\r\n<p>\r\nWanting to do better in satisfying this ever-growing customer base, she decided to join the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso over six years ago.  After six solidarity loans (group loans) in a women's association in her area, she is now on her eighth individual loan.  All the preceding loans have been correctly repaid.  \r\n<p>\r\nShe intends to use this loan to buy five bolts of Wax <i>pagnes<\/i>, three sets of \"Super\" basins, four wristwatches, a dozen frying pans, five handbags, and ten dolls.   The merchandise is gotten in Dakar (Republic of Senegal) and is resold in her shop in Sikasso.  \r\n<p>\r\nShe envisions realizing a monthly profit of 150,000 francs CFA that will be used essentially to augment her working capital, to help cover family expenses, to pay the loan interest, and to invest the rest in her business.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":290078,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy various goods ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:27Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Assitan ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":200000,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":28571.43},{"due_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":28571.43},{"due_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":28571.43},{"due_date":"2009-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":28571.43},{"due_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":28571.43},{"due_date":"2009-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":28571.43},{"due_date":"2009-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":28571.42}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.14},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.14},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.14},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.14},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.14},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.14},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":57.14,"local_amount":28571.43,"processed_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:28:18Z","rounded_local_amount":28760.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033730,"comment":null},{"amount":57.14,"local_amount":28571.43,"processed_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:38:50Z","rounded_local_amount":28760.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44621097,"comment":null},{"amount":57.14,"local_amount":28571.43,"processed_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:21:29Z","rounded_local_amount":28760.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53020063,"comment":null},{"amount":57.14,"local_amount":28571.43,"processed_date":"2009-07-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:19:04Z","rounded_local_amount":28760.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242808,"comment":null},{"amount":57.14,"local_amount":28571.43,"processed_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:42:18Z","rounded_local_amount":28760.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678417,"comment":null},{"amount":57.14,"local_amount":28571.43,"processed_date":"2009-09-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T03:55:05Z","rounded_local_amount":28760.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87112456,"comment":null},{"amount":57.16,"local_amount":28571.42,"processed_date":"2009-10-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T07:07:59Z","rounded_local_amount":28760.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97028103,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-04-05T22:57:31Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T07:07:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":96085,"name":"Nilda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nilda L., 35, is a resident of Laredico, Salawagan, Quezon.To complement her husband's income, she engaged in a hog fattening  business and, at the same time, processes native delicacies such as puto (rice cakes), botse (baked goods with coconut filling), siopao and siakoy (sweetened bread formed into a braid).

He lives with his two wives and his children in Hamdallaye, a working-class neighborhood in the city of Sikasso (third administrative region of the Republic of Mali). Never having had the chance to attend school, he learned early on the business of selling fertilizers, pesticides, and insecticides. With 20 years of experience in this field, he enjoys a strong reputation and gets many orders. Looking for complementary financial resources in order to bolster his working capital, he decided to join Kiva's partner Soro Yiriwaso. He's seeking his first individual loan, which he intends to use to buy the following fertilizers : 4 sacks of urea, 4 sacks of \"cotton complex\" and 4 sacks of \"corn complex\". He gets his supplies from TOGUNA (a fertilizer factory) in Sikasso and sells his products in his shop at the new market of the M\u00e9dine quarter in Sikasso. He sells for cash or on credit, to a clientele comprising mostly farmers. With this loan, he foresees turning a monthly profit of XOF 60'000 (ca US$ 125), which he plans to to use to provide for his family expenses, to repay the loan, and to invest in his business.<br

She has 500 broiler chickens and 500 laying chickens.  Broiler chickens are raised for between 2 to 6 months before being sold for food.  Laying chickens can be kept for years, laying eggs that are then sold.  Margaret makes 5000 USH per broiler chicken and 5,000 per tray of eggs that she sells.  She is able to collect 10 trays of eggs each day for her laying chickens.  Margaret sells the majority of her broiler chickens wholesale to restaurants in her area.  She explains that the loans are critical to her success in securing these regular customers.  Margaret is able to keep her chickens for 6 months, unlike others who sell sooner, because she can finance her daily expenses during this time with her loans and her sales from her laying chickens.  The loans also allow her to purchase food in bulk, and that reduces the cost.  Margaret has 10 kids.  Four of these children are still in need of help with school fees; in addition, she is helping with seven grandchildren. She is requesting a loan of 900,000 USH to buy more feed for her 1,000 chickens.

She lives in a polygamous family with her husband, her co-wife, and their children in the Pelengana Nord district of S\u00e9gou (fourth administrative region of the Republic of Mali).  Not having attended school for societal reasons, she very early on started in commerce with her sister-in-law, who used to sell condiments at the grand marketplace of Pelenegana.  After several years with her, and rich with this experience, Ms. D. developed on her own for 15 years in the commerce of peanut butter and tamarind (an exotic fruit highly prized in Africa).  She frequently receives orders from Bamako or from certain civil servants in S\u00e9gou. \r\n<p>\r\nTo make her peanut butter, she first starts with threshing, and next she proceeds to shelling, winnowing, and roasting.  Finally she goes to grind the roasted nuts at the mill in order process them into paste.  After this phase, she puts the paste into 5-kg and 10-kg pails ready now for sale. \r\n<p>\r\nWith plans to augment her working capital, she turned to the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso, which she has had an association with for 4 years.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

Karimjon is in the livestock business. He breeds livestock, with which he provides sustenance for his humble home. Karimjon is married with 4 children. It is important to note that since he started his business, he has acquired an abundance of experience due to his great dedication and the knowledge he has acquired, breeding his animals. The reason why Karimjon looks for support to IMON International is that he needs to purchase livestock so he may sell it and in that way, continue with his arduous work with cattle in his sector.  <P>\r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Djamoliddin is 24 years old and he lives with his parents. Djamoliddin  has been a farmer since he was very young. He plants potatoes and other vegetables. Djamoliddin alternates the crops so that while one is growing the other is ready to be cleaned and prepared, until finally be begins to plant potatoes again. Growing potatoes is very profitable because there are certain seasons when prices are higher and farmers have the opportunity to increase their capital. <P>\r\n\r\nCurrently, Djamoliddin needs funds for growing his crop and for that reason he has applied to IMON International with the request for a 700 USD loan. He will spend this loan for buying potato seeds and fertilizer. This will be his first loan with IMON International, and his evaluation shows he is qualified to receive the loan.  <P>\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.
