It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Recently, Th\u00fay successfully repaid a previous loan in the amount of 8,288,000 VND from SEDA.  That prior loan was used to purchase additional inventory and for working capital purposes.  She is now requesting another loan, this time in the amount of 5,152,000 VND, which will be used to invest in expanding her business.  Notably, this loan would be the fourth loan taken out by Th\u00fay from SEDA.  Th\u00fay plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business as a result of the loan to pay her children's tuition fees. <p>\r\n\r\nThe following is a brief summary of the other borrowers

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC, and communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

is a 27-year-old single woman.

They live in a ger, a traditional Mongolian nomadic tent. \r\n\r\nBattsetseg runs a garment and underwear retail business. Once a month she travels to China to buy her products at wholesale price and resells them to customers. We see that her business is improving dramatically in recent years. \r\n\r\nIn spring 2010, she started a building project for the family house. The house is half complete. The basement and walls are erected. This year, she is planning to complete the building project, but she lacks funding. Battsetseg is planning to build her house greener than ordinary houses. She wants to put foam insulation materials between the walls and roof, and also to install double glazed windows to make the house more insulated from the cold and wind.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC, and communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC, and communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Khurshed works hard to develop his business and make his business profitable. \r\n\r\nKhurshed is requesting a loan of 13,500 TJS to reconstruct and modernize his grocery store to increase turnover capital and purchase an assortment of goods for retail sale. Khurshed is planning to use the generated profit to buy a new vehicle and remodel his private house. \r\n\r\nKhurshed is a conscientious and focused manager of his resources and always plans his time and finances. In all his business dealings, he is guided by a sense of trust and goodwill towards others. We believe these qualities will help him repay his loan without any delinquencies.  \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes having been a key post along the Silk Road and having witnessed the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC, and communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

is 27 year-old Rugiatu, who is married and has one child aged two years. In 2007, Rugiatu established her food (Tea & Achekeh) business as a means of earning income for herself and her family.  Working 6 days a week and 10 hours a day, she earns about Le 600,000 every month.<p>\r\n\r\nRugiatu would like a loan of Le 3,000,000 to buy provisions such as milk, sugar, tea and garri (used to prepare Achekeh).

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He located his business at the city\u2019s public market.\r\n\r\nAlthough he sells his products on a cash basis, he also has a few loyal customers that he allows to buy on credit to sell the products door-to-door.  The wintry wave that Colombia has been experiencing, particularly the riverine municipalities, has made all these products more expensive.  Roque must pay in cash to supply his business and offer competitive pricing, which is why he is turning to Kiva credit.  \r\n\r\nThis is his tenth loan through the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation.  He plans to buy products in bulk, as they are part of his customers\u2019 regular daily diets.  With his previous loans through this organization, Roque has had many achievements.  He has managed a small amount of additional working capital; he has diversified his offerings from just fruits, to include vegetables and tubers; and, through his business, was able to obtain his own house and provide a higher education for his children.  Thus, he has exhausted all his resources.\r\n\r\nHis dreams are to continue growing his business and to distribute his products in greater quantities.  While he continues working to meet these goals he achieves a 28% profit margin, which he plans to make higher by putting forth all his effort.

She says, \"I like to keep my crops clean.\"  She says that this year the price of coffee is very good, so she predicts she will earn a good income.  Her main difficulty is the lack of working capital, so she also plants pineapple, where she invests a larger quantity of money, and it also requires more care.  In the future, she is thinking of purchasing a truck to transport their crops and sell them themselves without intermediaries so they can earn more money.  \r\n\r\nShe is a member of the community bank Los Progresistas, and this is her first loan with MFP.

A mother of 4 children, she became a widow 30 years ago when her husband Andr\u00e9s died. She now lives in her own house with her beloved son Henry in the town of Huayounioc. With a lot of efforts Marcelina was able to open a small caf\u00e9 in the town of Huayounioc, and with the help of her deceased husband she was able to fit it very well, little by little transforming it in a very well-known and popular place. The food she serves is very good, and for this reason her caf\u00e9 is attended by many customers. She sells coffee, panqueques (a sort of pancake maD. with flour) and drinks, which she sells mainly at night. Keeping her shop clean is what she loves the most about her job. She has been running this activity for 10 years and she thinks the most difficult part is to serve many people at the same time, as sometime she finds it hard to keep up with it. She also said she engages in breeding cows and small animals such as sheep, then selling their meat and milk. Every morning she goes to town to buy the manure they need, and being a good country woman she also engages in growing potatoes, maize and carrots on a small scale, as she has not so much time to dedicate to this because of her many activities. In the future she wishes to be able to save enough to lead a peaceful life in her old age. She is a member of the Banco Comunal \u201cProgreso Huayounioc\u201d (\u201cHuayounioc Progress\u201d Communal Bank), and this is the sixth loan she has requested to MFP.

With time she invested her strength and time to get ahead, when she was younger she worked in a pastry shop for 10 years selling bread, cakes and other products. That gave Celia enough time to raise money to buy her own plot of land where she grows vegetables that she sells wholesale in the capital. Later she was able have a small store in her home and decided to look for a partner to be able to sow her land and have more time to work on her other activities. She put the plot of land and manure while her partner put in the seeds and labor for the harvest. As a hardworking and clever woman she was able to invest all of her profits to build a home in the city of Chanchamayo (in the central jungle of Peru) where she rents rooms to different people collecting rent each month.

is a musical artist manager and record producer who started the record label \"Black Music Cartel\" in 2010 as a vehicle for launching his son\u2019s music career. Kenneth has been around the music industry all of his life, having grown up with a father who was a professional musician and who toured with the likes of Chaka Kahn and the Doobie Brothers. As a father of three musically gifted sons, Kenneth and his wife always encouraged their children to develop their musical abilities and had them singing in their church choir from an early age.\r\n\r\nKenneth is a US Navy veteran with a B.S. in Accounting and a Masters in Business Administration. While a student in college, Kenneth worked as an event coordinator for a band, helping plan and schedule performances with music venues. In the years since Kenneth graduated from college, he has worked off-and-on with artists as a hobby and part-time job. When Kenneth\u2019s oldest son, Aries, began pursuing a career as a professional musician, Kenneth decided to invest in his son\u2019s future. He is representing Aries as his manager and helping him record his debut album.  \r\n\r\nThis loan helps Kenneth finance Aries\u2019 first music video and the recording of the final four tracks of his debut nine-track album. Kenneth and Aries will soon be attending an important music conference, and it is critical for them to have the album and video completed by that time. The conference will be an excellent networking opportunity where they will be able to develop relationships with key figures in the music industry, and they need to have their material ready to present.  \r\n\r\nWhile Kenneth builds his business and Aries\u2019 career, he continues to work full-time with a security team contracted to protect an Exxon-Mobil facility. Until taking this loan, Kenneth had been paying for all of Black Music Cartel\u2019s expenses with his savings. Kenneth says that he works with his wife in carefully planning all business expenses and that they work hard to maximize the effect of their budget. Leading up to the release of Aries\u2019 first album, they have marketed exclusively through the internet, making full use of Twitter, Facebook and YouTube.\r\n\r\nHere is a link to a video of Aries performing at a talent show that he participated in while serving as a US Army reservist in Haiti.

She sells such items as canned goods, snack foods, beverages, shampoo, soap, and biscuits in the local community. Ruby has been engaged in her business for over four years and earns approximately 11,000 PHP a month from these activities. Ruby and her husband have two school-aged children.  \r\n\r\nIn 2010, Ruby joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services. She wanted to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Ruby has successfully repaid her most recent previous loan of 7,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional inventory and was employed as working capital. Ruby is now requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional canned goods and snack food items. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Ruby from HSPFI.

Through the loan, he will buy milk in larger quantity which should enable him to serve more clients and earn better profits. \r\n\r\nHe has been doing this business for the past 10 years and Shah Jahan hopes that he will make good use of the loan to get the desired results from his business.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1113.15,"image":{"id":774143,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Milk Sales","sector":"Food","use":"To buy milk for milk & yogurt selling business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PK","country":"Pakistan","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"30 70","type":"point"}},"partner_id":60,"posted_date":"2011-05-23T17:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shah Jahan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kosar Bibi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Suraiya Parveen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kosar Kalsoom","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sumera Begum","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Naziran","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PKR","disbursal_amount":115000,"loan_amount":1350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":10536},{"due_date":"2011-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":10536},{"due_date":"2011-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":10536},{"due_date":"2011-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":10536},{"due_date":"2011-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":10536},{"due_date":"2011-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":10536},{"due_date":"2011-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":10536},{"due_date":"2012-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":10536},{"due_date":"2012-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":10536},{"due_date":"2012-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":10536},{"due_date":"2012-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":9640}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.68},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.69},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.68},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.68},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":123.69},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":123.68},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":123.68},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":123.69},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.68},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.68},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":123.68,"local_amount":10536,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:34:11Z","rounded_local_amount":10569.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216452957,"comment":null},{"amount":123.69,"local_amount":10536,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:19:24Z","rounded_local_amount":10569.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221616912,"comment":null},{"amount":123.68,"local_amount":10536,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:27:33Z","rounded_local_amount":10569.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":226986041,"comment":null},{"amount":123.68,"local_amount":10536,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:21:57Z","rounded_local_amount":10569.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232744886,"comment":null},{"amount":123.69,"local_amount":10536,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:24:32Z","rounded_local_amount":10569.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238549371,"comment":null},{"amount":123.68,"local_amount":10536,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:17:56Z","rounded_local_amount":10569.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244508168,"comment":null},{"amount":123.68,"local_amount":10536,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:21:43Z","rounded_local_amount":10569.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250715844,"comment":null},{"amount":123.69,"local_amount":10536,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:32:43Z","rounded_local_amount":10569.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257118745,"comment":null},{"amount":123.68,"local_amount":10536,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:33:18Z","rounded_local_amount":10569.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263243781,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-05-24T22:35:14Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":300514,"name":"Melca","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Melca lives in the village of Guanzon Tuto St., Gingoog City.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous, leaving only 7 percent arable land. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous, leaving only 7 percent arable land. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
