He has been in business for 9 years. Mirzorahmat is single and has high school education. After his father died, as the oldest son, Mirzorahmat took over responsibility for his mother, who taught him his trade. Mirzorahmat used to take orders at home. Gradually, as he acquired many clients, Mirzorahmat purchased a trading spot at a market. In 2005, when Mirzorahmat received his first loan from MicroInvest, his business assets were worth $200. At that time, he loaned the food ingredients from his suppliers. Gradually, as he invested his loan funds, Mirzorahmat began to pay upfront to his suppliers. He also purchased vats to marinate cucumbers and tomatoes. Today, the value of Mirzorahmat\u2019s business increased to $1000. In the future, he plans to purchase wholesale the food ingredients for canning. P.S.

Now, while her husband is away working as a seasonal laborer in the neighboring countries, Hamira is the one responsible for providing for her family and raising her children. While taking care of her daughters, Hamira managed to expand her business. She joined MicroInvest in 2003 and took the first loan of $90.

Velasco is 55 and has lived through some pretty rough times. During the violent years of the 1980\u2019s civil war in Guatemala her house was burned to the ground and her father-in-law was tortured and killed. It still near enough that it brings tears to her eyes when she discusses the subject. But right now she\u2019s making do with her several businesses: she raises chickens and pigs, weaves the traditional Mayan top called a huipil, and even has a little tiny store that carries sugar, soap, and other such daily necessities.  She\u2019ll use this loan to increase her animal production, adding 15 chickens and 3 pigs. The chickens will be half for laying eggs and half for later sale for meat.  Nicolasa can make about US$4.00\/week of profit on her eggs, a significant boost.<p>Nicolasa and her husband have 9 children, most grown, but with two daughters (13 and 16) still at home. Their 16-year-old is deaf, a significant challenge in a culture with no deaf-specific education. Most of the kids have received at least an elementary education. Nicolasa never did get much education, despite her dad\u2019s best efforts. He would take her to school, but she would hide and not go in. She did get just enough to be able to read and sign her name.<p>Nicolasa\u2019s husband commutes every day to Guatemala City, where he works in a flower company.

Mavlyuda took her first loan for $150 from MicroInvest in 2003. Back then, she bought and sold flour wholesale. After being very responsible with her loans and using them wisely, she was able to open a retail location where she now sells stuffed pastries. Her daughter helps with flour sales.

In their loan application, the group described their business as follows:<p>\r\n\r\n\u201cIn spite of the countless social difficulties that arise from the disastrous economic situation, the village of Diourbel has kept alive its ancient tradition of producing tourgui ndiareme textiles.  Although the women of Diourbel have been severely affected by the economic hardship, they jealously guard the secrets of weaving these small wrap outfits, which are highly prized by both locals and outsiders.  With the recent acceleration in migration out of rural areas, women occupy a strategic position in the area of clothing production and other crafts.  These products are easily marketed thanks to the numerous loumas (weekly markets) and Diourbel's proximity to the holy city of Touba, which attracts enormous crowds in its seasonal pilgrimages.  This has been a boon to the women who supplement their families' incomes with local trading activities.  In order to strengthen these activities, the members of our group always need to augment their available stock so that they can ensure continuous and diversified production.  Since many women compete in this market, the members of our group also plan to introduce the sale of finished products purchased in other loumas.\u201d <p>\r\n\r\nBackground\r\n<p>\r\nSenegal is one of the world\u2019s poorest countries, yet its solid democratic tradition and highly developed associational life distinguish it from other countries in its income group. Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, known as tontines. Commonly organized by groups of twenty to thirty housewives who live in the same village, the tontines provide poor women throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these associations are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income.

But in addition, the fault of material and financial means as well as the weakness of technical support mean that livestock activity is limited to just a few traditional herders.

In their loan application, the group described their business as follows:\r\n<p>\r\n\u201cThe town of Gandiol has about 13,968 inhabitants.  The principal economic activities of the area are fishing, horticulture, herding, and salt production.  But the recent degredation of the climate has done damage to the entire community.  And this is reflected in the weak development of the local markets.  One thus notes the existence of temporary markets which are insufficient to meet local demand.\r\n<p>\r\nIn order to address this insufficiency, the members of the Femmes de Gandiol group hope to develop the local market by creating a system of acquisition and commercialization of diverse products, by giving our members the chance to use loans to develop local trade.\r\n<p>\r\nOur business will consist of marketing basic household foodstuffs: vegetables, fruits, fresh fish, and other foods used in daily meals.  We will buy these goods at a lower cost in the markets of the nearby towns of Potou and St. Louis, and resell then in our village.\u201d \r\n<p>\r\nBackground\r\n<p>\r\nSenegal is one of the world\u2019s poorest countries, yet its solid democratic tradition and highly developed associational life distinguish it from other countries in its income group. Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, known as tontines. Commonly organized by groups of twenty to thirty housewives who live in the same village, the tontines provide poor women throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these associations are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional tontines from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities. The SEM Fund works to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance.\r\n<p><b> Business description translated from French by Senegal Ecovillage Microfinance Fund. <\/b>\r\n<p>\r\n\u00abLa population de Gandiol s\u2019estime \u00e0 environ 13.968 habitants.\r\nLes principales activit\u00e9s \u00e9conomiques qui sont men\u00e9es dans la zone sont : la p\u00eache, le mara\u00eechage, l\u2019\u00e9levage, et l\u2019extraction du sel.\r\nCependant du fait de la p\u00e9joration climatique et des ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes anthropique, le niveau de d\u00e9gradation et de d\u00e9sorganisation est ressentis par sa communaut\u00e9 enti\u00e8re.

Q., 31, sells new clothes by either walking in the streets or going house to house knocking on doors. She goes to Guatemala City or as they call it here \u201cGuate\u201d to buy new clothes to sell. With this loan she will be able to restock her selection, which is very low because she has sold out of everything. The first loan was so successful in starting her new business that she's pleased to be moving on to a second loan.<p>She and the other members of her group just finished paying off their first 6 month loan. They all paid up in full and on time, something to be proud of and not something all groups are able to achieve. <p>She is married and has two children, both in school. When asked how much schooling she has had she was shy to admit that she had only finished the sixth grade. But she knows how important school is. Her dream is to continue with her own schooling to become a nurse and help her husband finish schooling as an electronics repairman in radios and televisions.

Y. Abrego Quisgue, 21, started selling food at the local school six months ago with her first loan from Friendship Bridge. She sells tostadas, ice cream, chips, juices, hot dogs and drinks. She also makes and sells tortillas, the major staple in the everyday diet of the people of Guatemala. Guatemalans don't prefer the machine-made type but rather the ones that are made by hand by patting freshly milled corn dough and cooking them to perfection on a hot metal plate. She makes about 65 tortillas a day and sells them for about US$0.12 for 6 hand-made tortillas. Making the tortillas has been challenging for her lately because several months ago she fell at a circus and badly broke her arm and lost almost all movement of her hand. The break is evident from the 6 inch scar on her upper arm. Making tortillas can sometimes be very painful. But on the worst days she is happy to be working with a partner who helps her get through the day. <p>Ana is single and lives with her mom and her 5 other brothers and sisters. Her dreams are still developing and as of now she wants to make money to save for her.future.\r\n<p>Written by Nancy Lewis and Randy Fay, Kiva

Avila, 20, does what she can do to help out her family. She works along with her mother, sisters and brothers to make ends meet. For the past 20 years the whole family has been making masks and papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9's for the special festivals in the area. (The picture shows the whole family with some of their masks. Dora is the second from the left in the red shirt.) She took out her first loan to buy materials to make more papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 characters and also to stock  the little school supply store she has in front of her house. Before she opened the store the children in the neighborhood had to cross the extremely dangerous Pan-American highway to buy school supplies. Now they can stay safe and visit little store.<p>With this loan, Dora will expand her business into making tortillas. She will buy firewood for cooking, and corn and lime to make the tortillas twice a day.<p>Dora graduated from high school by working during the day and attending school at night. She wants to continue with schooling to become the equivalent of a registered nurse, but she does not have the money to buy the required equipment and pay the US$30 a month she would need to finish the two years of schooling.<p> The members of her tightly knit family all pitch in either to work their corn fields (a two hour walk away) or make masks or to make tortillas. Dora's father is seriously ill and can't work so it is even more important for all the others to pull their load. Dora does not hesitate to work to help support the family even if it means she may not be able to realize her own dreams.<p>Written by Nancy Lewis and Randy Fay, Kiva

B. is 26 years old, is married and has three children. He has a high-school education. He sells household goods. He owns and raises cattle with the help of his wife. He became a client of MicroInvest in 2005. Back then he had $400 in assets and had to borrow money from illegal creditors in order to achieve a higher turnover. Gradually, over the course of  2 years during which he systematically borrowed money, he became a knowledgeable and successful client. He was able to open another sales outlet and can now go buy goods at wholesale prices. Currently his assets amount to $800, not counting the cattle that he raises at home.

The loan allowed him to increase turnover of his goods. Previously he had to by goods from local suppliers and pay for them in several installments with high mark-ups.

and Mrs. Opoki, aged 57 and 48 years respectively, are a couple that is working closely together to make a better future for themselves and their children.\r\n\r\nThey have eight children, three of whom are still going to school. Mr. Opoki formally working as a banking assistant but lost his job following the closure of the Peoples owned Uganda Commercial Bank following its privatization around 2001.\r\n\r\nWith no formal work, the Opokis had to find ways of raising funds to cater for their basic needs as well as educating their children. Using savings from the former employment, he bought a piece of land. Three years ago the couple began a fish business, however the business has been low because they don\u2019t have a freezer to preserve the fish.\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Opoki are planning to borrow $600 to purchase a freezer.

Prisciliana lives with her daughter in a rented house. Her husband emigrated to Argentina a couple of years ago to look for better work opportunities, and he is currently working as a cook in a very busy restaurant in Buenos Aires.<p>Prisciliana has been working since she was very young. She wasn't able to finish her studies because she comes from a very humble family and her parents and siblings were working to support the family. Her mother was a weaver, like many of the women in the city of Carapegua. She taught Prisciliana the techniques of the craft.<p>At the age of 20, Prisciliana went to work in the capital as domestic help. After saving for several years she returned to her native city to open her own textile shop. She bought a loom, which she uses to make woven blankets, bedspreads and cotton hammocks.  Thanks to her effort and the good work  she produces, she now provides woven products to the owners of several stores in the capital, who come to her city exclusively to buy her products. <p>Prisciliana's dream is to be able to build her own house where she would live with her daughter and her husband, who sends her money from Argentina monthly. She says that once they finish the construction her husband will come back to Paraguay to be reunited with the family that misses him very much. <p>Prisciliana is applying for a loan of $800, the last of the money her family needs to begin building their home.<p><p><b>Translated from Spanish by Erin Corcoran, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>Prisciliana P. tiene 35 a\u00f1os de edad, ella est\u00e1  casada y tiene una hija de 5 a\u00f1os.

She sews men's and women's traditional national gowns. The demand is high and peaks especially during national Muslim holidays, during which it is customary to give such gowns to the elderly. Channat buys material from the wholesales market, sews the gowns, and then her sister, who sells leather jackets on the market, helps her sell them. The business is profitable and allows Channat to take good care of her family. The loan that she received from MicroInvest was a welcome boost to her business.

Mostly she sells cosmetics for EBEL and YAMBEL and other brands representing all price points.  This is her third loan from Fundacion Agrocapital.  Her previous loans--for $300 and $650, respectively--were repaid promptly.  <p> <b> Translated by a Kiva volunteer.  <\/b> <p>\r\n\r\nMaria Laura es una persona de 26 a\u00f1os de edad que trabaja s\u00f3la para sustentar a su familia, es mam\u00e1 soltera y vive en la casa de su t\u00eda. Es muy apreciada por las pesonas que la conocen por la gran calidad humana que posee.\r\nMaria Laura cuenta con una experiencia de m\u00e1s de tres a\u00f1os en el negocio de venta de cosm\u00e9ticos en general y art\u00edculos de cuero (carteras, billeteras, etc.). Ella no cuenta con un puesto fijo por lo que ofrece estos productos deambulando por las calles de la ciudad de Santa Cruz y en las zonas aleda\u00f1as.\r\nMaria Laura minimiza el riesgo de la competencia asegurando a su clientela, para l@s que abastece de manera consecutiva todos sus productos y cuando le solicitan cosm\u00e9ticos de otras marcas, ella se sirve de intermediaria con sus amistades para poder satisfacer a sus clientes.\r\nEn su mayor\u00eda trabaja con productos de las l\u00edneas de EBEL, YAMBAL, etc., cosm\u00e9ticos que son de variados precios, lo que le permite proveer de los mismos a diferentes estratos del mercado. \r\nEste es el tercer pr\u00e9stamo que la cliente saco en nuestra instituci\u00f3n, beneficiandose anteriormente con $us. 300.- y $us. 650.-, en ambos casos demostr\u00f3 tener un buen comportamiento ya que sus pagos fueron

She has an excellent track record with microfinance, having taken out nine previous loans all of which she repaid promptly.  <p> <b> Translated by a Kiva volunteer. <\/b> <p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAngela tiene 43 a\u00f1os de edad, su familia est\u00e1 compuesta por 6 personas, mismas que radican en Minero desde hace bastante tiempo atr\u00e1s. El esposo de Angela trabaja como transportista dependiente de \"La Chane\" Unagro, juntos velan por la educaci\u00f3n y salud de sus 5 hijos, cuatro de los cuales asisten actualmente al colegio, y la Hija mayor que tiene 19 a\u00f1os de edad se encuentra en tramites para entrar a la Universidad estatal, mientras ayuda a su mam\u00e1 en el restaurante.\r\nActualmente alquila uno de los locales m\u00e1s conocidos de Minero, donde cuenta con una buena ubicaci\u00f3n, en este lugar ella ofrece servicios de Bar-Restaurante atendiendo a sus clientes con comida, bebida y juegos de billar. Ella tiene bastante experiencia en el negocio ya que trabaja en el mismo desde hace un tiempo atras, comenz\u00f3 vendiendo comida en su domicilio particular.\r\nAngela hace frente a la competencia del sector al ampliar los servicios que ofrece en su Bar-Restaurante, es decir en un mismo lugar los clientes pueden satisfacer sus necesidades de comida y de entretenimiento. Es gracias a su esfuerzo que el restaurante lleg\u00f3 a crecer, por lo que ahora requiere de capital para poder invertir en la compra de mesas, sillas, un freezer, etc.\r\nAngela tiene excelentes

With this business she educated her four children, who today are independent. Her daughter invited her to participate in the B.C. \"Las Palmeras,\" which she accepted with a great deal of fear because she had no experience with credit, and solicited her first loan of 300 Sol (approximately $95) with which she purchased small pigs to raise and then sell. She was very good in the business of raising and selling pigs, but today she has decided to stick with cattle, ducks, and turkeys because pigs are a lot of work.

She owns a store on the outskirts of the town where she sells palm oil.   <P>Yeabu's husband rents a motorbike to provide services for passengers and shares the profit with the motorbike owner.  His income is insufficient to support their family. Her previous loan allowed Yeabu to help take care of her family, especially paying school fees and medical bills.   <P>Yeabu would like to expand her business to generate more income so that she and her husband can purchase a motorbike to use for their family business.  This loan of $175 will go to purchase 50 more gallons of palm oil and with time will enable Yeabu to earn a good profit ."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":57394,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase additional palm oil to sell in her shop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Magburaka, Tonkolili","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"8.5 -11.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2007-08-29T17:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yeabu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-09-12T20:10:31Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":175,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":21.88},{"due_date":"2007-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":21.88},{"due_date":"2007-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":21.88},{"due_date":"2008-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":21.88},{"due_date":"2008-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":21.88},{"due_date":"2008-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":21.88},{"due_date":"2008-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":21.88},{"due_date":"2008-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":21.84}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":21.88},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":21.88},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":21.88},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":21.88},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":21.88},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":21.88},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":21.88},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":21.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":22,"local_amount":22,"processed_date":"2007-10-12T09:24:59Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-12T09:06:41Z","rounded_local_amount":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":66500,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":22,"local_amount":22,"processed_date":"2007-11-12T10:27:58Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-12T09:06:41Z","rounded_local_amount":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":80500,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":22,"local_amount":22,"processed_date":"2007-12-12T10:30:04Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-12T09:06:41Z","rounded_local_amount":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":95948,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":22,"local_amount":22,"processed_date":"2008-01-12T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-12T09:06:41Z","rounded_local_amount":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":114400,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":22,"local_amount":22,"processed_date":"2008-02-12T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-12T09:06:41Z","rounded_local_amount":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":133934,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":22,"local_amount":22,"processed_date":"2008-03-12T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-12T09:06:41Z","rounded_local_amount":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":156283,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":22,"local_amount":22,"processed_date":"2008-04-12T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-12T09:06:41Z","rounded_local_amount":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":180639,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":21,"local_amount":21,"processed_date":"2008-05-12T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-12T09:06:41Z","rounded_local_amount":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":208222,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2007-08-29T20:10:31Z","paid_date":"2008-05-12T09:06:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":17036,"name":"Lidya","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Lidia V.

They also travel to other cities carrying baskets filled with pan de miel to sell in San Lorenzo and Asuncion, which are both an hour's bus ride away. <p>\r\n\r\nIt takes Anibal and his wife four hours each day to complete baking the pan de miel. Anibal has a motorcycle that he uses to sell his pan de miel, and also to deliver the pan de miel to the houses of the vendors that work for him. They usually sell about 300 each day.\r\n<p>\r\nAnibal was working at a factory three years ago, but was left unemployed after it closed down. His brother-in-law, who also produces pan de miel, showed him how to start his own pan de miel business. Now Anibal and his wife bake everyday using the brick oven they built outside their house. Anibal and his wife are hard workers who take advantage of every opportunity to increase their income. Aside from the pan de miel business, they also own a pig and plan sell in within a couple of months after it gets bigger. With this Kiva loan, Anibal will buy more ingredients to make pan de miel, which includes flour, oil, honey, sugar, milk and eggs."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":57446,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase flour, oil, honey, sugar, milk, and eggs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PY","country":"Paraguay","town":"Ita","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-25.483333 -57.35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":58,"posted_date":"2007-08-31T08:25:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anibal","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-09-15T00:46:40Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":400,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":66.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2007-10-02T09:26:54Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T17:50:59Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":61873,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2007-11-02T10:28:18Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T17:50:59Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":75348,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2007-12-02T10:28:06Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T17:50:59Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":90118,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2008-01-02T10:20:26Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T17:50:59Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":106588,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":132,"local_amount":132,"processed_date":"2008-01-03T17:50:59Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T17:50:59Z","rounded_local_amount":132,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":107644,"comment":"Prepayment"}],"funded_date":"2007-09-01T00:46:40Z","paid_date":"2008-01-03T17:50:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":17055,"name":"Antonio","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Antonio G., 38, is a hard worker and has various sources of income.
