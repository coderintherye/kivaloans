Along with her hairdressing services, she sells hair extensions, pomades, shampoos, conditioners, and rechargeable telephone cards. She also has a refrigerator which means she can sell ice and  drinks from SOBEBRA, a company that brews beer. Her clientele is composed of people from her neighborhood and its surroundings. \r\n\r\nShe buys the supplies for her salon as well as the items she sells at Tokpa, the largest market in B\u00e9nin. In order to better satisfy her clients, she decided to grow her working capital. This is the reason why she has asked for and been granted a small loan from FINADEV. The supplemental income generated from this small loan will allow her to improve day-to-day living conditions for her family, for example, the general comfort of her home. \r\n\r\nIn future, she would like to sell wholesale and also to have her very own home to live in.

Throughout her life she has had to work at whatever was possible that would produce income in exchange.  Not having finished secondary school and believing, like in the old days, that the more children one had the greater ability to cultivate the fields and earn more money to eat and have health, those priorities led her not to plan her family.  With no other alternative now, she must split herself up to work from sun to sun.\r\n\r\nShe works selling dry goods (maize, dehydrated potato, L. beans, grains, Quinoa, broad beans, pallares beans).  She also sells small farm animals (guinea pigs and barnyard fowl).  She sells in the Combapata market.  In addition, when suppliers bring coca leaves from the Peruvian jungle in small amounts she takes them to her stand in the market to sell too.  Coca leaf is considered to be a sacred plant and Incas grew it in antiquity.  It\u2019s currently part of our cultures and it\u2019s known only for its properties, not as a drug.  In Andean society this leaf is too sacred to desecrate using it for evil like some humans do against other humans. With what her sales of products and small animals produce she educates and feeds her minor children.\r\n\r\nShe is asking for a loan to buy small farm animals and a few dry goods that she does not grow herself.\r\n\r\nThe other group members alternate their activities with retail sales.

chose a challenging time to start up his business, \u2018Yes V Can\u2019: \u201cI registered the company at City Hall on a rainy Friday the 13th in February of 2009,\u201d he describes. \r\n\r\nDespite his launching the business at the height of the recession, Yes V Can is growing. Mili explains that an old saying \u2013 \u201cGreatness requires the taking of risks. That is why so few ever achieve it,\u201d \u2013 inspires him to take on the challenges of owning a small business. Yes V Can provides copying, printing, binding, and other services for large construction projects, and Mili\u2019s signs - like those used to indicate projects that have received American Recovery Reinvestment Act funding - can be seen around the San Francisco Bay Area.\r\n\r\nMili prides himself on thinking outside the box to keep prices low. Recently, he successfully out-bid a large corporation for a banner project in San Francisco\u2019s Bayview neighborhood, where his shop is located. While the corporation sought to lower prices by purchasing metal brackets made in China, Mili employed an acquaintance to turn out the brackets locally. Mili kept the job local, and his fixtures were cheaper and stronger. \r\n\r\nLooking forward, Mili would like to be a \u2018one-stop shop\u2019 for all construction companies and walk-in customers who need his services. \u201cFinding customers and building trust is the difficult part,\u201d he explains. \u201cOnce I find them, I want to progress through the project with the customer.\u201d \r\n\r\nWhen Mili started Yes V Can he needed a large format printer, but without an established credit history he was unable to qualify for a loan from his bank or leasing company. Mili rented the machine from a competitor but was charged a crippling fee that was 400% above market rate. Fortunately, he was recently presented with the chance to buy his own machine and came to his local MFI, Opportunity Fund, for financing. \r\n\r\n\u201cI was in a quandary over what to do. Then I heard about Opportunity Fund, and within 2 weeks I was approved for a loan. This is a really good thing.\u201d A $5,000 loan will cover the cost of two used printers, which will allow him to take on more jobs, be more cost-effective, and grow his business. In the near future, he plans to hire an employee to help manage his increasing workload. \r\n\r\nUltimately, Mili\u2019s goal is to help and hire from his community. \u201cIt\u2019s through the community that I\u2019ve been able to do this so far \u2013 showing gratitude and giving back is very important. That\u2019s how I was raised by my parents, and I want to live by their example so my children will do the same when it is time for them to face the world!\u201d

They are located in the Mexican state of Puebla.  The group is made up of 9 members.\r\n\r\nMatilde Melina H. R. is 33 years old, studied until high school, and is a bread maker.  In total, she has 2 children: one girl and one boy.  Matilde has been making bread for 6 years.  She is requesting a loan to buy ingredients so that she can accommodate all of her customers' orders.  Her neighbors and customers say that they are very pleased to buy bread from her and that it is very tasty.  They love her rolls, which is what she sells the most of.  Customers prefer her business due to its cleanliness and for the good flavor of her breads.  Matilde's business is at the entrance to the community and for this reason, she says her sales are improving consistently.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, as she requests this loan, Matilde feels happy.  She wants this loan to buy necessary items like sugar, flour, egg, flavorings, and other ingredients, in order to fill the orders she has so far for the upcoming holidays of Las Posadas [a nine-day celebration leading up to Christmas], Christmas Eve, and Christmas.  She has also promised orders already for the Epiphany celebration in January.\r\n\r\nMatilde hopes to give her children a life and education of dignity, as she does not have the support of their father, who abandoned them 10 years ago.  She hopes to continue moving forward like she has so far, and to continue to be proud and a good example for her children.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2975,"image":{"id":656170,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","use":"to buy

This time, for her 25th loan, she is borrowing PHP 19,000, which she intends to use to buy more stocks of goods to sell so that she can continue to save up for the future needs of her family.  Nelly T. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

Arnold has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used as additional working capital. Arnold is requesting a new loan of 11000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional computer sets. This loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by Arnold from HSPFI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand his business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

M. is 57-years old, married and supports her family by operating 2 business ventures:  a General Store and a  Carinderia (eatery) business. She lives in  Brgy. Prosperidad, San Carlos City, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2000 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her General Store and Carinderia (eatery) business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 6,000. Aurelia is now borrowing PHP 25,000 so that she can continue to purchase more stock to sell.   This will be her 16th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 25,000, which she paid off well within its term was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Aurelia aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  a general store and a food vending business. Carmelita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 13 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Carmelita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 17,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of approximately $118, raising the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 14th cycle loan, she is borrowing 19,000 PHP, with which she intends to buy stock for the general store so that she can continue to save up for the future expansion of her business. Carmelita T. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \t\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon -- a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work. \r\n\r\nHelp NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by clicking the link to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/team\/nwtf_philippines\">NWTF Kiva lending team<\/a> on

She earns her living by operating three business ventures: a sari-sari (general) store, a cashew brittle business and a banana chips business. Her husband Ronaldo, who is 45 years old, works as a government employee to earn his living. They have one child who is five years old. \r\n\r\nRowena joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2006 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 7 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, she has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 14,500 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of approximately $288, raising the family's standard of living. \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 8th loan, she is borrowing 19,500 PHP, which she intends to use as additional capital for buying cashew nuts and more stock for the general store so that she can continue to save up for the future. Rowena I. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon -- a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work. \r\n\r\nHelp NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by clicking the link to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/team\/nwtf_philippines\">NWTF Kiva lending team<\/a> on

She is 36 years old, married and has 2 school-age children. To make a living, Venancia owns & operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. The main source of income for the business comes from buying and selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap, toothpaste, canned goods & snack foods in the local community. Venancia has been engaged in her business for over 2 years and earns approximately 8000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Venancia joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Venancia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory & working capital. Venancia is requesting a new loan of 8000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products like snack foods & biscuits. This loan will be Venancia's 2nd loan from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

M. is a married woman who lives in Prk Kangkasa, Brg. Jolomaynon, Dalaguete, Cebu. She earns her living by operating a vegetable vending business. Her husband Alberto Bombarda, who is 29 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have 2 children who are 2 months and 2 years old respectively. <p>\r\n\r\nM. joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2009 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 3 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, M. has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4,950, thus uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 4th loan, she is borrowing PHP 13,000 which she intends to use as funds for her business operations so she can continue to save up for her children's future. M. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

I. is a 44-year old married woman who supports her family by operating a fishing\/fish-vending business. She lives in Brgy. Coro, Dalaguete, Cebu. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2004 and has improved her living conditions through her own efforts and with the help of her loans from NWTF. By working hard in her business, Myrna is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of 11,200 PHP. \r\n\r\nMyrna is now borrowing 29,000 PHP so that she can purchase fishing gear and equipment. This will be her 13th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her last loan of 29,000 PHP, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom. Myrna aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well being by following the Dungganon way.\r\n\r\n About NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

M. is from the village of Digkilaan, Iligan City. She is 56 years old, married, and has two adult children. To make a living, Anita owns and operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap, canned goods, instant noodles, and toothpaste in the local community. Anita has been engaged in her business for over 35 years and earns approximately 9,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Anita joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Anita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from HSPFI, which was used to to purchase additional inventory and acquire working capital. Anita is requesting a new loan of 11,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products such as beverages and breads. This loan will be Anita's third loan from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":656448,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

F. is from the village of Santa Felomena, Iligan City. She is 36 years old. Stella is married and has one school-aged child. To make a living, Stella owns & operates a business venture in the food sector butchering and selling meat in the market. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from butchering & selling pork in the market. Stella has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 6000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Stella joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Stella has successfully repaid a previous loan of 9000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional pigs to be butchered. Stella is requesting a new loan of 9000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business, for example in making and selling home-made sausage. This will be the 4th loan taken out by Stella from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is an accredited partner of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and reaches out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

Sillom, Bantayan, Cebu City. She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures:  pig fattening and fishing. Her husband, Gualberto Bawiin, who is 46 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living.  He also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have 7 children who are a few days old to 21 years old. \r\n\r\nMarilyn joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 18 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Marilyn has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 20,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 19th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 25,000 which she intends to use to fund her business operations so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children and for their family's needs. \r\n\r\nMarilyn B. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

L. is a married woman who lives in Brgy. Kaungkod, Madredijos, Cebu. She earns her living by operating two business ventures: pig fattening and a frozen foods business. Her husband, Bernardo L., who is 50 years old, works as a tricycle driver to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's businesses. They have four children aged between 15 and 26. \r\n<br>Nida joined Kiva partner, NWTF-Project Dungganon, in 2000 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past ten loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Nida has been gradually lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 22,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 3,000 PHP, raising the family's standard of living. This time, for her 11th loan, she is borrowing 29,000 PHP, which she intends to use to purchase feed and other supplies for her piggery.

D. is a married woman who lives in Cordova, Brgy. Cogon, Lapu-Lapu City, Cebu. She earns her living by operating a business venture: a vegetable vending  business.  Her husband Wensislao D., who is 47 years old, helps his wife in running the business. They have 5 children who are 7 to 23 years old. \r\n\r\nLuciana joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2009 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 2 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Luciana has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 6,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 20,000, thus  uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 3rd cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 11,000 which she intends to use as additional capital for her business so that she can continue to save up for the future and expand her business.  Luciana D. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

Her husband works hard all day catching fish in the ocean, but he brings home a very small amount of money because the ones who own the fishing equipment get a larger amount, and they will only give him a small percent.\r\n\r\nSo Agnes decided to request loan again with Kiva field partner, Ahon sa Hirap Inc.

She will used the loan to buy fishing cages (fish traps), fishing nets, and other things that are needed in her fishing business.

Malis, Brooke's Point, Palawan.  She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures: a general store and a copra business.  Her husband Alvin Y., who is 31 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have one child who is 1 year old. \r\n\r\nTenocra joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family.  With the help of her past 12 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Tenocra has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow.  Her previous loan of PHP 29,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, thus increasing the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 13th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 29,500 which she intends to use to buy stock for her general store so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her child and improve her businesses.  Tenocra Y. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.  \r\n\r\nHelp NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by clicking the link to the NWTF Kiva lending team  on Kiva.org to join our team.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":656392,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase more stock to sell to customers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Brookes Point, Palawan","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":145,"posted_date":"2010-12-03T02:10:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tenocra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":29500,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2269.2},{"due_date":"2010-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2269.2},{"due_date":"2011-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2269.2},{"due_date":"2011-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":2269.2},{"due_date":"2011-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2269.2},{"due_date":"2011-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":2269.2},{"due_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2269.2},{"due_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2269.2},{"due_date":"2011-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":2269.2},{"due_date":"2011-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2269.2},{"due_date":"2011-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2269.2},{"due_date":"2011-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2269.2},{"due_date":"2011-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2269.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.92},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.92},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.93},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.92},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.92},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.92},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.93},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.92},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.92},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.92},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.93},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.92},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.93}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":103.84,"local_amount":4538.4,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:10:43Z","rounded_local_amount":4560.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188729862,"comment":null},{"amount":207.69,"local_amount":9076.8,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:47:49Z","rounded_local_amount":9120.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191467825,"comment":null},{"amount":207.69,"local_amount":9076.8,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-16T08:52:15Z","rounded_local_amount":9120.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196030511,"comment":null},{"amount":155.78,"local_amount":6808,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:39:27Z","rounded_local_amount":6840.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201331660,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-12-07T00:08:24Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T11:39:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":254442,"name":"Tam's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tam T.

N. is a married woman who lives in Cordova, Brgy. Cogon, Lapu-lapu City, Cebu.  She earns her living by operating a Sari- Sari (general store) business.  Her husband Angelito N., who is 39 years old, works as a laborer to earn his living.  They have 3 children who are between 6 to 10 years old years old and are all currently going to school. \r\n\r\nBienvinida joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family.  With the help of her past 5 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Bienvinida has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow.  Her previous loan of PHP 15,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 25,000, increasing the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 6th loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000, which she intends to use to pay for more stock to sell so that she can continue to save for future purposes.  Bienvinida N. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work. \r\n\r\nHelp NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by clicking  the link to the  NWTF Kiva lending team on Kiva.org to join our

She earns her living by operating three business ventures: a general store, an electronic reloading business and a frozen products business. Her husband Richard D., who is 41 years old, works as a painter in Dubai. They have three children between 10 and 20 years old. \r\n\r\nElvira joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2009 because she aspired for something better for her family.  With the help of her past three loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Elvira has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 10,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 20,000 PHP, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her fourth cycle loan, she is borrowing 10,000 PHP to use as working capital to continue to save for the future.  Elvira D. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means honorable). Through its alleviation program, NWTF is empowering women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass their dreams. They have chosen a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Balacan, Brgy. Pangobilian, Brookes Point, Palawan. She earns her living by operating two business ventures: selling fish selling and raising hogs. Her husband Billy A., who is 62 years old, works as a carpenter to earn his living and helps with his wife\u2019s business activities.  They have three children between 29 to 40 years old. \r\n\r\nIluminada joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 18 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Iluminada has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 29,500 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 6,000 PHP to improve the family\u2019s standard of living.  \r\n\r\nFor for her 19th loan, Iluminada is borrowing 29,500 PHP to buy fresh fish to sell at the market and to continue to saving to improve her business and provide for the education of her grandchildren. Iluminada A. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means honorable).

Elizabeth is now borrowing 11,000 PHP so that she can purchase additional inventory to sell. This will be her fourth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 9,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom.

H. is a married woman who lives in Tagdalungon, Brgy. Rio Tuba, Bataraza, Palawan. She earns her living by operating a dried fish sales business. Her husband, Haji Mahmod, who is 40 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have three children aged between 11 and 26. \r\n\r\n<p>Habiba joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she hoped for something better for her family. With the help of her past 8 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon and her own efforts, Habiba has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty. Her previous loan of PHP 19,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, thus raising the family's standard of living. This time, for her 9th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 23,000 which she intends to use as additional capital for her business. She intends to sell her dried fish at the central market and continue to save up for her children's future education. Habiba H. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\n<p>About NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

G. is a married woman who lives in Cordova, Brgy. Cogon, Lapu-Lapu City, Cebu. She earns her living by operating a sari-sari (general) store. Her husband, Garry G., is 33 years old and works as a security guard. They have 1 child who is 9 years old. \r\n\r\nMielin joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 7 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Mielin has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 7,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 20,000 PHP, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 8th cycle loan, she is borrowing 12,000 PHP, which she intends to use as additional working capital for the general store so that she can continue to save up for the future and for her business. \r\n\r\nMielin G. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2004 and has improved her living conditions through her own efforts and with the help of her loans from NWTF.  By working hard in her fish selling business, Lolita is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of 13,000 PHP.  \r\n\r\nLolita is now borrowing 29,500 PHP so that she can continue to fund her fish vending operations. This will be her 18th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 28,000 PHP, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom. Lolita aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well being by following the Dungganon way.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Tolibjon is a very responsible and optimistic person. He has three children and a wife to support, so he wants to develop his business.

Tolibjon is helped by his children. He is currently faced with many problems because his children are growing and their expenses are growing accordingly. The only way to get out of this difficulty is to succeed in business, so we hope that his capabilities along with services provided by IMON International will help him improve his business.                                   \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Behruz is a very courageous man who is characterized as someone who can manage tough jobs like raising livestock.  He has one child and has the responsibility of supporting his family and providing them with everything that they need.  Inspite of his difficult economic situation, and after much time, Behruz has been able to get ahead in his business through the purchase of animals to breed on his property. His greatest goal nowadays is to improve his economic situation and provide a better way of life for his family.  It's for this reason that Behruz comes to IMON International for loans for the purchase of animals so that he may breed them.  \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule.  It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi.  The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R. further damaged the already weak economy  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Salohiddin is 29 years old. He is married with two children. Salohiddin is dedicated to his agricultural business. Having little knowledge in the beginning, he had to learn a lot about farming. As of now, he has acquired a fair experience in agriculture.  Salohiddin is very happy, for his 2 children who are the motivation for his desire to grow his business. He approached IMON International to obtain a loan to buy more ingredients; seeds and fertilizer. This will enable him to sow for a good harvest and to take care of his children and his home.   \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007 IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is a farmer growing vegetables, something he has done for 6 years. This is the only thing he knows how to do and what he likes most. For Klichboy, there is nothing better than being in touch with nature and watching the fruit of his labor grow year after year.\r\n\r\n In addition, Klichboy raises cattle and his family helps him with his business.

This is the fourth loan of Klichboy from IMON International and he promises to repay the current loan without any violations and thanks all lenders for their support.   \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This will increase his production of dairy products, thereby increasing his income.\r\n\r\nHis first loan can be seen here: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/lend\/51997"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1893.75,"image":{"id":656686,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Buying cows","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AZ","country":"Azerbaijan","town":"Fuzuli region","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"40.5 47.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":30,"posted_date":"2010-12-02T17:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Malik","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"AZN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":2525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2012-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2012-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":631.25},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":631.25},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":631.25},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":631.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":631.25,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T09:48:14Z","rounded_local_amount":504.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227081492,"comment":null},{"amount":631.25,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:30:31Z","rounded_local_amount":504.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244609248,"comment":null},{"amount":631.25,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:15:47Z","rounded_local_amount":504.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263373802,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-12-25T02:00:15Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}}]}
