She is 49 years old, married, and has 6 children. She lives in the hamlet of La Puerta in the Lepaguare community in Olancho.\r\nShe started out earning a living selling cosmetics, but now she sells second hand clothes for kids and bedding. She had the idea to start this business after seeing some of her neighbors selling clothes and doing well from it. So, she bought a bundle of clothes and got very good returns and also was able to keep some items for her own use. She does not have set work hours, but her customers can come and find her in her house and she also goes around the community making sales when she has finished the daily housework. One of the advantages of this work is that the income enables her to help her husband with the household expenses.

Saturnina L. is from the village of Dimaluna, Ozamiz City. She is 46 years old, married, and has two adult and two school-aged children. To make a living, Saturnina owns and operates a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Saturnina has been engaged in her business for more than ten years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn July 2009, Saturnina joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve both her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 14,995 PHP from PMPC.\r\n\r\nSaturnina is requesting a new loan of 14,995 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products for her retail store. This will be her fourth loan from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family and to save for future emergencies.\r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":620278,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Pandan, Bogo City, Cebu. She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures: General (Sari-sari) store and Tricycle business. Her husband Artemio P., who is 51 years old, works as a tricycle driver to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have 5 children who are 15 to 25 years old. Rowena joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2006 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 4 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Rowena has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 13,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 9,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 5th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 14,000 which she intends to use to purchase more stocks for the general store so that she could continue to save up for the education of her children. Rowena P. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. About NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nTita is married and has five school-aged children. To make a living, Tita owns & operates a business doing direct selling of AVON and Personal Collections cosmetics products in the local community. Tita is just starting this business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Tita joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Tita is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Tita from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is 50 years old. Amihan is the group leader of a 7-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nAmihan is widowed and has 4 school-aged children. To make a living, Amihan owns & operates a business venture in the services sector operating a tailoring business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from providing general alteration & tailoring services to local community members. Amihan has been engaged in her business for over 16 years and earns approximately 4000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Amihan joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Amihan is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional tailoring equipment such as needles & threads. This loan will be the 1st loan taken out by Amihan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Rosalin is the group leader of a 5-member group loan offered by PMPC. While each of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Rosalin Orcullos\u2019s Group.\r\nRosalin is married to Walther, a security guard of Johanne\u2019s Cuisine. They are blessed with 2 children of school age. To help her husband, she decided to engage in micro business particularly in processing fish ball for her snack vending activity.  For 2 years already, she has been able to maintain the said business activity and this time she is earning an average net income of not less than P3,500.00 a month in which the said amount is so helpful to their family income. Upon hearing the good news of PAGLAUM MPC for being one of the most outstanding cooperative in Northern Mindanao and awarded coop for being Most Outstanding Cooperative in the Philippines during the search for COOP-LGU Partnership Award 2006 and awarded for CUMI Performance Award she joined  the cooperative just this year. As a newly recognized member of the PDP-LP Program of PAGLAUM MPC, a micro-finance program that reached out the rural poor, she is requesting an amount of P5,000.00 as her 1st loan to be used for additional capital for her fish ball vending activity. The future income from this loan will be used to improve the living conditions for her family, to meet their basic needs, make loan repayments to PMPC, provide for their children\u2019s education and for possible business

She is 39 years old, married, and has one school-aged child. Marife is the group leader of a four-member group loan offered by PMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Marife E.\u2019s Group.\r\n\r\nTo make a living, Marife owns and operates a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Marife has been engaged in her business for more than fifteen years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Marife joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Marife has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Marife is requesting a new loan of 14,900 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and working capital. This loan will be the third taken out by Marife from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living condition of her family.\r\n\r\nAbout PMPC: Paglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model. \r\n\r\nAbout Group Loans \r\n\r\nIn a group loan, each member of the group receives an individual loan but is part of a group of individuals bound by a group guarantee. Under this arrangement, each member of the group supports one another and is responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or default. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":620260,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase additional inventory and working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Gango, Ozamis City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":126,"posted_date":"2010-10-19T11:30:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":950,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marife ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elvira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ma.

G. is from the village of Bagong Tanza. She is 44 years old. Anita is married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Anita owns & operates a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of different products in the local community using a motorcycle. Anita has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 8000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Anita joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Anita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 23,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase new items to expand product offering. Anita is requesting a new loan of 23,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the 8th loan taken out by Anita from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

Marilou is requesting a new loan of 7000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand product offering. This will be the 2nd loan taken out by Marilou from ASKI.

M. is from the village of Bungad. She is 43 years old. Elvita is married and has two adult children. To make a living, Elvita owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from raising pigs for fattening and sale. Elvita has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 4000 PHP when she sells one of her raised animals.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Elvita joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Elvita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 30,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise & sell in future. Elvita is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise & sell in future. This will be the 7th loan taken out by Elvita from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

B. is from the village of Bungad. She is 21 years old. Nora is married and has one infant child. To make a living, Nora owns & operates a business venture in the food sector making & selling food. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from preparing and selling ice cream. Nora has been engaged in her business for over 2 years and earns approximately 4000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Nora joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Nora has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. Nora is requesting a new loan of 8000 PHP which will be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. This will be the 2nd loan taken out by Nora from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is 46 years old. Arlene is the group leader of a 5-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nArlene is married and has 2 school-aged children. To make a living, Arlene owns & operates a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Arlene has been engaged in her business for over 6 years and earns approximately 3000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Arlene joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Arlene is requesting a loan of 4000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand product offering. This will be the 1st loan taken out by Arlene from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

D. is from the village of Brgy. Vista Alegre, Bayombong, Nueva Vizcaya. She is 56 years old. Veleria is widowed and has 9 adult children. To make a living, Veleria owns & operates a business venture in the food sector making & selling food. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from preparing and selling cooked food for daily meals. Veleria has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 4500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Veleria joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Veleria has successfully repaid a previous loan of 13,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. Veleria is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the 10th loan taken out by Veleria from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas.

Edna is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the first loan taken out by Edna from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\n<b>About ASKI:<\/b>\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 34 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":619452,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Kiva borrower is a 22 year old single man from Lebanon. He is a relatively new business owner - he has worked as a sanitary worker repairing toilets, faucets, etc. for the past five years. As per the majority of Lebanese men, he helps his family with the household expenses. All family members need to cooperate together to be able to meet the heavy expenses of daily life.

On average, they are 48 years old with 9 children and live in Somono and Bozo large traditional families in the village of Belenithiegni, San prefecture (Segou region, republic of Mali).  They know one another through ties of community and kinship. They are engaged in nearly the same business selling fresh and smoked fish. This is the group's seventh solidarity loan with Soro Yiriwaso.  Diaou H., president of the group, specializes in selling fresh fish.  She plans to buy wholesale a large quantity of fresh fish of all kinds from the group's husbands, brothers and children who fish.

H. is from the village of Linconcomonan, Gingoog City. She is 42 years old. Virginia is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Virginia owns and operates a business venture in the food sector making and selling food. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of viands in different meals, and running a sari-sari store in the local community. Virginia has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Virginia joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Virginia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to invest in expanding the business. Virginia is requesting a new loan of 11,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. This loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by Virginia from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

A. is from the village of San Andres, Kadingilan, Bukidnon. She is 39 years old. Amalia is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Amalia owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector running a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food & daily use products in the local community. Amalia has been engaged in her business for over 1 year and earns approximately 5000 PHP per month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Amalia joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Amalia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell in her shop. Amalia is requesting a new loan of 8000 PHP which will be used as working capital and to purchase additional inventory. This loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by Amalia from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

L. is from the village of Kipaducan, Pangantucan, Bukidnon. She is 27 years old. Jovie is married and has 4 school-aged children. To make a living, Jovie owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector running a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food & daily use products in the local community. Jovie has been engaged in her business for over 2 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP per month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Jovie joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Jovie has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell in her shop. Jovie is requesting a new loan of 8000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. This loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by Jovie from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

is not married and lives with her family, including her parents and brothers. She runs a small business selling perfumes, cosmetics, wedding gifts, kids\u2019 toys and others. Her business is located at the central market in Shahrituz, Tajikistan. This good location brings in many customers and makes her business a success. Matlubakhon has been in this business for 5 years. The business brings a stable income to Matlubakhon's family. Her goal is to develop the business further, rent a larger facility, and begin selling items in bulk. She would like to borrow $2,500 USD to purchase more inventory. Matlubakhon hopes to increase her sales and earn additional income.\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

K. started up his transport business four years ago with motorcycles commonly known as \u201cboda boda.\u201d These are a common means of transport and are convenient in timely situations like traffic jams and the bad road systems in Uganda. He has made a good profit out of it, earning 280,000 Ugandan shillings monthly. \r\n\r\nHis main setback is that he needs to expand the business by buying additional motorcycles and allocating them in different stages so as to increase his revenue. His future plan is to buy a car for \"matatu\" (taxi) usage to earn him more money. With this loan, he hopes to achieve that aforementioned goal and thus will be able to take care of his family.

P. is a married woman who lives in Lower Calasa, Brgy. Caradio-an, Himamaylan, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating three business ventures:  Sugarcane plantation, rice field and fish selling businesses.  Her husband Simeon P., who is 34 years old, works as a Laborer to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have four children who are 7 to 20 years old. \r\n\r\nMelinda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 10 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Melinda has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 7,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 11th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 13,000 which she intends to use as additional capital in her fish vending and to purchase fertilizer for her farm so that she could continue to save up for future house repairs and her children's education. \r\n\r\nMelinda P. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She lives in Prk. Orchids, Brgy. Talacagay, Hinobaan, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2007 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard at raising pigs , tricycle transport and food vending businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 4000. \r\n\r\nRozel is now borrowing PHP 12000 so that she  could  fund the operation of raising her pigs.  This will be her 7th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 12000, which she paid off well within its term was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Rozel aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the  Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

Malinawun, Brgy. Mabini, Escalante City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating a business venture: Mango and Banana plantation business.  Her husband Diosdado, who is 53 years old, works as a Farmer to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have four children who are 23 to 29 years old. \r\n\r\nEvelyn joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1996 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 15 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Evelyn has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 7,500, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 16th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 19,500 which she intends to use to buy pesticides and equipment for her mango plantation so that she could continue to save up for future home repairs and the expansion of her business. Evelyn P. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

T. is a married woman who lives in Hda. Amparo, Brgy. Mabini, Escalante City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures:  tailoring and livestock businesses. Her husband Jerry, who is 44 years old, works as a carpenter to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have nine children who are 9 to 22 years old.\r\n\r\n Letecia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2006 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past eight loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Letecia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 9th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000 which she intends to use to buy raw materials for her tailoring business so that she could continue to save up for the future of her children's education and expansion of her business. \r\n\r\nLetecia T. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Kalubihan, Brgy. Libertad, Escalante City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  General Store and Livestock businesses. Her husband Glicerio, who is 64 years old, is a retired employee who helps in his wife's business activities.  They have 9 children who are 22 to 30 years old. \r\n\r\nShirly joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2006 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past seven loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Shirly has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 12,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 3,500, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 8th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 12,000 which she intends to use to  purchase more stocks for her general store so that she could continue to save up for the education of her grandchildren and expansion of her business. \r\n\r\nShirly S. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.
