She purchases clothes from the city of Faisalabad, famous for its textiles, and sells to her neighborhood clients. Her husband's name is Rasheed A.. He is a loader by profession. He loads everything from fruits and vegetables to construction supplies and delivers to the designated places. To deliver the items, he used his own donkey cart. He earns income on a daily business which helps manage the household expenses.\r\n\r\nZahida has applied for a loan from Asasah to invest in her husband\u2019s business. He will buy a new donkey cart with the money, because the old cart has become rotted in different areas which gives him trouble loading items. Zahida is hoping that this investment will help her husband work better and increase his income.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":559047,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","use":"To

This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills.  Afterwards, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses.  These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance.  Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in

The loan will be used to buy 30 or more bunches of bananas, which she then hopes to sell in the market.  Immaculate hopes to generate profit from selling bananas to enable her to develop her business and sell other types of goods.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote to lenders: BRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product to Kiva which funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

Afterwards, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses.  These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance.  Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in microfinance."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":559093,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

She has a sound and solid relationship with the Kiva\/ASHI partnership.\r\n\r\nNow, Loriza is proposing another Kiva loan to advance her growing business, which she has been able to improve due to her access to bigger loans from Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\nLoriza also revealed the massive impact the loan has made on her family. With the additional income, she was able to afford to buy desired needs for her family and ensure prompt weekly payment of her obligation to ASHI. Loriza is also happy because she is able to support her husband in meeting the family's needs. The couple love what they do in making their business succeed. For her, it is joy to see fulfillment in her business and family and, with her children growing up, she wants to see them having a decent life someday.\r\n\r\nLoriza is thankful to ASHI and Kiva lenders for their continuous support of her dreams. Her long term goals are to provide a sustainable life for her family and enable them to build their own comfortable house to live in.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":559097,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Natural Medicines","sector":"Health","use":"to

Murod is 47 years old. He is married and has 5 children. Murod is very diligent and hard-working young man. With his own car, he is providing  taxi services. For the last 10 years the current business has been the main income for the family, allowing Murod to improve the living conditions of his large family. As with any business, Murod's business also requires some investment from time to time. Thus, now his car needs some fixing. For this purpose Murod requests 4700 Somoni. Murod promises to repay the loan promptly and thanks all those supporting him.  \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

She is the mother of two children, aged 3 and 6 years of which one is in school. She has known serious household troubles because her husband mistreated her, which was the reason she was forced to divorce him. She is asking for a Kiva loan to increase to quantity of rice she buys and can resell to her clients.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is consistent in paying her dues because she uses the money she borrows to expand and improve her barber shop.     \r\n\r\nTo ensure the success of her business, she would like to apply for a PHP 17,000 loan. This amount will be used as a source of added capital to her expanding business by buying equipment and expanding her barber shop.

Bibiana tells us that \"currently, I attend to more than 50 customers and my greatest satisfaction is that my customers tell me that my food is delicious.\"  With this business she has earnings that she can use for her personal expenses, and she can also use part of the earnings to invest in more supplies to continue the business.\r\n\r\nBibiana tells us that, \"In my community of Marcelino Rodriguez, the climate is very hot and there is a very pretty plantation and a river that passes through the middle of  the town.

Four of the children are currently going to school and also help their parents in the business as part of their daily chores. One is already married while the other one is working and helping Pacencia.\r\n\r\nPacencia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve the quality of life for their family. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD, she has been able to increase their family income by engaging in a clothes rental business and her tailoring. Now she earns an average monthly income of PHP 10,000 from her business activities.\r\n\r\nPacencia is a member of good standing. Her previous loan of PHP 29,500 was used to fund operations of her dress shop and tailoring business and it had a positive impact on both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is borrowing for her 13th cycle loan, the amount of PHP 29,500, which she intends to use on her dress shop and tailoring business. Pacencia is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which is to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

We are going to talk about Adriana Betzabel. She is the daughter of Marisela, and as we can see they are both novices who are looking to get ahead with their loans. Adriana is 23, did 3 years of high school, is a single mother and has one little angel named Carla Selene, age 5, who is just about to start preschool. Adriana currently lives with her parents, and bit by bit the way is becoming smooth for her. She started her business selling meat jerky, sausage and beef enchiladas. She tells me that she would like to get ahead professionally, learn and start a career in information technology in order to offer her daughter and herself a better life...how? Through obtaining a better job and more income. With this opportunity she will achieve what she most desires: owning her own home. She tells me that her group is very united and that they are doing their best in their activities so that they do not lose the benefits of continued support that Fundacion Realidad and Kiva have offered them. They are also very grateful and hope to continue with many more cycles because without these credits they would not have been able to start their businesses<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Christine Cooper, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1450,"image":{"id":554916,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"the purchase of meat jerky and sausage","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"TEPALCINGO MORELOS","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2010-06-24T02:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marisela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria De Los Angeles","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adriana Betzabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":18000,"loan_amount":1450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2010-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2010-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2010-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2010-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2010-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2010-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2010-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2010-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2010-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2010-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2010-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1125}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.63},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.62},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.63},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.62},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.63},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.62},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.63},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.62},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.63},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.62},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.63},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.62},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.63},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.62},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.63},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":181.25,"local_amount":2250,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:50:05Z","rounded_local_amount":2288.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151899591,"comment":null},{"amount":453.13,"local_amount":5625,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:17:28Z","rounded_local_amount":5721.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159639938,"comment":null},{"amount":362.5,"local_amount":4500,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:21:21Z","rounded_local_amount":4577.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166854220,"comment":null},{"amount":362.5,"local_amount":4500,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:11:15Z","rounded_local_amount":4577.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172121117,"comment":null},{"amount":90.62,"local_amount":1125,"processed_date":"2010-11-01T06:59:59Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:26:31Z","rounded_local_amount":1144.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177415420,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-06-25T01:41:26Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T14:26:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":210208,"name":"Liza","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La  Sra.

The story is about Ms. Mar\u00eda L\u00f3pez Garc\u00eda, since she is one of the members of this group. She is 44 years old, married to a construction worker, and has three school-aged children: Leonel, Uriel and Luis Angel, two of whom are studying in secondary school and one in high school. She makes and sells traditional corn-based Mexican dishes such as enchiladas, soups and pastas, and also hand-made tortillas. \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda says she chose home-made food sales as her business because it is a very good source of income. She will invest her loan in the purchase of the ingredients she uses to prepare the food which are: firewood, corn, potatoes, poblano and green chiles, jitomates, tomatoes and cheese. She will also buy ingredients for her \u201caguas frescas\u201d (light fruit juices): pineapple, watermelon, other melons, oranges and mangoes. \r\n\r\nHer business is helping now that the end of classes is near since two of her children are going to graduate, one from secondary school and the other from high school, and she will have some graduation expenses for them such as shoes and uniforms as well as the donations they are soliciting at the schools. She would also like to improve her business, leveling out the ground and putting in some flooring since it is a dirt floor, and to buy a canvas to use as a roof for her business, and tables and chairs. \r\n\r\nHer business provides a real benefit to the people in her community because now they do not have to travel so far to buy their food and tortillas, given that some people in her community prefer to buy prepared food so as not to have to cook at home. \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda wants her children to have a profession since she herself did not have the opportunity to study for one. She is thinking that in addition to selling prepared food she can sell fruits and vegetables since in her area people have to travel to the city to buy produce and there would be no competition for that business in her neighborhood. \r\n\r\nShe mentions that her group works together very well, since all the members know each other and are very responsible with their payments. \r\n\r\nAnd these are the names and business activities each one of the members carries out:\r\n\r\nOralia S.

In this group every member  makes her own decisions since they are all comfortable being a part of Lucerito. The are from the San Miguel Xico 3ra Seccion neighborhood of Valle de Chalco, State of Mexico. This group is in their third cycle and hope to remain in Fundacion Realidad since the support has been helpful to them. \r\n\r\nGroup member Angela D. O. is 74, widowed 6 yeas ago, and has four married children. She started working from a very young age as her parents were unable to give her the chance to study since she had to care for her other siblings. She started out with a small store where her husband helped out, though she had to close the store when she was widowed since she didn't have help stocking the store. Some time later she began selling dried chilies, plantain leaves, cinnamon, nuts and others since this is a relatively low intensity activity. Angela opens at 10 in the morning and closes at 4 pm so that she can deliver her orders to her neighbors in the area. Angela would like to re-open her store and hire someone to help with sales. \r\n\r\nWith this loan she hopes to buy plantain and corn leaves for tamales, since this is the time of year they sell best, and also be able to buy top quality product to improve her customer base. \r\n\r\nThe other group members are as follows:\r\nJulia M.

Antonia H. formed the group with her god-daughter, Margarita G. R., and Maria Marlene G. H.. Each of the three are in diifferent lines of work. Antonia is seeking the loan to buy coconuts, to sell along with horchata (a local soft drink), for which she needs ingredients such as sugar, milk and cinnamon. She will also have the support of her husband, David Vazquez Farelo, who will go out and sell them.\r\n\r\nThe second member of the group, Margarita G. R., sells clothes, including trousers, T-shirts, shirts and blouses among other things. The third member of the group, Maria Marlene G. H., sells agricultural supplies.\r\n\r\nAntonia is happy and content that she has already benefited by investing in products such as these. She says there has been no difficulty with her husband going out and selling them in the park in Copinala Chiapas, which is just five minutes from their home. Her most treasured dream is to keep working with this loan, and save up so she can help her grandchildren through school.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Rosa Oswald, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":553443,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","use":"To buy coconuts and ingredients such as sugar, milk and cinnamon","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"COPAINAL\u00c1, CHIAPAS","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2010-06-23T18:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Antonia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Marlene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":8000,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":928.19},{"due_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":947.85},{"due_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":967.93},{"due_date":"2010-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":988.43},{"due_date":"2010-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1009.37},{"due_date":"2010-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1030.75},{"due_date":"2010-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1052.58},{"due_date":"2010-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1074.9}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.42},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.01},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.64},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.31},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.01},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.75},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.52},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":152.43,"local_amount":1876.04,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:50:12Z","rounded_local_amount":1924.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151899594,"comment":null},{"amount":158.95,"local_amount":1956.36,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:17:19Z","rounded_local_amount":2007.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159639941,"comment":null},{"amount":144.16,"local_amount":1774.22,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:21:27Z","rounded_local_amount":1820.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166854223,"comment":null},{"amount":194.46,"local_amount":2393.38,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-18T07:59:16Z","rounded_local_amount":2455.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172121120,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-06-24T04:40:52Z","paid_date":"2010-10-18T07:59:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":210228,"name":"Lucia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Lucia, de 40 a\u00f1os, es una mujer muy trabajadora y alegre, vive en su casa propia junto a sus 4 queridos hijos y lo que m\u00e1s desea es brindarles una mejor vida.

The members learned about the loan program from announcements and from the coordinators.\r\n\r\nMarina is originally from Coapilla, Chiapas, 72 years old, and married since the age of 18 to Pedro from the same locality.  They have 7 children, all married now.\r\n\r\nMarina's motive for requesting a loan is to buy ingredients and make bread to sell. To do this, she needs wheat flour, cooking oil, eggs, milk, yeast, and sugar, plus other items.  She can count on the help of her husband who works in the countryside.\r\n\r\nMarina is very content with the service offered by the Fundacion Realidad (Reality Foundation). Her dream is to save in order to continue with her work.  Her 'illusion' is to travel to Cancun in Quintana Roo, and to keep her business until God takes her life.\r\n\r\nThe other 2 group members will utilize the loan as follows: Flor de Luz will buy creams, peroxide, hair coloring, and rollers for her beauty shop.  Her companion Magdali will use the loan to supply her taco shop. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Harold Sims, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":553360,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","use":"BUYING INGREDIENTS TO MAKE BREADS (SUGAR, EGGS, FLOUR, YEAST, OIL, AND MILK), AND OTHER SUPPLIES FOR 3 BUSINESSES ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"COPAINAL\u00c1, CHIAPAS","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2010-06-23T18:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Flor De Luz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Magdali","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":9000,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2010-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2010-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2010-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2010-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1125}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.63},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.62},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.63},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.62},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.63},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.62},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.63},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":181.25,"local_amount":2250,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:50:14Z","rounded_local_amount":2288.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151899595,"comment":null},{"amount":181.25,"local_amount":2250,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:17:23Z","rounded_local_amount":2288.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159639942,"comment":null},{"amount":181.25,"local_amount":2250,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:21:15Z","rounded_local_amount":2288.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166854224,"comment":null},{"amount":181.25,"local_amount":2250,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:11:09Z","rounded_local_amount":2288.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172121121,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-06-23T23:56:53Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:11:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":210232,"name":"Sharifa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sharifa I. sells dresses and panties at Abura.

He lives in his own home with his wife, Dominica (36 years old) and their two youngest children who are the reason for all of his hard work.  With much work, Marcelino has been able to give his family a good start in life by working laboriously on his banana and coffee crops by making sure that they are of very good quality since he depends on selling them quickly.  What he enjoys most about his work is sowing the fields despite having to get rid of the plagues which hurt the crops most of the time.  In the future he hopes to buy new lands to increase his crop production.

Besides the loans, FMSD has also helped her learn small business techniques through entrepreneurial training sessions and access to various fairs and special events. She is very open-minded and always trying to learn new things to improve her business and herself as a person. Shany wants to use this Kiva loan to buy materials to use in the creation of her handicrafts that she can then sell in Bogota at the Feria Empresarial de la Mujer (\u201cwomen's industry fair\u201d).\r\n\r\nShany's dream is to begin exporting her products, as well as to get her own store and home for her family. Her biggest challenge is liquidity: clients often don't want to pay her up front for their special orders meaning she has to pay for the materials out of pocket. This is especially true when she goes to fairs and needs to make a lot in advance. This loan will help her overcome that, ensuring rapid production of the anticipated handicrafts.

Indeed, the high-pitched voices of the more than 30 tiny students swell up through the house during the day and seem to be music to the ears of this happy, smiling couple. \r\n\r\nJorge sells natural medicines and takes pride in his work managing the health of his neighbors. He was born in Arenal, in the neighboring state of Bolivar, but has lived in Barranquilla since he was 14. He came here looking for a future and he found it, first going to the university until financial problems forced him to drop out of his Economics program and take a job at a local bank. He worked there for 5 years, and after losing his job began selling natural products. \r\n\r\nHis tubercular father had done this before him, and Jorge took advantage of that to take on his father's former clients to kickstart his business. This also permitted him to branch out of his neighborhood along with several of his friends, and they all  began selling their goods throughout various municipalities in Barranquilla and then in the neighboring states of Cesar and Guajira, then on in to Venezuela. \r\n\r\nThanks to this business (and the hard work his wife has done), Jorge has been able to take care of his home and family. This loan will be his first credit from Kiva and Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and he plans to use it to buy natural medicines such as antihistamines, vitamins, minerals, anti-aging products and even honey (to sweeten the taste of some of the more bitter medications), all to sell in his business. Jorge dreams of buying a place where he can independently showcase and sell his products.

children. For her, the skill was a family tradition she perfected over years of practice and study, along the way making a bit of a name for herself in the neighborhood, thanks to the high quality of her work. \r\n\r\nLucy came to Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo one year ago and has now applied for her second loan, this time with Kiva, that she plans to use to buy primary materials such as fabrics, thread, and buttons to turn into dresses based on her clients' measurements. Since she started with FMSD, Lucy has bought her materials in an efficient manner, without needing to maintain a special inventory that could potentially deteriorate over time in the humid climate. \r\n\r\nLucy's biggest challenge is that her workspace is cramped and is located within her family's home (a condition which currently leads to longer work days than she'd prefer). She dreams of setting up a workshop completely separate from her home so as to put a bit of space between her professional and personal lives. She also envisions her children (aged 15 and 21) becoming professionals and for that reason she and her husband work hard to encourage and finance their studies. \r\n\r\n[EN ESPANOL]\r\nLucy S. Dom\u00ednguez domina el maravilloso arte de la confecci\u00f3n, por eso cre\u00f3 su microempresa donde fabrica todo tipo de ropa en  las l\u00edneas  femenina, masculina e infantil; ella aprendi\u00f3 a preparar, cortar y ensamblar piezas por tradici\u00f3n familiar y poco a poco, mediante el estudio ha ido perfeccionando sus t\u00e9cnicas, por eso hoy tiene muchas personas, que reconocen  su trabajo de calidad y se han sostenido como sus clientes. Desde hace un a\u00f1o pertenece a los programas de la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo y este es su segundo cr\u00e9dito por valor de $2.000.000 COP, con el cual va comprar materias primas, como telas e hilos y botones que le faciliten elaborar vestidos sobre medidas que le han solicitado sus clientes. Desde que ella accedi\u00f3 a cr\u00e9ditos con esta organizaci\u00f3n compra de manera eficiente, sin necesidad de mantener un Stock de inventarios que puedan deteriorarse, porque ahora se ha organizado en este sentido.\r\nSu sue\u00f1o m\u00e1s importante es establecer un taller totalmente separado de su medio familiar, para no mezclar sus responsabilidades productivas y domesticas y  muchas veces extender sus  jornadas de trabajo. Igualmente visiona a sus hijos de 21 y 15 a\u00f1os como unos profesionales de calidad y por eso ella con su c\u00f3nyuge trabajan persistentemente para conseguir esta meta. Su mayor desaf\u00edo es lograr alg\u00fan d\u00eda tener un amplio local donde establecer su taller, porque el que actualmente tiene es muy estrecho.\r\n

Con el tiempo, desea comprar m\u00e1s tierras, para incrementar su producci\u00f3n de caf\u00e9 que actualmente produce. Este es su segundo cr\u00e9dito con MFP y se siente en la capacidad de pagar todas sus cuotas, es uno de los miembros m\u00e1s activos en su grupo comunal, por eso es muy querido y respetado. Con los seiscientos nuevos soles que solicita, comprar\u00e1 fertilizantes para que sean productivas sus tierras.\n\n","en":"Simon is 54 years old; he is a father and is a happy and hardworking man.  He lives in his own home with his wife Andrea (36 years old) and his three lovely children whom he wishes to give a better quality of life.  For more than 25 years he has been growing bananas and coffee and with his wife they go very early to work on the land so that it can be productive and the crops can be sold quickly.  He enjoys his work very much despite having to take care of his plants constantly so that insects don\u2019t attack and hurt his crops.  In the future he hopes to buy more land to increase his coffee production.  This is Simon's second loan with MFP (Kiva\u2019s field partner) and he feels able to pay all of his quotas; he is one of the most active members of his communal bank and that is why he is very well-liked and respected.

She loves her children very much and hopes to give them a better quality of life. \r\n\r\nFrom a young age Catalina learned to work on the farm alongside her parents, who showed her everything that needed to be done to have a successful harvest. Now she has her own land that she cultivates and tends to with love and patience. She plants peas, potatoes, olluco [a root vegetable] and barley which she sells at the wholesale market in Tarma. What she enjoys most about her work is harvesting her crops, since that is when she is rewarded for all her effort. She has been doing this for 20 years and says that the hardest part of tending to her crops are the potential plagues. Her wish is to buy more land so she can expand her production. \r\n\r\nThis is her sixth loan with MFP and she knows and is willing to make he payments on time.

His greatest desire is for his family to get ahead in life.\r\n\r\nJuli\u00e1n farms potatoes, corn and peas.  Every morning, he works his land to make it more fertile and productive.  He and his wife work very hard because they know they must work as much as possible in order to pay their children's education expenses.  He enjoys his work very much.  Between the two of them, Juli\u00e1n and Mery protect their crops from pests that can damage their harvest.\r\n\r\nHe has been doing this type of work for 15 years and considers the most difficult aspect to be transporting his products to the market in Tarma, where they are sold.  Within a few days, he hopes to harvest and sell his crops at the market for a good price, and in this manner to save money little by little.  Eventually, he hopes to save enough to open a small grocery store in his community.\r\n\r\nThis is Juli\u00e1n's fifth loan with MFP [Microfinanzas Prisma].

The reason for this name is because these flowers grow in one of the member's homes. The group is situated in the Julian Grajales locality, Copainala municipality in Chiapas state, Mexico. It's also known as 'San Antonio'. The group is made up of 3 ladies who have known each other for 40 years. \r\n\r\nSenora Fredy is Las Azucenas' representative. She is 40 years old, and studied until the third grade of secondary school. Fredy is married to Rofino Farelo Sanchez and in total they have 7 children, 5 of which are under their care: Magdiel (20), Esdra (17), Lia Anilu (14), David (21), who is in the third grade of secondary school, and Yeider (10) who is in the sixth grade of primary school. \r\n\r\nFredy has worked selling bread for 20 years. Before this she worked with her mother, Raquel V. G., whom she supported doing the same activity. Now only Fredy makes bread.

Ovidio works in agriculture cultivating potatoes, maize, olluco (an Andean root vegetable) and peas.  Each day, from early in the morning, he is working on his farm, since he knows that the greater his commitment the greater will be his crop production, which means a guaranteed sale on the wholesale market of Tarma.  What he most likes about his work is the harvest, because this is when he sees the reward for all of his hard work in the fields.  He has been doing this work for 32 years, and what he considers most difficult is having to protect his crops from diseases and pests.

He has been able to get where he is in life by hard work and force of will. The couple runs a sports clothing store, where they sell shirts and hats branded by Colombian soccer teams, particularly the recently crowned national champions and local team Junior de Barranquilla. \r\n\r\nThey have two sales stands side by side where they offer their merchandise: Dagoberto selling t-shirts and general sports wear, while his wife sells hats and also works hard to raise their children in a loving home. Dagoberto used to work selling handicrafts, and before that many other positions, but it's with this current enterprise that he has been able to generate the most stability for his family and find a solid place in the market. \r\n\r\nHis main clients are passersby of Barranquilla's Metropolitan Stadium (the largest stadium in Colombia), the aficionados and sports fans most passionate in the city (and, consequently, most passionate in Colombia, as they tell it).\r\n\r\nDagoberto has requested this loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo (a Kiva partner) to update his inventory and add a sixth star to the Junior jerseys he sells to reflect their championship success in May of this year. Since receiving his previous loans (this is his fourth), he has been able to buy his house and improve it with furniture and other home necessities, as well as take care of his children. He and his wife hope their children grow into professionals; his biggest dream being that one or all of them becomes a doctor.\r\n\r\n[EN ESPANOL]\r\n\r\nDagoberto B., es un hombre luchador que junto a su c\u00f3nyuge han logrado salir adelante mediante el esfuerzo y el trabajo; ambos son comerciantes de ropa deportiva como camisetas y gorras de los equipos del futbol colombiano, especialmente la del Junior de Barranquilla. Tienen 2 puestos de ventas uno al lado del otro donde ofrecen su mercanc\u00eda: por un lado Dagoberto trabaja vendiendo camisetas y en general ropa deportiva y por otro lado su esposa vende gorras y los dos trabajan mucho para ver crecer a sus 3 hijos en las edades de 7, 13 y 10 a\u00f1os con mucho bienestar y convertidos en profesionales. Dagoberto es un hombre que antes de ser comerciante es un artesano de naturaleza, pero ha tenido varios negocios y se ha quedado con el actual debido a que le ha generado mucha estabilidad y le va muy bien en el mercado. Sus principales clientes son los transe\u00fantes de estadio Metropolitano de Barranquilla, los aficionados y fan\u00e1ticos del deporte que mas apasiona en esta ciudad y en toda Colombia el Futbol. En la actualidad est\u00e1 solicitando su cuarto cr\u00e9dito a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo para modernizar su inventario y agregar como insignia la sexta estrella del equipo Junior a todo lo que vende, as\u00ed adicionar\u00e1 una estrella mas a las camisetas que tiene en stock y comprar\u00e1n nuevo surtido con la sexta estrella que exigen sus clientes. Desde que recibi\u00f3 sus cr\u00e9ditos Dagoberto ha logrado comprar y adecuar su vivienda, muebles y enseres necesarios para el hogar y sostener a sus ni\u00f1os en el colegi\u00f3 porque su m\u00e1ximo sue\u00f1o es que alguno elija la medicina como su profesi\u00f3n.

She is a native of San Bernardo del Viento, near Cartagena, where her father worked in the fields and her mother tailored clothing for friends and relatives. Alcira learned the art of dressmaking watching her mother and even started out by making clothing for her dolls as a child. \r\n\r\nWhen she was 19 she got married and moved to Barranquilla, where her husband worked and where she would eventually have three children. Alcira began taking a course in tailoring to learn more and perfect her art. \r\n\r\nAt 27, her husband abandoned her with her young children. Until then she had been working as an employee at a well-known clothier, but her salary  wasn't enough to cover rent, food and the cost of a babysitter for her children while she was at work. So after 16 years, she quit and used her cash on hand to begin her own business that she could run out of her home. \r\n\r\nShe bought two simple, pedal-powered sewing machines and with her mother started to sew and sell her products to shops in malls around Barranquilla. Since then, she has stopped working, meanwhile raising her children to become professionals: an electro-mechanical engineer, an electro-mechanical technician and a doctor. She came to  Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo at the recommendation of a friend. Since then she has received three loans, ranging in size from approximately $400 to $1,500, that have helped her buy equipment and grow her business to the point that she was able to hire three employees, all women heads-of-family. \r\n\r\nWith this loan from Kiva, Alcira plans to buy supplies, including linen, zippers and accessories, to make into clothing for women, men, and children. Currently, her fixed assets include three electric sewing machines, two more advanced\/industrial sewing machines for working with denim, a fabric cutter and a cutting table. \r\n\r\nAlcira is very grateful to her parents, her children and FMSD for giving her a hand in building her business. In the future, she hopes to continue becoming more and more successful so that she can employ more women heads-of-family so that they too can develop as she has.\r\n\r\n[EN ESPANOL]\r\n\r\nAlcira Isabel Ram\u00edrez D. es una mujer muy interesante por su gran creatividad y su gran capacidad de trabajo; oriunda de San Bernardo del Viento, en el departamento de C\u00f3rdoba, lugar donde su padre realizaba labores del campo y su madre confeccionaba ropa a familiares y amigos, aprendi\u00f3 el arte de confeccionar vi\u00e9ndola a ella, e inici\u00f3 haci\u00e9ndole ropa a las mu\u00f1ecas que ten\u00eda en su ni\u00f1ez.

F. is a 51-year-old pepper producer and father of nine who lives in the region of Coquital de Los Chiles de San Carlos, located in Northern Costa Rica. Lucio is a dedicated producer and father. He plans to focus his efforts on the planting and harvest of Tabasco peppers. He works in cooperation with his wife to strike a balance between accomplishing the daily tasks associated with agricultural production and the completion of domestic responsibilities. The land they work is their own. \r\n\r\nIn addition to his agricultural activity, Lucio works at a local Orange producing factory as a harvesting labourer in order to supplement family income. The money he earns helps pay bills for electricity and to buy food. The rural zone where Lucio and his family live is one of the few places in Costa Rica without running water; the family must pump water from a nearby well as needed. Lucio is working hard towards the sustenance of his family, striving to reap the maximum benefits from his land and his labour. \r\n\r\nAlthough this is an individual loan, the community in which Lucio and his family live is very close-knit and interdependent. Neighbours help and support one another by sharing experiences and expertise acquired over the years. All individual members of the Coquital community are dedicated to the improvement of living conditions for the region as a whole.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to finance the production of Tabasco peppers. Specifically, the loan will be used to finance the purchase of a variety of seedlings and necessary agricultural nutrients, fertilizers and chemicals in order to ensure a healthy harvest. All labourial and logistical tasks associated with production will be carried out by Lucio with the help of his family members in the region of Coquital de Los Chiles, located in the Northern Region of Costa Rica. Lucio will need roughly one year before his peppers will reach maturity and be ready for harvest. \r\n\r\nPiper and Capiscum Processors Compa\u00f1\u00eda Agr\u00edcola Industrial, or, PROPICA is an international buyer and seller of chili pepper and ground pepper products. In cooperation with Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer, PROPICA has guaranteed to purchase the agricultural products (the peppers) that are to be produced with the help of this loan. PROPICA acts as a guaranteed client for small agricultural producers in the area of Coquital, thus ensuring that their products will reach market. \r\n\r\nIn general, the work day is divided into mornings and afternoons. In the morning, the domestic tasks are carried out such as cooking, cleaning and sending the children to school. Afternoons are generally dedicated to harvest and planting, working the land as needed. Lucio spends some days working as a labourer in the nearby Orange producing factory, but this work is sporadic. Lucio says that he has had difficulty obtaining access to both financial services and technical assistance with respect to farming.

is 19 years old and lives in the town of Kinoni in the Masaka area of Uganda. She is married and has no children. Margaret has a business selling coffee in Kinoni, which she has had for approximately one year.\r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Margaret is requesting a loan of 200,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda.  The loan will be used for greater supplies of coffee beans that Margaret will purchase in bulk and resell.  Margaret hopes to generate profit from her business that can support herself and her family in the future.\r\n\r\nNote to lenders: BRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product to Kiva which funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.  This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills.  Afterwards, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses.  These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance.  Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in microfinance."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":559220,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","use":"To buy more

The five children attend school normally. The second-hand clothing business is a family business, since her grandmother and her mother did this; she also chose this activity after their deaths. She began in 2004 with a capital of 55,000 francs, and now she would like to assert herself in this business. With the new loan she is going to get, she would like to buy top quality bundles of items, such as unworn clothes, end-of-series towels and unused bedsheets. Her maximum daily turnover is 60,000 francs, and when times are hard, her minimum turnover is 25,000 francs. She is very preoccupied with her children's future and wants to help them succeed by supporting them morally and financially. She has an ambition to open a shop which would be managed from one generation to another and would be left as an inheritance for her children. People close to her consider her to be a fighter and think that she will be really successful.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Le Bras, Kiva

is 20 years old and lives in the town of Kinoni in the Masaka area of Uganda. She is married and has two children. She has a business selling silverfish, which are small dried fish that are very popular in Uganda. Noeline has had her business for approximately two years. Noeline\u2019s business serves the local community by providing an affordable and healthy food source for others in the village.\r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Noeline is requesting a loan of 100,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda.  The loan will be used to buy more silverfish stocks which Noeline can then sell at market. Noeline hopes to generate more profit from the expansion of her business and have more financial support for her family.\r\n\r\nNote to lenders: BRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product to Kiva which funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.  This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills.  Afterwards, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses.  These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance.  Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in microfinance."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":50,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":50,"image":{"id":559217,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","use":"To buy

N. is 19 years old and lives in the town of Kinoni in the Masaka area of Uganda. She is single and has no children. Hellen has a retail shop in Kinoni, in which she sells various goods and foodstuffs.  \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Hellen is requesting a loan of 200,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used for buying more stock of goods and expanding the inventory of her retail store. Hellen hopes to save up money earned from her business and be able to support herself financially and have a family in the future.\r\n\r\n<b>Note to lenders:<\/b> BRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product to Kiva which funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills. Afterward, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses. These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance. Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and to give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in

She will use the loan to buy goods to resell and expand her shop\u2019s inventory. Annet hopes to expand her business and sell more of her inventory, generating profits to help support her family.\r\n<em>\r\n<p>\r\nNote to lenders\r\n<\/em>\r\n<p>\r\nBRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product to Kiva which funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. \r\n<p>\r\nThe ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills. Afterward, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses. These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance. Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans and to give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in

This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills. Afterwards, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses.  These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and to improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance.  Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and it gives Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and to support a promising new sector in

Gorretti is 21 years old and lives in the town of Kyotera, in the Masaka area of Uganda. She is married and has one child. Gorretti has a business selling fish around her village in Kyotera. She has had her business for about five months.  \r\n\r\nTo expand her business, Gorretti is requesting a loan of 100,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more stock of fish, which Gorretti will then resell in town. Gorretti hopes to expand and diversify her fish-selling business, selling other types of products and generating more profits.\r\n\r\nNote to lenders: BRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product to Kiva which funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills. Afterwards, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses. These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and to improve their prospects for the future. It targets a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance organizations. Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and it gives Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and to support a promising new sector in

Salima is 16 years old and lives in the town of Kyotera, in the Masaka area of Uganda.  She is single and has no children.  Salima has a business managing a small retail shop in Kyotera.  Despite her very young age, Salima has had her business for about three years.    \r\n\r\nTo expand her business, Salima is requesting a loan of 200,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more inventory, which Salima will be able to sell at her retail shop. She hopes to create a strong business and to save profits in order to support herself in the future.    \r\n\r\nNote to lenders: BRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product to Kiva, which funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills. Afterwards, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses.  These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access financing at a young age and to improve their prospects for the future. It is targeting a segment of the population that is not typically served by traditional microfinance organizations. Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans. It gives Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and to support a promising new sector in

O. is a 54-year old married woman who supports her family by operating three business ventures: sari-sari (general) store, buys and sells herbal medicine and sells Avon products.  She lives in Sitio Quiao, Alijis, Valladolid, Negros Occidental. \r\n\r\nNelly has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2002 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts.  By working hard she is gradually making her family more economically stable.  She now earns an average income of PHP6,000 monthly. \r\n\r\nNelly is now borrowing PHP 15,000 to buy more products for her store.  This will be her 13th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon.  Her previous loan of PHP15,000, was paid off well within its term; it was another step in her journey towards economic freedom.  Nelly aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\n-----------------------------\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":558276,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\n\t\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous, and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment, forcing hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<p>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Justine is 21 years old and lives in the town of Kyotera in the Masaka area of Uganda.  She is married and has one child.  Justine has a business running a small restaurant in Kyotera.  Justine has had her business for approximately three years.\r\n\r\nTo expand her business, Justine is requesting a loan of 200,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda.  The loan will be used to buy more food stocks to use in her restaurant, and also to invest in the restaurant\u2019s upkeep.  Justine hopes to bring more clients to her restaurant, and generate greater profits for her family.  \r\n\r\nNote to lenders: BRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product to Kiva which funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.  This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills.  Afterwards, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses.  These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance.  Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in microfinance."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":559260,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"Food

Sylivia, 21, lives in the town of Kyotera in the Masaka area of Uganda.  Single with one child, for the past year-and-a half Sylivia has had a business selling arts and crafts, including decorative mats that people use to sit on.  <p>\r\n\r\nTo expand her business, Sylivia is requesting a loan of 150,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda to buy arts and crafts materials to make more mats, hoping to increase her sales to generate more profits with which to support herself and her child.  <p>\r\n\r\nNote to lenders: BRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product to Kiva which funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.  This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills. Afterwards, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses.  <p>\r\n\r\nThese loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance.  Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in

N. is 18 years old and lives in the town of Kyotera in the Masaka area of Uganda. She is single and has one child, a young boy. Allen has a business selling local juices to customers in the Kyotera area. Despite her young age, Allen has worked in this business for about three years.  \r\n\r\nTo expand her business, Allen is requesting a loan of 100,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda, a Kiva partner. The loan will be used to buy more stock of juice, which Allen can sell in the community.  Allen hopes to sell greater quantities of the juice and earn profit to support herself and her child.  \r\n\r\n<b>Note to lenders:<\/b> BRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product to Kiva which funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills. Afterward, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses. These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance. Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and to give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in microfinance.

N. is 20 years old and lives in the town of Kyotera in the Masaka area of Uganda. She is married and has one child. Sylivia has a business running a retail shop, which specializes in selling coffee. Sylivia has had this business for about two years. \r\n\r\nTo expand her business, Sylivia is requesting a loan of 200,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda, a Kiva partner. The loan will be used to buy more quantities of coffee that Sylivia can sell to customers in her community. Sylivia hopes to expand her business and possibly sell other products, and gain a greater income for her family.    \r\n\r\n<b>Note to lenders: <\/b>BRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product to Kiva which funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills. Afterward, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses. These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance. Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and to give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in microfinance.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Doloth is 21 years old and lives in the town of Kyotera in the Masaka area of Uganda. She is married and has one child. Doloth has a business running a retail shop in Kyotera. Doloth has had this business for about one year. \r\n\r\nTo expand her business, Doloth is requesting a loan of 300,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more inventory to sell at her retail shop. Doloth hopes to expand her business, generating greater profit to use for her family.  \r\n\r\n\r\nNote to lenders: BRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product to Kiva which funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills. Afterwards, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses. These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access financing at a young age and to improve their prospects for the future. The loans target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance. Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, to give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs, and to support a promising new sector in microfinance."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":559274,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Buy

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Now she is borrowing for her fourth cycle loan, the amount of Php 15,000 to support her bakery.

P. is a married woman who lives in Prk.

Her husband Jinky, who works as a Chainsaw helper, also helps his wife.  They have three children who are 16 to 18 years old. \r\n\r\nGuiluna joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1999 because she wanted something better for her family.  With the help of her past eight loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Guiluna has been lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 12,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4,000.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 9th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 14,000, which she intends to use to buy vegetables for additional stocks and for future home repairs.  Guiluna P. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n---------------------------------\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

Masinadyahon, Brgy. Maquiling, Sagay City, Negros Occidental.  She earns her living as a coconut grinder and repair & maintenance shop owner.  Her husband Erasmo, who is 70 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living.  He also helps his wife.  They have eight children who are 27 to 37 years old. \r\n\r\nErlinda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1989 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 13 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Erlinda has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 17,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4,500.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 14th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 17,000 to buy welding rods and other stock for her shop so she could continue to save up for future home repairs and education.  Erlinda B. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n---------------------------------\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

E. is from the town of Sta. Josefa. He is 55 years old, married, and has two school-aged children. He is a farmer. He has been tilling his rice field for over 22 years now. He also raises pigs. Like other fathers, he only wants the best for his family. \r\n\r\nRenato joined CEVI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and increase his ability to engage in business activities. Renato has successfully repaid his previous loans from CEVI. Renato is requesting a loan of 6000 PHP, which he will use to purchase fertilizer for his field and feed for the pigs. This is his eighth loan from CEVI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of his family. \r\n\r\nAbout CEVI:\r\n\r\nCommunity Economic Ventures, Inc (CEVI) has increased its portfolio significantly over the recent years.  Based in Bohol, it has numerous branches throughout the Philippines.  In 2009, CEVI was awarded a CGAP silver award for transparency in social performance monitoring. CEVI not only provides credit for its clients but also assists its clients with savings, insurance, and training, which are provided through regular cluster group meetings.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Because manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created a template that lets the Field Partners continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":559876,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase fertilizer for his rice field and feed for the pigs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Sta.

Asomuddin is 33 years old, married, and has four children. He is a very enterprising person.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve their agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to provide poor and low income clients with the assistance they need to develop a viable business. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

These spontaneous events make us strong, strengthen our belief in ourselves and keep us from becoming lazy. The heroes of this story are people who at the peak of unemployment, economic recession and political instability resolutely continue to do their work and step by step realize their dreams. Burulbu T. is the leader of this group. Burulbu is 57 years old. As the country was suffering from unemployment and hopeless people began to leave the country in search of work, Burulbu preferred to use the funds that she had in order to stay afloat. She has been familiar with livestock husbandry since childhood and decided that this would be her formula for success. Now she breeds cattle and sells milk. The sale of milk brings 2,800 som per month. Burulbu has five children and she never felt a lack of help. Through the joint efforts of the entire family, they built a house. Next, Burulbu successfully married her son. Not all members of the family work with the animals. Burulbu and her youngest son are involved in breeding cattle. Burulbu\u2019s husband works as a security guard at a parking lot; but in his spare time actively helps Burulbu with her work. One of her sons works at a sugar factory, while her two daughters have gone to work in Russia. The youngest son works in water management and helps his mother tend to the animals. Burulbu is requesting the loan to buy a washing machine, which has been her dream for a long time as it would lighten the load of her household chores.\r\n\r\nBurulbu\u2019s partners in the group: \r\n\r\nZhayangul S. is 25 years old. Together with her husband Zhayangul works in animal breeding and sells milk. She has a 4 year old daughter. Zhayangul hopes to get this loan to buy a refrigerator, so her milk will not spoil.\r\n\r\nArtykul T. is 53 years old. She is a widow and the mother of three children, and she is raising her grandchildren. Nevertheless, Artykul still works in animal husbandry.

With the help of his father, he started a clothing-sales business and his wife helped him. His business has grown and he wants to continue to grow in order to improve his quality of life.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

is an enterprising woman with a big desire to improve the quality of life of her family. She is married and the mother of four children. Mairamo has been a seamstress since she was very young. With a lot of effort, she has been able to open a small shop in her home and has been successful because her customers have recognized the high quality of her products. In this way, she constantly adds new clients and has seen her business grow. \r\n\r\n\r\nToday Mairamo is applying for a loan from IMON International for the second time. She is requesting a loan of 4000 Somoni to purchase new modern fabrics for sewing national dresses. You can help improve the quality of life of her family. Mairamo and her children are grateful for your generosity and support.  \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Ilhom is a lively entrepreneur with a small business selling clothing for women at the central market in Dushanbe, Tajikistan.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
