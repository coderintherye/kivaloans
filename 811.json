They have a 220 sq meter greenhouse and a plot of land. They grow cucumbers and tomatoes, which are sold locally as well as in nearby villages. The family has been involved in this business for 11 years. \r\n\r\nDuring this period, they have been working hard to expand their farm. Datuna received a good harvest of vegetables last year, which was sold for a convenient price. He already covered his first Kiva loan.

Her daughters are married and one of them lives in Russia and another one in Bishkek (the capital of Kyrgyzstan).\r\n\r\nLidiya was born in the simple family of a farmer with five children. She was independent since childhood and loved to help her mother to take care of the home. Lidiya got married right after she graduated from high school. Her husband was already working in the local collective farm at the time and after their wedding the farm had given them a house to live which they have bought out later. Lidiya has found a job in the same farm as a milkmaid. A year later in 1989 their oldest daughter was born and then in 1991 their second daughter. In search of an additional income for her family Lidiya started doing animal husbandry and used an amount  of 2,000 som (KGS) to start the business.

He is single and has one child, age 3 years. \r\n\r\nIn 2007, Sulaiman established his DVD, VCD  and television business. He began his business because he wants to enhance his independence and that is the sole source of livelihood. \r\n\r\nWorking seven days a week and 13 hours a day, he earns about SLL 1,000,000 every month from this business. \r\n\r\nHe would like a loan in the amount of SLL 4,000,000.

is 60-year-old Ya-Almamy. She is married and has 3 children, ages 38, 34 and 23 years. She has no additional dependents that live with her.  \r\n\r\nIn 1992, Ya-Almamy established her provisions business. She began her business because she did not go to school. Therefore, at the age of 20, her parents gave her for marriage to a business tycoon. As a hardworking woman, she decided to request from her husband to establish her own business and not to depend on the husband alone. Working 7 days a week and 10 hours a day, she earns about 1,050,000 SLL every month from this business. \r\n\r\nShe would like a loan in the amount of 3,000,000 SLL. Ya-Almamy requests a loan in order to buy 60 tins of blue plate mayonnaise @ 15,000, 100 tins of luncheon meat @ 9,000, and 4 bags of sugar @ 280,000.

Their total average monthly income is 100 Laris. \r\n\r\nZelimkhan has requested a loan to start up two businesses \u2013 a grocery store and a canteen in the village. The necessary furniture and equipment were purchased by Zelimkhan couple of years ago with funds he collected abroad from his hard work, but he doesn't have funds to start operating these businesses. With this loan, he will buy grocery products to sell in the store. He will work as the salesman himself. Another part of the loan will be used to buy products for his canteen. There will be three persons employed by the canteen \u2013 a cook, one waiter and one dishwasher\/cleaner. According to Zelimkhan\u2019s estimations, both businesses will be profitable and will expand in the future. \r\n\r\nZelimkhan\u2019s loan request was approved within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo.

Among the myths concerning it some say that it\u2019s a derivation originally made by an Englishman: \u201cTalca parece Londres\u201d (Talca seems like London) because of the abundant fog that frequently blankets the city in winter very much like in the United Kingdom.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1036864,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy women's clothes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CL","country":"Chile","town":"Talca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-30 -71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":157,"posted_date":"2012-03-20T17:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-19T17:00:02Z","loan_amount":4675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Myrtha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Manuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gerardo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"V\u00edctor","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Veronica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hern\u00e1n","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ester","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ingrid","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Veronica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Katherin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ingrid","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cristian","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Estela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lorena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CLP","disbursal_amount":2254509,"loan_amount":4675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":148464},{"due_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":152955},{"due_date":"2012-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":154413},{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":155889},{"due_date":"2012-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":157374},{"due_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":158877},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":160389},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":161919},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":163467},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":163881},{"due_date":"2012-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":167517},{"due_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":168192},{"due_date":"2012-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":169794},{"due_date":"2012-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":171378}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":307.86},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":317.17},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":320.19},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":323.26},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":326.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":329.45},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":332.59},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":335.76},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":338.97},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":339.82},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":347.37},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":348.77},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":352.09},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":355.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-03-21T13:34:46Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":403181,"name":"Magdalena","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Magdalena ya ha tenido cuatro cr\u00e9ditos con KIVA los cuales ha pagado puntual mente.

While in the service he noticed that many of the products that were being used were poorly made and sold to the Army for very high prices. He decided that he could help the Army by building quality, durable products that could be purchased much cheaper than from the current production facilities. \r\n\r\nGary decided to follow up on this endeavor by founding his own enterprise. His greatest success came with the development of the BiCon, a military suited shower\/latrine facility, in 2009. In 2010, he had planned to seriously market this product; however, his plans were halted when he was sent to travel  internationally for long spans with his full-time job.

To make peanut paste, the best peanuts must first be separated, then roasted and peeled.  After removing the skins, the peanuts are ground.  The resulting paste is sold on a retail basis for cash or credit to a customer base made up mainly of women.  With this loan, Mrs. Fatoumata hopes to make an average monthly profit of 20,000 FCFA, which she will use to reinvest in her business and take care of urgent household expenses.
