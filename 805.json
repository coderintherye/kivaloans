In the Philippines, the whole working community and most families only eat home-cooked meals during the evening when all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a normal family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to use gas to cook food for one or two people when buying cooked rice and viands costs less than raw food. Bernadette's regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy more quantities of products like meat, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasoning. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nBernadette hopes to grow her business and dreams of being able to give her family a good future through all her hard work in her business.

All are enrolled in school. His wife works as a farmer. He has been a rice farmer for nine years. He would like to get this Kiva loan to buy fertilizers and seeds and to pay for support labor to get the best harvest. With the profits, he plans to expand the area he has been using to get a larger output and a nice house. In the background of the picture, other agriculture borrowers are looking on as the photo is being taken.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nJoan operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings where all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands cost less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 15,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nJoan hopes to grow her business into a restaurant in her area and dreams of being able to give her child a good and high quality education through all her hard work in her business.

He has been a rice farmer for 2 years. He would like to get this Kiva loan to buy fertilizers, seeds, and support labor to get the best harvest. With the profits, he plans to expand the area he has been using to get more output. Behind him in the picture, other agriculture borrowers are shown sitting down, waiting for their turn to get photos too. \r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

He started this business 15 years ago when he was working in a cabinetmaking shop.  Since he really enjoyed this trade, he had the idea of studying architecture, and so he began to improve his work.  Over time, he became quite well-known, and so he decided to start working independently in his own home.  He started up his own business in a workshop, gradually buying the tools and equipment he needed.  His workshop has done very well, and he has a lot of expansion plans, but he lacks sufficient working capital to implement these plans as quickly as he would like.  This is the reason that he came to seek a Kiva loan.  This will be his first loan from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, and with it he will buy supplies and raw materials so that he can make some new designs, such as wood, paint, lacquer, glue, tacks and screws, and he will also invest some of the money in making some improvements to his workshop.  He will put in new wood flooring and will also add a roof that will allow him to work in better conditions, especially during the rainy season.  His goal for the future is to make his important purchases in bulk so he can obtain a good discount.  To do this, he will prepare to participate in each loan cycle offered by this institution."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1020248,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture Making","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"to buy wood, paint, lacquer, glue, tacks and screws, and also to make some small improvements to his workshop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Cartagena de Indias","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-03-12T00:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-11T00:50:02Z","loan_amount":1150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Edwin  ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":2000000,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":86013},{"due_date":"2012-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":92686},{"due_date":"2012-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":94849},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":97062},{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":99327},{"due_date":"2012-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":101645},{"due_date":"2012-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":104016},{"due_date":"2012-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":106443},{"due_date":"2012-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":108927},{"due_date":"2012-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":111469},{"due_date":"2013-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":114070},{"due_date":"2013-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":116731},{"due_date":"2013-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":119455},{"due_date":"2013-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":122242},{"due_date":"2013-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":125094},{"due_date":"2013-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":128013},{"due_date":"2013-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":131000},{"due_date":"2013-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":140958}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.46},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.29},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.54},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.81},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.11},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.81},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.2},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.64},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.09},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.59},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.12},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.69},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.29},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.93},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.6},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.05}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-03-15T21:22:34Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":401295,"name":"Edwin Wanyoike Njoki","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Edwin is 27 years old, he runs a butcher shop to earn a living.

She hopes to one day grow her business large enough to purchase a vehicle to aid in transporting bottles. Her business strategy is to stock a large variety of drinks. She feels this has helped her acquire many customers. \r\n\r\nMatilde has received three previous loans from Kiva's partner HOPE Congo. She has a very good repayment record.

The agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.
