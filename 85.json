Huancavelica is considered one of the poorest regions of Peru and has many limitations being a very mountainous area (altitude ranges from 6,000 \u2013 17,000 ft above sea level), the cold, the difficulty to grow crops and the lack of an adequate infrastructure of roads and communication systems.\r\n<p>\r\nBCR \u201cMicaela Bastidas\u201d is located the community of Choclococha in the district of the same name, province of Acobamba. The main activities of the population are the growth of corn and potatoes and most of the population also is dedicated to raising bulls, cows, sheep and smaller cattle. \r\n<p>\r\nThe bank has been formed recently with 11 female borrowers and therefore has no history yet. It has only just started to create history in its community! The expectations working with FINCA Peru are very clear: increase business and save. For all members, the main use of the savings they will be generating as of now is for investing in their businesses or for the education of their children, whether to buy school uniforms, supplies, books or paying the fee for entering primary or secondary school.  \r\n<p>\r\nMost women have small businesses that require small loans; therefore, almost all members have a 200 soles loan, with the exception of two women, who each have loans of 500 soles. The total of the loans is 2,900 soles among the 11 members.\r\n<p>\r\nOne of the group\u00b4s members, Tomasa L. Auccapi\u00f1a, sells bread at the local markets. Another small business she runs is a small flour mill for wheat and other cereals. With her 200 soles loan she will be able to buy more supplies for her small store. When asked about her future, she says that her dream is the education of her children so they can be professionals and keep studying. And another dream is for her store to grow so that she will be able to move to a bigger city to run a bigger store there. With her (future) savings, she will buy more merchandise for her store. Already she has learned to be more nice in her store, to treat clients well, and to be more hygienic. She also learned about the importance of saving.\r\n<p>\r\nMarina M. C. has another story. She has a small oven to make bread. She sells the bread at local markets and sometimes in town, in her small grocery-store where she also sells fruits.  With her loan of 200 soles she will be able to buy more supplies for her business. Her dream for the future is simply to live a good life with her family and her children. She will use her savings to buy more merchandise, sell more, and then save more. Her expectations working with FINCA Peru are to learn to work harder and be more responsible."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":142713,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"Buy new supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2008-03-29T03:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Paulina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luzmila Vicitacion","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosalina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Norma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Daria Santa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jeaneth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adalberta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tomasa Maxima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-04-12T18:35:16Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2900,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":483.33},{"due_date":"2008-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":483.33},{"due_date":"2008-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":483.33},{"due_date":"2008-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":483.33},{"due_date":"2008-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":483.33},{"due_date":"2008-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":483.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":175,"local_amount":483.33,"processed_date":"2008-05-12T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T03:52:57Z","rounded_local_amount":490.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":208437,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":175,"local_amount":483.33,"processed_date":"2008-06-12T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T03:54:17Z","rounded_local_amount":490.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":236433,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":175,"local_amount":483.33,"processed_date":"2008-07-12T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T04:01:27Z","rounded_local_amount":490.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":265210,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":175,"local_amount":483.33,"processed_date":"2008-08-12T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T04:04:14Z","rounded_local_amount":490.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294159,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":175,"local_amount":483.33,"processed_date":"2008-09-12T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-18T07:11:45Z","rounded_local_amount":490.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":324679,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":175,"local_amount":483.33,"processed_date":"2008-10-12T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-15T07:10:04Z","rounded_local_amount":490.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":357152,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2008-03-29T18:35:16Z","paid_date":"2008-10-15T07:10:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":42157,"name":"Amador","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Amador is a butcher and he has an established post in the market in the city of La Merced.

M. lives in the town of Yavan.

She has a small farm where she keeps goats and calves. But Buburoziya wants to buy a cow so that  she can get fresh milk. During the spring and summer months it's very simple to feed the cattle because fodder is widely available, but she does not have the money.

K. lives in the town of Yavan. He is 37 years old, married and has five children. He has secondary education. He does not have a job, but makes his living by animal husbandry. He has a small cow house where he breeds calves and small cattle which he sells after feeding. This brings in a good income for his family. Djamshed has been in this business for the past ten years. Right now the prices for cattle are a little bit lower so he wants to buy a few goats and sheep. He needs additional money and this is why he applied for a loan. He will be able to increase the number of heads of cattle which in turn will increase his profits from sales. He plans to pay off the loan within 10 months.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Elena Fedorchuk, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\u041a\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0445\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0432

Zuhurovna E. lives in the town of Yavan. She is 44 years old, married with six children. She has secondary education and is a housewife. She has a small farm which she keeps by herself. She has a few calves, which she feeds and sells, but she needs one milk cow. She wants to buy a cow to supply her family with milk and sell the remainder to neighbors. This will give her family fresh milk and milk products and give her additional income, as well as let the neighbors who don't have cows buy milk at an affordable price. This is her dream at this time. Kurbongul needs the loan so she can be able to buy a cow. She plans to pay off the loan within 10 months.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Elena Fedorchuk, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\u042d\u043b\u0431\u0435\u0433\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430

Holikulovich G. lives in the Rudaki region. He is 37 years old, married and has four children. He has secondary education. He does not have a job, but he has his own business - animal husbandry. He has several calves which he feeds and resells. After that he buys young calves and after feeding them for 40-45 days resells again on the same markets. He has a cow house where he keeps them and has been in this business for four years.<p>\r\nAnimal husbandry is one of the main types of business in the rural areas. The season of buying and selling of calves is here and Djurabek wants to buy another calve. It will help him increase commodity turnover and receive additional income. He does not have enough money and decided to apply for a loan. He plans to pay off the loan within 12 months.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Elena Fedorchuk, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\u0413\u0443\u043b\u044c\u043c\u0438\u0440\u0437\u043e\u0435\u0432

B. lives in the region of Rudaki. He is 34 years old, married and has 2 children. Sheraly graduated from high school; he does not work anywhere. The only source of income for his family is an animal rearing business, which works out well in the rural area. Sheraly has a small cow barn where he grows calfs for sale. He purchases young animals on local markets, takes care of them for about 40-45 days, when animals get bigger he sells them on the same markets. Now is the season of animal trading, therefore the client needs additional help. He needs additional money, and this is why he came to us in order to obtain a loan. Additional resources will help him not only to purchase more animals, but also to receive profit, which he needs. This will help his family to have a little bit of a better life. The client plans to repay the loan within 12 months. <p><b>Translated from Russian by Anna Startseva, Kiva volunteer.<b><p>\u0411\u043e\u0431\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043b\u043e\u0432

H. lives in the region called Abdurahmon Jomi. He is 31 years old and married. He graduated from high school. Ahmad has an agricultural business, he has a plot of land where he plants wheat. This is Ahmad's main activity and the principle source of income for his family. After the harvest he leaves a part of the crops for the family and he sells the rest.  Ahmad has been in this business for 5 years. Now is the time to sow, therefore the client needs a loan to purchase wheat seeds in order to obtain a quality harvest. This will help add new clients and sell all his crops. The client plans to repay the loan within 12 months. <p><b>Translated from Russian by Anna Startseva, Kiva volunteer.<b><p>\r\n\r\n\u0425\u0430\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0432 \u0410\u0445\u043c\u0430\u0434

K. lives in the city of Yavan. He is 41 years old, is married and has 6 children. He has a  degree in teaching. He works in a High School in Yavan. His salary is however too small to provide for his family and he is forced to have a business on the side. He is a very optimistic person and supplements his measly salary by raising cattle. The profit from this business provides the necessary additional income that allows him to provide for his family. Currently the prices of animals have gone slightly down and it would be beneficial to his business to purchase calves now. This will allow Djurabek to increase turnover, get more profit from the business and take better care of his family. The business also contributes to the development of cattle raising in the region. This is why the client has come to Kiva for a loan. He plans to repay the loan within a 9 months period. \r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Jane Mazur, Kiva volunteer<\/b><\/p>\r\n\r\n\u041a\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0445\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0432

She is 53 years old, is married and has 5 children. She has a degree in Accounting. She works as an accountant at the local court. Because the pay is relatively small she is also in the business of raising cattle on the side. When the animals are grown, she sells them on the market. Currently the prices for animals have dropped and it would be a perfect opportunity to purchase a milk cow. This will allow her to provide her own family with milk and milk products. If there will be a lot of milk, she will be able to sell milk and milk products to her neighbors. Gulisor has come to Kiva to obtain a loan that will allow her to purchase the cow. Her family will help her take care of the animal.

He is 22 years old and single. Although he is not married, he is part of a large family. His father and him both work to provide for their big happy family. Each of them has their own business. Fahriddin is in the business of raising cattle. When the cattle is grown, he sells the calves on the market. He has been in this business for the past 2 years. Currently the prices for the animals have slightly dropped and it provides a perfect opportunity to increase turnover of the business. The profit from the business will increase and help Fahriddin take better care of his family. In addition to that the business helps the development of cattle raising in the region. This is why Fahriddin has come to Kiva for a loan. He plans to repay the loan within a 12 months period. His family and friends will make sure that he is able to do so.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Jane Mazur, Kiva volunteer<\/b><\/p>\r\n\r\n\u0410\u043d\u0430\u0435\u0432

He is the sixth son among 9 brothers and sisters, and in 2004 he moved to Ponta D\u2019Ouro following 4 of his siblings. Ponta D\u2019Ouro is a beach village on the border with South Africa, very famous for its tourism, especially among South Africans. <P>\r\nJose completed primary school (up to 7th grade) and since 2005 is a waiter in one of Ponta D\u2019Ouro\u2019s great restaurants (Kaya Kweru). His initial salary was MTn 1,500\/ month, but since last year it was increased to MTn 2,000\/month (around US$80). He works 8 hours per day, from 7am to 3pm or from 3pm to 10pm, six days per week.<P>\r\nJose got married 2 years ago, and although his wife Cassilda (20 years old) is now working, they are barely able to save any money in the end of the month. As Jose is a very family-oriented person, he goes personally to Maputo once a month to bring his family money (MTn 1,000) and salute his mother. He pays MTn300 back and forth to Maputo, so in fact he just gives MTn 700 to his parents. <P>\r\nJose heard about Hluvuku at work, and after seeing a friend repaying his loan, he decided to apply for his first loan ever to improve his living conditions. Today Jose lives in a house with a plastic roof, and with this MTn 3,000 loan he will be able to buy aluminum roofing in South Africa and stop heavy rain from entering the house.<P>\r\nAs soon as Jose finishes repaying this first loan, he intends to apply for a second one in order to go to driver\u2019s school and get his license. The school takes 1 month and costs MTn 6,000. Jose believes that he can earn significantly more as a driver (the driver of the restaurant he works for, for example, earns 3 times more than he does). He is a very motivated young man and has many plans, such as building his own brick house and having his own restaurant.<P>\r\nThe picture shows Jose with one of his nieces, Edna, at his house."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":142899,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"Buy construction material (aluminum roofing)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Ponta D'Ouro","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-18.25 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":"2008-03-30T18:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jose Bernardo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-04-13T18:56:55Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2008-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2008-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2008-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2008-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2008-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2008-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":15,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2008-04-30T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T05:12:32Z","rounded_local_amount":354,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196155,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":15,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2008-05-31T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T05:12:58Z","rounded_local_amount":354,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":223900,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":15,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2008-06-30T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T05:13:28Z","rounded_local_amount":354,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":252534,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":15,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2008-07-31T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T05:14:26Z","rounded_local_amount":354,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":281940,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":15,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2008-08-31T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-09T02:06:34Z","rounded_local_amount":354,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":311965,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":15,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2008-09-30T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-01T07:22:40Z","rounded_local_amount":354,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":342176,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":15,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T05:53:09Z","rounded_local_amount":354,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5322551,"comment":null},{"amount":15,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2008-12-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T23:12:18Z","rounded_local_amount":354,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9941724,"comment":null},{"amount":15,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-20T09:02:47Z","rounded_local_amount":354,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14865334,"comment":null},{"amount":15,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-03T08:20:56Z","rounded_local_amount":354,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20407579,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-03-30T18:56:55Z","paid_date":"2009-04-03T08:20:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":42253,"name":"Elidio","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elidio is 25 years old and is originally from Ponta Malongane, a beach 20km north of Ponta D\u2019Ouro, where he currently lives. Ponta D\u2019Ouro is also a beach village, but on the border of South Africa and very famous for its tourism. Elidio and his family moved to South Africa for 10 years during the Mozambican civil war, returning home in 1993.<P>\r\n\r\nElidio didn\u2019t complete primary school. He studied up to 5th grade and left to find a job and take care of his newly born daughter, who is today 5 years old. He is married and just had a new baby boy a month ago.

There are no public hospitals or clinics and food is very expensive. Elidio prefers to pay the 20 rand (around US$2) transportation costs and shop in Manguza in South Africa every other week (or at least once a month). Last month he sent his wife to Maputo (the capital) to have his baby, all increments to his monthly expenses.<P>\r\n\r\nThis is Elidio\u2019s second loan with Hluvuku. He used the first loan of MTn 3,000 to buy bricks and cement to start his own house. He was able to complete repayment in advance and has applied for this second loan of MTn 5,000 to buy aluminum covering to use on the roof. As soon as Elidio finishes paying this second loan, he intends to apply for a third one to continue building his house. All he is missing now are the floor and some other details in order to move there.

The oldest boy started school this year, although Mozambican law changed the initial school age to 7 years old. Joao and his family moved to Ponta D\u2019Ouro in 2002 searching for work opportunities. Ponta D\u2019Ouro is a beach village on the border with South Africa, very famous for its tourism, especially among South Africans.<P>\r\n\r\nIn 2005 Joao was able to open a grocery shop at the Mercado Central (the open-air central market) with MTn 7,000. He sells mainly food and basic products. Wheat is his most famous product: 1Kg is sold for MTn 25. Sodas are also products that sell a lot, especially South African brands that he brings from there. A 2L bottle costs MTn 70 and the small one costs MTn 15. Joao goes to South Africa every time he manages to save (and buy) Rand, normally once or twice per month. He pays R60 (around US$6) for transportation and he buys all his inventory and also food and clothes for his family. <P>\r\n\r\nWith this shop, Joao makes between MTn 1,500 and MTn 2,500, depending on the tourist season. During high season (summer time), he also works as a temporary employee in the camping site, washing dishes or helping with the tourists. His wife stays at the grocery shop and they are able to almost double ther monthly income, so they are able to save for winter months.\r\n<P>\r\nThis is Joao\u2019s first loan with Hluvuku. He decided to apply after seeing a few colleagues succeeding in life with Hluvuku loans. This MTN 5,000 will be used to increase his inventory for the holidays. He believes sales will increase significantly and he will be able to repay the loan very fast. In the future, Joao intends to apply for a second loan to open a new shop, where he will work full-time in summer and winter as

is 27 years old and is originally from the north of Mozambique. His family moved to Ponta D\u2019Ouro 13 years ago, and today only his father and an uncle lives here, the rest of the family is in Maputo (the capital). Ponta D\u2019Ouro is a beach village in the boarder with South Africa, very famous for its tourism, especially among South Africans. Married, Alexandre has a 2 years old daughter. He also helps to support his 2 younger brothers that are still in school. He has another younger brother that is working in South Africa. \r\n\r\nAlexandre studied until 6th grade (only 7th grade missing to finish primary school) and worked as a construction worker for almost 7 years. Soon after, he got a job as a gardener at Ponta D\u2019Ouro campsite, where he worked for 5 years earning MTN 1,200 monthly until January 2008. He decided to resign to focus in what he really likes to be: a photographer. Alexandre charges R15 (~US$1) for a regular size photo and between R50 and R100 (around US$5-10) for posters. He goes to Maputo every week to develop all pictures, paying MTn 300 (around US$15) for both ways transportation. With this business, Alexandre makes approximately MTn 3,500 per month. On top of that, Alexandre has 4 rooms that he rents, making up to MTn 1,500 per month, and still does some construction work when asked. \r\n\r\nThis is Alexandre\u2019s first loan with Hluvuku. This MTN 5,000 was used to build a grocery shop next to his house. He lives in a distant part of Ponta D\u2019Ouro, and believes all his neighbors will use his shop. At this first step, he will sell food and basic products. His wife will work at the shop, from 7am to 6pm daily, and will be able to continue to take care of the house. In the future, Alexandre dreams with a second Hluvuku loan to bring electricity to his shop, buy a fridge and start selling drinks (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic) and meat.

is a lively and beautiful 21-year-old woman, originally from Maputo. Soon after she finished primary school, in 2003, she moved to Ponta D\u2019Ouro to work. Ponta D\u2019Ouro is a beach village on the border with South Africa, very famous for its tourism, especially among South Africans. <P>\r\n\r\nRacia has 2 daughters: Beluxa who is 3 years old and Jessica, 6 months old. She was married for 3 years and recently went through a divorce; her ex-husband left her soon after she returned with Jessica after a month in South Africa (the baby got sick and there are no hospitals in Ponta). Beluxa is currently living with her mother-in-law in Maputo, and Racia visits her whenever possible (roughly once a month).<P>\r\n\r\nRacia has been working as a cleaning lady at the same house since 2003. Her bosses are South Africans and have 2 houses in Ponta, one where they live and other to rent for tourists. Racia cleans both houses, does some laundry and other things when asked. She had her monthly salary raised from R250 in 2003 to current R900 (around US$ 80) and also learnt how to speak English. Racia works at the houses from 8am to 1pm daily, and leaves Jessica with her neighbor, paying her R200 per month to look after the baby. As food is too expensive in Ponta, Racia gives half of her monthly salary to her bosses, who bring food and clothes from South Africa. They are also helping with the baby expenses after Racia\u2019s husband left her. In the summer and during holidays, Racia works with tourists and is able to increase her monthly income significantly, especially because of the tips.<P>\r\n\r\nThis is Racia\u2019s second loan with Hluvuku. The first loan of MTn 5,000 she used to build the walls of her house. She repaid the loan in advance and was able to apply for this second loan of MTn 6,000. She wants to build a new house in a quieter place, as the neighborhood where she is currently living is too noisy and she doesn\u2019t feel safe by herself. She already started buying some construction materials, and with this loan she will be able to buy the rest and potentially start construction. Soon after the house is built, Racia wants to rent out her current house to increase her income.<P>\r\n\r\nIn the future, Racia intends to apply for a third loan to finish building her house and to buy a fridge.

He began his education in 1988 at a local school and finished 12th grade in 2005.  The following year his father informed him that he was financially unable to continue with the cost of his college studies now that he was also paying for school for his younger siblings.

With HLUVUKU beginning operations in 2007 he submitted a request for financing to purchase chickens to enlarge his business.  He says that he had success and that is the reason he is submitting a second loan request for 25,000MT for the same purpose.

So, in 2005, Filomena joined SPBD, and borrowed $300 to restart her parent\u2019s plantation. Her business was improving slowly month-by-month, until her father passed away. After her father's death, Filomena paid back her 300 loan and stopped working on the plantation. For a period of time, she relied on her husband's salary for supporting her family. Now her children are ready to start schooling, but she can\u2019t afford to send them to school. That is why Filomena wishes to restart her plantation business. She is requesting a loan of $500 for this purpose."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":142996,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase

She was having some health issues so she could not work on tasks that require force. She has 3 children and 2 of them had suddenly developed illness which had left sequela. So everything is relied on her husband, Mr Li\u00ean, who works on their small piece of land so things are very difficult for the family. She then joined TYM and got a loan which she used to buy goods from H. Noi city then to resell. Everyday her husband would go to every hamlet in the village to sell the goods. After a while, someone she knows teaches her how to make those paper horses and other religious objects made with paper and bamboo that people would burn as offerings in religious ceremony. So she learned the trade since it is not a forceful task. She applied for a loan and started this business. She had since then obtained numerous loans totaling in the thousands usd. This had turned her life around, things have really improved for her family. She has a lot of customers especially during the end of the year (when there are a lot of ceremonies). Her income is 200-220 USD a month. This time she is requesting a loan of 1200 USD to buy material (paper, bamboo).\r\n\r\n<P><B>Translated from Vietnamese by Khang Ho-Si, Kiva volunteer.<P><\/b>\r\n\r\nHo\u00e0n c\u1ea3nh gia \u0111inh ch\u1ecb Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb H\u00e0, 39 tu\u1ed5i, tr\u01b0\u1edbc khi tham gia v\u00e0o Qu\u1ef9 r\u1ea5t kh\u00f3 kh\u0103n v\u1ec1 c\u1ea3 v\u1eadt ch\u1ea5t l\u1eabn tinh th\u1ea7n.

This region is sided by the river so there is not much land for cultivation. So it was not easy just to rely on the land to provide the income. In the beginning, Mrs T\u01b0\u01a1i received 70 USD as the first loan. She used this money to raise pigs. After one year, considering that it was a success, she had applied for bigger loans. She has invested in farming fishes and pigs. Her installation is large scale. Today she has a 4\/10 acre fish pond, 1 dozen of pigs, vegetables and fruit plants. After 5 years with TYM, her family living condition has improved considerably and so did a lot of other families in the region. This time she is requesting a loan of 1200 USD to buy breeding pigs, fishes and food for the animals. Mrs T\u01b0\u01a1i lives with her husband and 2 of their 3 children, the oldest one is working in Ha Noi city.\r\n\r\n<P><B>Translated from Vietnamese by Khang Ho-Si, Kiva volunteer.<P><\/b>\r\n\r\nTh\u00e1ng 5 n\u0103m 2002, khi Qu\u1ef9 T\u00ecnh th\u01b0\u01a1ng m\u1edf r\u1ed9ng v\u1ec1 th\u00f4n, ph\u1ea7n \u0111\u00f4ng gia \u0111\u00ecnh c\u00e1c th\u00e0nh vi\u00ean n\u00f3i chung v\u00e0 gia \u0111\u00ecnh ch\u1ecb Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb T\u01b0\u01a1i, 39 tu\u1ed5i, n\u00f3i ri\u00eang thu\u1ed9c v\u00e0o di\u1ec7n kh\u00f3 kh\u0103n.

She had a business plan and she was quite certain to success.After much discussion with her husband, they had decided to invest in fish farming which would yield high profit. Beside that they also cultivated vegetables (1\/2 acre), planted 100 grapefruit plats and built a pig pen to raise pigs. After numerous rounds of loans, they have riped fruit from their hard work. They have overcome poverty. Now they are living comfortably. They manage their farm following the VAC process. Their annual income is 2000-2500 USD.

But we would like to draw more profit from the our catch by processing it ourselves, then re-selling it to wholesalers who come to the villages along our bay to stock up on seafood. In this fashion, we will be better able to help support our families' daily needs. <P><B>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva volunteer<P><\/b> Notre groupe a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de faire du commerce de produits halieutiques transform\u00e9s  et de la vente de     \r\n\r\npoissons frais.

Little by little, she has been able to earn enough to support her young children and has been able to work in a way where she doesn't have to leave them alone.<p>\r\n\r\nShe needs a loan of $250 that she will pay back in three months.  The money from the loan will be used to buy a portion of material at wholesale so she can continue to be able to support her children.  With your help, this will be possible.<p>\r\n\r\n<b>Translated from Spanish by Kim Baker, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nLucy K. a ra\u00edz de su divorcio tuvo problemas econ\u00f3micos para sacar adelante a sus 2 hijos, una ni\u00f1a de 9 a\u00f1os y ni\u00f1o de 6 a\u00f1os, como no pod\u00eda dejarlos solos  puesto que eran muy chicos, hace 3  a\u00f1os decidi\u00f3 dedicarse a la costura negocio que poco a poco le ha tra\u00eddo beneficios econ\u00f3micos que le permiten mantener a sus peque\u00f1os y as\u00ed no tiene que dejar a sus hijos solos. \r\n\r\n<p>\r\nElla necesita un cr\u00e9dito por US $ 250 que pagara en 3 meses para adquirir un lote de tela a precio de mayoreo y poder sacar adelante a sus hijos.

As a group, these women are very responsible in paying their fees and in saving.<p>\r\nThe loan that each one of these women will receive will be used to invest in their businesses by purchasing goods such as sugar, milk, canned goods, soft drinks and the purchase of ingredients to make meals, such as meat, vegetables, fruits and also for the purchase of recycling goods such as glass bottles, plastics and paper. <p> <b>Translated from Spanish by Cindy M., Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\r\nEste comit\u00e9 se encuentra actualmente en su quinto  ciclo del programa \u201ccomit\u00e9 de mujeres emprendedoras\u201d cuyo objetivo es lograr que todas unidas puedan trabajar en sus oficios, obtener buenas ventas y mayores ingresos, capacitaci\u00f3n para poder vender m\u00e1s y para ahorrar dinero, adem\u00e1s de fomentar la solidaridad y emprendedurismo de las mujeres paraguayas.<p>\r\n\r\nEsta conformado por 15 mujeres, de las cuales 10 son las que forman parte del grupo desde sus inicios.

Her husband helps her in the activities of the cultivation of potatoes.  Likewise, he collaborates with the care of the children.  Marcela has been dedicated to this activity for a very long time along with her husband.  She possesses 10 pack donkeys with which she transports the product.  Also she owns the lands where she cultivates the potatoes.  When there is no crop (for some reason), she purchases and then re-sells the product.  Marcela has some competition, since the zone where she cultivates is traditional for the cultivation of potatoes.  Nevertheless she has been capable of gaining a stable portion of the market for potatoes.  With the credit she requests, she will buy potatoes (capital for operations) at the market price.  Nevertheless as she has gained enough experience in this area, she has been able to obtain better prices for this activity.  The present loan is her fifth.  The previous loans were paid in a normal manner, although it should be mentioned that the client had some payments behind schedule due to problems related to the sowing of the potatoes.   \r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by B, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nMarcela de 34 a\u00f1os de edad se dedica al comercio por menor de papa CHAPISIRKA mima que produce y posteriormente vende.

The group started after some initial informational meetings in the home Ninfa V\u00e1zquez, who learned of the program from a cousin who's a member in another group. Thanks to the meetings, the women started to mobilize and soon they were able to form a group of 15, the minimum requisite number.

But as time went on their relationship strengthened, and today one of the characteristics of the group is the harmony and mutual respect they have for each other. She considers the group's success comes from the fact that each member must meet the objectives as an individual and as a group. <p>\r\nAmong the activities that these women participate in are: selling plants, selling crafts, a convenience store, a kiosk, selling clothes, and the majority are dedicated to selling \"chipas\" \u2014 a very popular traditional dish in Paraguay.

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"\u201cAnta\u201d is a small rural community bank of FINCA Peru\u2019s Wari-project which provides its credit with education services in the rural areas of Huancavelica. Huancavelica is considered one of the poorest regions of Peru and has many limitations being a very mountainous area (altituD. ranges from 2,000 \u2013 5,000 meters above sea level), the cold, the difficulty to grow crops and the lack of an adequate infrastructure of roads and communication systems.\r\n<p>\r\nBCR \u201cAnta\u201d, is located at approximately 3,400 meters above sea level, in the community with the same name in the province of Acobamba. The main activities of the population are the growth of corn (lower altitudes), potatoes and wheat (higher altitudes), and people also have cows, bulls and sheep. In the small town the people have shops and proviD. several services. Currently the bank has completed its first loan cycle. The bank is just six months old with 10 female borrowers currently and a total loan of 4,400 soles (about $1,575 US). The loans range from 200 to 800 soles. The group was able to save over 2,100 soles (about $750 US) in the first loan cycle and will continue to save in the future.\r\n<p>\r\nMost members, during their first cycle, learned to do business. Previously most production was for auto-consumption, but more and more they have learned to do business and earn a little money with the work they do.  Other very important things they learned are to save and to be responsible. With their savings they hope for their children to study and to be professionals.\r\n<p>\r\nOne of the members of the community bank is Mar\u00eda Dorotea C. B.. Mar\u00eda buys sheep and sells them at local markets. With her 200 soles loan, she will buy more sheep and sell them. Sometimes she kills one of the sheep to sell the meat. Like most people in the area, she grows peas, barley, beans and corn her in a small field, but mostly for consumption by her family. In the first cycle she managed to save some money which she can use to buy school supplies now that school is starting again. She has learned in FINCA Per\u00fa to save and has received good advice about how to live in harmony with her family. Her dream for the future is to have all her children studying in five years, to have a bigger business, and to gain more experience.\r\n<p>\r\nEuforsinia P. S. is another member of the bank who has a business buying fruits in boxes that trucks bring all the way from Huancayo, one of the mayor cities in the central Andes. Euforsinia sells the fruit at local markets. Another business she runs is buying and selling pigs, guinea-pigs and sheep.

The majority of the members work in the production and street sale of chipas (a typical Paraguayan dish made with eggs, cheese, and corn starch), other group members sell clothing, home-made candy, and groceries.  They are currently in the 7th cycle of the Entrepreneurial Women program and manage an average line of credit per person of ~$199. <p>\r\n\r\nThe committee\u2019s first meetings were in Mrs. Dora C.\u2019s home, who was the first to find out about the program and gathered her hard-working neighbors to propose that they work together as a committee.  She rounded up 15 very entrepreneurial women, each with a lot of desire to progress.  <p>\r\n\r\nSince the formation of the group, they have worked very hard and have punctually paid off each of their previous loans.  There have been no problems or arguments amongst group members, rather, each day they are more united and work as a team.  They support each other a lot, and one of the norms they\u2019ve adopted as a group is buying their goods wholesale in order to get better prices and discounts in their purchases. <p>\r\n\r\nMaria G., the committee president, states that they have learned a lot with this program since, more than just receiving a loan, they have received training in matters of public relations, self-esteem, business administration, and marketing among others. <p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by Scott Crandall, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nEl comit\u00e9 est\u00e1 integrado por 15 se\u00f1oras trabajadoras del barrio Kennedy de la ciudad de Caacup\u00e9, la gran mayor\u00eda de las integrantes de este comit\u00e9 se dedican a la elaboraci\u00f3n y venta de chipas (comida t\u00edpica paraguaya muy consumida, esta hecha a base de huevos, queso y almid\u00f3n) en forma ambulante, otras se dedican a la venta de ropas, dulces caseros y despensa.

capital.  She specializes in fruit salads as they are very popular for dessert in Paraguay.  The high temperatures in this country make a refreshing fruit salad a most appetizing option after a meal.<p>\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda begins her day in the early hours of the day, traveling to the municipal market to purchase the fruits necessary to prepare her fruit salads.  She also purchases the necessary plastic spoons and cups to serve her product.  Then she travels to the city center, where she sets up her stall daily in a street corner.  Her clientele is made up primarily of office workers from the vicinity.  She is well known and loved.<p>\r\n\r\nHer sales day ends at 6 p.m., and after taking down her stall and traveling home she begins her role as wife and mother.  Mar\u00eda is a mother of six, her children study and also take care of a fruit salad salad stand at home.  Her children love their mother and to help increase the family income they also prepare and sell the fruit salad at home.<p> \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda is one of the many Paraguayan women that sacrifice her days from sunrise to sunset to feed her children and provide an education for them.  She is requesting a micro loan to invest in a greater variaty of fruit.  With more variety, she will be able to sell fruit juices as well as her fruit salads.  Her clients have allready expressed an interest in being able to buy fruit juices from her.<p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Henry Corral, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":144001,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"Fruit purchase","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PY","country":"Paraguay","town":"Asunci\u00f3n","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-22.993333 -57.996389","type":"point"}},"partner_id":58,"posted_date":"2008-04-04T15:50:39Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria De Jesus","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-04-18T17:32:35Z","disbursal_currency":"PYG","disbursal_amount":1000000,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2008-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2008-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2008-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2008-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":200000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":45,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2008-05-07T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T05:11:26Z","rounded_local_amount":205566.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":203527,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":45,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2008-06-07T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T05:14:24Z","rounded_local_amount":205566.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":230769,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":45,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2008-07-07T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T05:18:26Z","rounded_local_amount":205566.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":259855,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":45,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2008-08-07T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T05:31:03Z","rounded_local_amount":205566.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":288672,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":45,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2008-09-07T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-09T02:00:06Z","rounded_local_amount":205566.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":318957,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2008-04-04T17:32:35Z","paid_date":"2008-09-09T02:00:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":42456,"name":"Ever Franz","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Ever is 34 years old and has an internet cafe \/ calling center near Gabriel Rene Moreno University.<p>\r\n\r\nEver lives with his two children on his own, as his wife left the country a long time ago to find employment.<p>\r\n\r\nHis business is quite busy as it is located very close to the university and a lot of students use his premises.

Her location is very good, because there is never a shortage of clients.  Plus, her husband has been contributing for various years while working at the company Sobolma Ltd.<P>There is competition, now that there are other businesses working in the same market, but since bread is a staple of the people there is sufficient demand.  On top of that, Felicita has many regular clients.<P>This credit will be for the purchase of a sewing machine that costs 170usd, and with the rest flower, sugar, lard, and jars.

The two youngest children, on the other hand, still live at home and help them with the business. <p>\r\n\r\nRicardo tells us that previously he used to work at an oil factory that later went bankrupt. Due to this turn of events he decided to find a different way to earn a living and this is how he got started selling charcoal and firewood.<p>\r\n\r\nThanks to his efforts he was able to support his family and help them get ahead. Additionally he was able to enjoy the comforts of owning his house and a truck that he now uses to deliver his products. <p>\r\n\r\nRicardo proudly mentions that he is doing well in his business and that he can count on the constant support of his family. The loan he is requesting will be used to purchase charcoal and firewood for him to sell. <p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Libertad Leal, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRicardo tiene 56 a\u00f1os, est\u00e1 casado hace 34 a\u00f1os con Prisciliana de 55 a\u00f1os.

The Friendship Bridge is very proud to have this group in their team.<P>When I entered the house of Do\u00f1a Zoila A., our meeting place, I noticed that this group was very mixed.  There were a combination of Indigenous and Ladina (Indigenous and Spanish) women.  This combination gives the group a very special characteristic since each member brings different aspects from their cultures.  Not only that, but there are many types of businesses that these women are doing.  In this group, we will find women who will use their loan to raise animals, to purchase inventory for convenience stores, beauty salons, to sell pork meat, to sell hot dogs and refreshments and to run a funeral parlour.  Due to the variety of businesses, there is also a variety of personalities in this group such as women who are strong, brave, conservative, extroverts or shy. Even though, there is a lot of variety within the grup, they are still very unified.<P>\r\nThe women of \"Light and Life\" like the idea of working through communal banks because they feel that it unifies the women and motivates them. They also believe that it creates leadership within the group since problems are resolved through the board of directors.

Uno encontraba una combinaci\u00f3n de mujeres ind\u00edgenas y ladinas. Esta combinaci\u00f3n le daba al grupo una caracter\u00edstica especial al grupo ya que las integrantes llevan consigo los aspectos especiales de sus culturas. No solo eso, sino que tambi\u00e9n hab\u00eda una variedad de negocios. En este grupo podemos encontrar mujeres que van a invertir su cr\u00e9dito en crianza de pollo, tiendas de consumo diario, perfumer\u00eda, peluquer\u00edas, venta de carne de marrano, venta de hot dogs y gaseosas y una funeraria. Debido a esta variedad, uno pod\u00eda encontrar distintas personalidades dentro del grupo tales como mujeres aguerridas, valientes, conservadoras, extrovertidas o un poco t\u00edmidas. Sin embargo, a pesar de esta variedad la uni\u00f3n del grupo es inigualable. \r\n\r\n<P>A las mujeres de Luz y Vida les gusta trabajar bajo la metodolog\u00eda de bancos comunales porque ellas sienten que este estilo de trabajo promueve unidad entre las se\u00f1oras. Adem\u00e1s, creen que promueve liderazgo dentro del grupo ya que cualquier problema es avocado a la junta directiva. Finalmente, a ellas les gusta trabajar con The Friendship Bridge por los bajos intereses y por el apoyo constante que la instituci\u00f3n da a las mujeres guatemaltecas.\r\n\r\n<P>El sue\u00f1o de muchas de estas clientas es que su negocio se vuelva sostenible y as\u00ed ya no tengan que depender de una deuda para poder mantener su negocio. Otras quieren que sus hijos se grad\u00faen del colegio y de la universidad. Estas se\u00f1oras ya han logrado mucho, sin embargo ellas aspiran a m\u00e1s \u00a1Ellas quieren que sus familias salgan adelante junto con ellas, es por eso que las tenemos que
