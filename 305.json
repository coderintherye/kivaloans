","en":"The Dios Te Ama Communal Bank, represented by Ms. Sandra, is comprised of 15 group members who are currently in their first loan cycle. They are very enthusiastic about working together to help move their small businesses forward. Some members sell things like American clothing, bread, sausages, empanadas, and beverages. Other members work in public transportation, welding, or as employees in public companies. The group members know how to get ahead in business so that they can give their families their daily bread. This loan will be used to make their businesses grow by purchasing merchandise, supplies, spare parts, and the tools they need to provide service. Regarding their experience with solidarity groups, most of the group members have already dealt with similar microfinance institutes, but none of those institutes have given them the support and trust that this foundation has, allowing them to make progress with their plans to grow and provide their families with a better quality of life. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Elizabeth

In terms of competition, the group members are people who produce and sell high-quality products that they make themselves, which is why they have faithful customers who help them generate the profits necessary for their family expenses. For this reason, they need this loan in order to make their businesses grow by obtaining supplies, materials and the new tools that they need to make a greater quantity of products and offer better services. Thus, they can generate more income, which will allow them to give their families a better quality of life. Regarding experience with solidarity groups, a large majority of the members have previously worked with similar microfinance institutes, but none has ever given them the support and trust that the Fundaci\u00f3n has given them so that they can make progress with their plans of growth, in so doing, giving their families a better quality of life. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by

Because all of the money that used to be invested in the store was now invested in the land, the stock in her store was left depleted. \r\n\r\nNow that the harvest is near, Mar\u00eda wants to restock her business.  Because of this she has seen the need to ask Edpyme Alternative for a loan for the first time.  She is asking for a loan for 1,000 PEN to buy more products.\r\n\r\nShe wants to keep working to help her husband.  Together they will get the family ahead.  Mar\u00eda is a hard-working woman who is active and very responsible.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":425675,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"Buy basic needs items to restock her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Insculas -

He raises sheep and hogs for sale to his neighbors and businesses in the area. This work is the only thing that provides him with a steady income. Occasionally he works as an agricultural laborer in nearby fields.\r\n<p>\r\nHe would like to start feeding his animals with some type of balanced diet in order to improve their quality. For this reason he finds himself applying for the first time, for a loan of 1000 PEN from Edpyme Alternativa.\r\n<p>\r\nHe is a responsible young man who is working passionately to achieve his goals. He would like to continue raising animals and save enough money to build his own house and acquire a plot of farmland where he can work as a farmer and in that way help his loved ones succeed. \r\n<br

This community is in Olmos District, Lambayaeque Province, which is 2 hours away from the city of Chiclayo.  \r\n<p>\r\nSince her husband works as a farm laborer, he does not earn a permanent salary.  One year ago, Carolina began selling clothing to neighbors and residents of nearby villages.  She works by taking orders and then purchasing the merchandise in Chiclayo.  \r\n<p>\r\nCarolina says she came up with the idea to start this business because her village is too far from Chiclayo and that the clothes being sold in the nearest town of Olmos are expensive.  She started with only a few customers, but she now travels frequently in order to obtain more merchandise to keep up with demand.\r\n<p>\r\nShe is requesting her first loan from Edpyme Alternativa in the amount of 1000 soles.  The funds will be used to buy more inventory so that she can expand her business.\r\n<p>\r\nCarolina is a cheerful and very responsible woman.  Her greatest dream is to build a home and buy cabinets for storing clothing.  In the photograph, she appears with the two bags she currently uses to hold clothes.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

He lives with his wife in the Mocape settlement, which is located in the Olmos district, Lambayeque province.  This is two hours from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nHe has been farming for 20 years.  He started working as a field worker.  Little by little, with his savings and much effort, he was able to get a piece of farming land.  That is where he currently plants passion fruit, mangos, and tamarinds in association with other farmers in the area.\r\n\r\nHis wife raises small animals (sheep, pigs, goats).  With these activities they have gotten ahead since they started living together.\r\n\r\nHe finds himself, for the first time, asking Edpyme Alternative for a loan for 1,000 PEN.  He will invest in the planting and maintenance of 500 new passion fruit plants, which will expand his business.\r\n\r\nJuan is responsible and very hard-working.  In the group where he plants, all of the farmers offer support when necessary.  His biggest goal is to see the hydroenergetic project in the area finished.  This allows for watering the crops with greater ease.  Now they water the fruit trees by taking water from underground wells.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

What he most desires is to buy his own lot where he can set up his vehicle dismantling shop in order to provide for his family and give a good education to his three sons who are students.  He lives in Santa Rosa in the capital city of Managua on the edge of the track.  His plan is to improve his small house.  With this loan he will buy zinc and metal tubing to build a covered work area so that he can work under shelter from the sun since working in the sun all afternoon burns and upsets him very much.

The idea started with her mother so that she could help her economically.  As a way of helping her, her parents gave her the money to buy clothes so that she would have her own income and not be dependent solely on her husband.  He is a driver, and his salary is low.\r\n\r\nThey are saving because they are starting to build their house.  They want to finish it soon to have more privacy and to be in better conditions.  She is 21, and she has a pretty four year old daughter.  Her mother takes care of her daughter when Xiomara leaves to sell on the street or to deliver clothing orders to her customers.  She sells for cash and for credit every two weeks on payday.  The problem she has had is that sometimes they do not pay on time, and their payments are delayed.\r\n\r\nWith this loan she wants to buy toys and more clothing for women, men, and children.

For the past year she has sold tamales (a typical dish made from corn).  Every afternoon she canvasses the plaza and streets of her district to sell her product to the occasional customer.  Her husband works sporadically as an agricultural laborer at the area's agroindustrial cooperative but does not earn enough to cover family expenses so she has to work daily to help with household costs.  The good flavoring in her tamales has resulted in customers placing orders for them but she doesn't have the necessary capital to fill them.  This is why she is asking Edpyme Alternativa for a first loan of 1,000 new soles to buy the necessary ingredients to make her tamales.  She is a hard-working, responsible, very optimistic mother.

Together with her husband, they live in the home of their parents.\r\n\r\nAbout six months ago she became independent, as she used to work with her parents on their farmlands.  Now, she works for herself on lands that her parents gave her to produce crops.  Since then, Ana and her husband have worked at clearing the fertile land and removed the weeds that affect the planting of coffee and bananas which are the items they want to grow.  This activity brings Ana a great deal of satisfaction, as she has knowledge she gained while working with her parents that gives her the ability to produce a good crop.  In addition, her parents have provided her with the necessary tools to get ahead.  She wants to be able to support her child, who she adores.  On the other hand, her husband works removing debris and sowing seeds for other people as well, and Ana brings him lunch and then helps him while the baby sleeps peacefully.  In this manner, the work is finished quicker which gives him the opportunity to start with his other work, which is beneficial for both of them.\r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with MFP and, given that they are motivated by the references they have with the institution, they are disposed to request the loan and meet the goals they have set for themselves.  They intent to use the funds to buy 400 banana plants to place on the land they have already prepared for crops. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":425757,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase banana plants.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-11-17T13:00:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":600,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":225,"local_amount":600,"processed_date":"2010-08-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:17Z","rounded_local_amount":645.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166886548,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-11-17T14:24:38Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":152394,"name":"Jos\u00e9 Seraf\u00edn","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Jos\u00e9 Seraf\u00edn A. es padre de familia y dos hijos peque\u00f1os de edad a quienes les quiere dar lo mejor. \nEsta solicitando un pr\u00e9stamo para pagar la diferencia de una vivienda ya que actual mente est\u00e1 pagando renta y le est\u00e1 pidiendo que desocupe la casa, y el mejor desea tener su propio patrimonio y un lugar seguro para su familia.

Despite his youth, he knows how to use his time very well since he works his coffee plantings, which he planted when he was 18 years old, from 8 in the morning.  He planted them in a farm his parents gave him but he also helps his parents with their banana plantings since those crops remind him of a happy childhood.  Denis wants to be economically independent from his father and that's why he wants to set up another coffee plant nursery on a space available on his parents' farm.

Elizabeth has been engaged in her business for more than four years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Elizabeth joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Elizabeth has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Elizabeth is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Elizabeth from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and reaches out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

B. is from the village of Libertad, Misamis Oriental. She is 22 years old. Lynn is married and has one infant child. To make a living, Lynn owns and operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food and daily use products in the local community. Lynn has been engaged in her business for more than three years and earns approximately 9,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Lynn joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Lynn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 11,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Lynn is requesting a new loan of 14,000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Lynn from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and reaches out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

In order to support the needs of their 2 children, Cristina and Justine, her husband works abroad as a seaman. Remelio suffers from being away from his family in order to sustain their needs because now they have more expenses for the education of their children; sending children to college is very expensive. Both children are now in college, the older one taking up nursing and the second, mechanical engineering. In order to help her husband in providing for their family, Daisy runs a sewing business. She sews curtains that she sometimes sells or sometimes customers order from her. This business has operated for 18 years now and and hopefully will continue to grow. Through the money that she saves they been able to buy their own tricycle (type of cab in the Philippines that has a three wheels), and the revenue from it also contributes to their income.<p>\r\n\r\nWhen she became a member of Kiva field partner Ahon sa Hirap Inc. (ASHI), the loan that she received was a big help in improving her sewing business and its revenue really helps for their big expenses. Now, her 12th loan will be used to improve this business. She will buy all the necessary things that are needed so that her business will be more productive.<p>\r\n\r\nOne dream of Daisy's is that their children will finish their studies, because she believes that education is one of the keys to having a better life in the future. Daisy hoping that her business will continue to grow and someday she can have her own dress shop to generate enough income so that her husband has no need to go abroad to provide for them."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":426030,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"To finance her

Aisha works seven days a week. She receives an average of 25 customers a day. Her major business challenges include ever-increasing prices of foodstuffs and the rainy season, which disturbs her work because she works from a muddy place. Her monthly expenses include rent, monthly market dues, feeding the family and medication. She has been in this business for over three years and with MCDT for five years, servicing her tenth loan working with the same group-mates.  Aisha joined MCDT because it was near her home and also because of working in groups. She wants to use this loan to buy more bunches of bananas, sacks of cassava, and sweet potatoes. She aspires to see her business grow bigger and start buying directly from farmers.\t\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":224.83,"image":{"id":426052,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"To

The school serves a total of 805 students (338 boys, 467 girls) and employs 23 teachers. In operation for 12 years, it receives a small annual stipend from the government to help cover its operating costs (very few schools in Sierra Leone are funded exclusively by the government). The school reports many successes, including the fact that the external (national) exam scores for their pupils have been steadily increasing thanks in large part to the teachers' hard work. For many of the teachers here, however, life can be a struggle. The school has fallen into disrepair, and there are no funds available to build additional classrooms, repair walls, replace broken desks, or make other necessary adjustments. Furthermore, many teachers' salaries are long overdue, with some that have waited over two years to receive a paycheck. Many teachers engage in side-projects and small businesses in order to supplement (or in some cases replace) their salaries, and Khulafai's teachers are collectively seeking a loan of SLL 11 million from SMT and Kiva Lenders.<p>\r\n\r\nMomodu K. (pictured second from right, back row) is a senior teacher at the school and has taken on the role of group leader. Momodu is 46 years old and has been teaching young children for 25 years. He is married to a petty trader, and together they have eight children (three boys and five girls). Five of Momodu's children attend school and three are not yet old enough. Some time ago, he purchased a plot of land on which he dreamed of building a house for his family because he believes that \"once you own a home, you have something for which you and your family can be proud.\" He plans to use his portion of the funds to finance the purchase of some materials so that he can begin construction.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\n\t\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous, and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment, forcing hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<p>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

With starting capital of $100 US, and thanks to his perseverance and dedication, he began this enterprise 15 years ago. \r\n<p>\r\nToday, he needs to buy additional foodstuff to increase the range of his goods. For this purpose, Djafar is requesting a loan of $800 US. He is ready to work even harder, make sacrifices and push every once in a while to achieve his goal and become a successful entrepreneur. We believe his perseverance and clear vision will become key success factors in his business. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International:<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its epic mountain passes and its rich history which includes its place as a key post along the Silk Road and events at the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects.

He is married and is the happy father of three children. He owns a market vending business located in a busy locale where he sells men's clothing. Nemat decided to start his own business after he was unable to find other work. In addition to his business, he also works part time as a taxi driver, which enables him to supplement his income. \r\n<p>\r\nNemat has requested a loan of 5,000 Somoni.

It is also known for its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi, and many others. The country, filled with epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and boasts a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nMore about IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Muzafar is 57 years old. He is married with four children. Muzafar has been farming since he was 29 years old, and now he specializes in the cultivation of seedlings. He has gained a great deal of experience working the land for so many years. When it is the season to do so, he willingly works in the field from early morning till late night. Muzafar has a large and friendly family and they all try to help each other. \r\n<p>\r\nMuzafar has requested $800 in order to purchase seeds and mineral fertilizer. He thanks everyone who supports him and promises to repay the loan in a timely manner. \r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes being a key post along the Silk Road and being the location of the end of the rule of Alexander the Great. It is also known for its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi, and many others. The country, filled with epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and boasts a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nMore about IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She has a family consisting of four members, having raised two sons aged twenty three and nineteen respectively. All members of Suiun\u2019s family have different jobs.\r\n\r\nSuiun\u2019s husband works at the public assistance service of Bishkek city as a leading specialist; her eldest son works in a furniture salon \u201cShatura\u201d as a furniture maker; her other son works as a waiter in a caf\u00e9 and is enrolled in college \u2013 he is getting tuition by correspondence.\r\n\r\nSuiun works as a teacher at an elementary school. Besides that, she manages to look after some cattle. The fact is that long ago, before their marriage, Suiun\u2019s husband already had some livestock. Suiun and her husband have made best use of their opportunities and have achieved great success in increasing the population of livestock and in improving the quality of their living. The livestock allowed them to meet various needs like providing education for their sons, buying convenience goods for the house and making repairs to their home, etc.\r\n\r\nFor the last twenty-five years, raising livestock has been an extra occupation and an extra source of income for the whole family, which every member of the family has shared concerns about. Suiun wants to continue dealing with cattle as it allows them to have quick and large amount of money whenever they need it. Therefore, she has applied for this loan to be able to buy two calves.\r\n\r\nSuiun\u2019s partners are Tolobek, Gulzat and Sveta:\r\n\r\nTolobek, 48, has three children and his wife is a teacher. To make a living, Tolobek works as a stoker at a railway station. He needs a loan to buy a calf to raise.\r\n\r\nGulzat, 36, has two children and her husband works in construction. Gulzat is a teacher at an elementary school. She hopes to obtain this loan to buy a milk cow.\r\n\r\nSveta, 41, is the mother of four children and her husband is a taxi driver. Sveta is a photographer, providing photographic services at weddings. Obtaining this loan would enable Sveta to buy a printer, which she needs in her work.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>======================================\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---<\/b><br>\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.<p>\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of the 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable in order to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

She works in a semi-urban area on the outskirts of Kampala. \r\n<p>\r\nGladys owns a stall in Naguru market, selling bananas, cassava, sweet potatoes, and Irish potatoes. Gladys works seven days a week. She receives an average of 25 customers a day. Her major business challenges include ever-increasing prices of foodstuffs and the rainy season, which disturbs her work because she works in an open place. Her monthly expenses include rent, monthly market dues, feeding the family, and medication. She has been in this business for over three years and with MCDT for five years, now servicing her tenth loan working with the same group mates. Gladys joined MCDT because it was near her home and also because of the availability of group loans. \r\n<p>\r\nShe wants to use this loan to buy more bunches of bananas, sacks of cassava, and sweet potatoes. She aspires to see her business expand and would eventually like to be able to start going directly to farmers to buy produce.\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":224.83,"image":{"id":426119,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She has a life partner and a 25 year old son that still depends on her for support.\r\n\r\nHer enterpreneurial spirit and the love for her family motivated her to start her own business and with her husband they offer massage services.  She offers the service from her own home in a nicely conditioned area to serve her clients.  She mentions that little by little her business has grown and by gaining experience in the field, she now feels very proud of her accomplishment.\r\n\r\nWith the $700 loan, she will purchase products such as aromatherapy oils, candles, towels and white as well as different color robes to offer more comfort.  She will invest part of the money purchasing paint to improve the infrastructure of her business area and by doing so offering better customer service to her clients.\r\n\r\nJesus wishes to eventually make her business a SPA and expresses the conviction to make her dream come true because she is the type of woman that achieves the goals she sets for herself.  She is thankful to the Manuela Ramos Movement for the continued help with her business and also to the many enterpreneurial women that want to grow. \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Linda Zamora, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":426152,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","use":"to purchase aromatherapy products for her massage service business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"San Mart\u00edn","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2009-11-14T03:10:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jesus ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2010-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.66},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.66},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2009-11-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:39:45Z","rounded_local_amount":335.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103835935,"comment":null},{"amount":116.66,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2009-12-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:07:14Z","rounded_local_amount":335.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110727721,"comment":null},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2010-01-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:05:53Z","rounded_local_amount":335.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118118092,"comment":null},{"amount":116.66,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:44:05Z","rounded_local_amount":335.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123953813,"comment":null},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-23T07:54:37Z","rounded_local_amount":335.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128986906,"comment":null},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":333.35,"processed_date":"2010-04-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-02T07:56:21Z","rounded_local_amount":335.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136713043,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-11-25T05:00:43Z","paid_date":"2010-06-02T07:56:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":152591,"name":"Eunice","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Eunice is a forty-seven-year-old married mother of three children who are all in school.

The most common form of clothing sales in the Dominican Republic is used clothing, usually from the U.S., but Marcelo has differentiated her business by only selling the newest styles. With this loan, her fourth with Esperanza International, she hopes to continue investing in her business, continually expanding her items offered and keeping up with the latest trends.\r\n\r\nLife in La Romana can be harsh \u2013 electricity is scarce if available at all, running water is never potable, and the hurricanes that rip through the Caribbean typically hit this side of the island first. Despite these difficulties, Marcelo keeps a positive attitude toward her business. She hopes to continually grow her business, and she is very grateful for the support given to her by Esperanza.

She is a 45-year-old mother of three children, all grown up, and lives with her partner. Llerme, along with her husband, decided to set up some rooms to rent by the month out of their home, offering the service to students and acquaintances from other places looking to stay and work in Tarapoto. They have stuck with the business and currently have five rooms for rent. Furthermore, Llerme works selling plastics and travels to the different towns surrounding her city. With the loan of 3,000 soles she is requesting, she plans to purchase bricks, cement and plywood to build more rooms. She'll also use part of the money to buy accessories for the bathrooms to provide better service and hygiene. In this way her tenants will remain satisfied and content.

He has 4 children and lives with his partner in his own home.  Years ago he planned his future by building five large nurseries from which he sold part of the product and part he transplanted to his own farmlands.  But nothing prepared him for the mosquito plague that would attack the leaves of his crops and he was unable to control it in time losing many coffee beans as a result.  For this reason, his crop yields last year were greatly diminished despite his dedication and hard work.  Despite the sadness, Jos\u00e9 believes that all is not lost because, as he states, he feels he can salvage them this year or next year, perhaps.

In spite of his economic limitations, he is now preparing the land where he will plant.\r\n\r\nNelson joined the MFP communal bank on his sister\u2019s recommendation.  He promises to make all of his payments on the established days.  He will use the money he is asking for to buy coffee plants.  If there is not enough, he will start with bananas in order to plant as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":426322,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Buy coffee or banana plants","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-11-14T20:40:21Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nelson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":350,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-08-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1007.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166886568,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-11-16T20:25:54Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":152682,"name":"Maria Santos","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"la sra.

To be involved in agreiculture is very healthy for Priscila.  Because of this, even if in small amounts, each year she plants in her parents' fields.  This season of November she was able to sell her flowers (gladiolas) at a very good price in the city's flower market earning back twice her investment.

With her children's help, she will continue to make progress and cover her needs. Her goal is to reopen her business, and with the financing she hopes to achieve this; she is just giving herself a little time to get started. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia

She is married and the mother of 4 children, two of whom still depend on her.  For ten years she has sold fresh fish from a stall in the central market in her district.  Inspired by the need to contribute to her family's income and having 500 soles that were very well invested, she is able still to be engaged in this business but now with a greater variety and quantities of species.  With this 1,000 sol loan she means to buy kilograms of locally-produced fresh fish as well as fish from the country's coastal regions like:  bocachico (a fresh-water, migratory fish), palometas (pomfret, an important food fish), toa, gamitada (a tasty river fish from the Amazon basin), tilapia, toyo, pejerrey (smelt), to keep her business well-stocked and satisfy her customers' demanding taste.

Susana S. said. She is helping her husband earn a living by collecting and selling firewood in their village. During weekends, their children also help her collect wood, and she is very grateful to them because they know that her business means a lot to their family.\r\n\r\nSusana is married to Pedro, a local farmer in their village. They are helping each other to provide for the needs of their family, especially the education of their children who are still studying. They are blessed with five children: Antonio, 33 years old and a high school graduate; Orlan, 29 years old and a high school graduate; Eric, 21 years old and an elementary school graduate; Maximo, 15 years old and a senior high school student; and Christian, 11 years old and a fifth grade student. \r\n<p>\r\nSusana wanted to become an entrepreneur, but lack of capital prevented her from sustaining her wood business. Therefore, she is requesting a loan from the Kiva lenders amounting to 5,000 PHP, which she will use as capital to run her business. She is very optimistic that lenders will approve her loan.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":419403,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fuel\/Firewood","sector":"Retail","use":"Additional

She is 21 years old. Lovely Ann is married and has one infant child. To make a living, Lovely Ann owns and operates a \"tricycle\" business in the local community. Lovely Ann is just starting this business.\r\n\r\nLovely Ann joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Lovely Ann is requesting a new loan of 3000 PHP, which will be used as additional capital. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Lovely Ann from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income for their daily needs. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

Norma is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase fertilizer such as manure and invest in another business. This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Norma from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family and save for future needs. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.
