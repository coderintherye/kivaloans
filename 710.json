Lita and her partner work hard to give their children a better quality of life. Lita raises poultry. She has a small chicken shed where she is raising 200 chickens. Her partner works at various jobs and does not have a fixed monthly income. This is why she decided to help with the household expenses. This is how she started this small project which initially began as a small hobby. Now, it is a way of life for her. She works alone but on occasion her older children help her. What she likes about her work is that it gives her independence and allows her to manage her own time. She is doing well and hopes to continue doing so. She plans on growing her business and setting up a few more chicken sheds. This will be her 3rd loan with MFP. She is very happy knowing that she will have financial support as in this way she will feel secure moving forwards with her business. On the other hand, she agrees once again to make her repayments, as she did with the previous loan she had. She also likes being a part of her communal bank as all the members are very responsible and very supportive people.

is Irine, 38, a resident of Tanza, Cavite City, Philippines. Her husband Luisito is a miner. Irine is mother to two children, both of whom are already studying in elementary school. She, together with her husband and children, manages their own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses. \r\n\r\nIrine operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, five Philippine Peso's (PHP)-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 350 PHP in sales every day. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 15,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products needed in her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nIrine hopes her business grows into a mini-grocery and dreams to be able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":277.08,"image":{"id":913368,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To pay for grocery items and products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Tanza, Cavite","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-11-13T18:10:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Irine ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":15000,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2011-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2011-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2011-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2011-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2011-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2011-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2011-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2011-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2011-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":625}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.59},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.59},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.59},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.59},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.59},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.59},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.59},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.59},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":3750,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:31:44Z","rounded_local_amount":3765.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244529495,"comment":null},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:39:19Z","rounded_local_amount":2510.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250738711,"comment":null},{"amount":58.34,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:48:28Z","rounded_local_amount":2510.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257145943,"comment":null},{"amount":72.91,"local_amount":3125,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:01:37Z","rounded_local_amount":3137.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263274963,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-11-18T18:23:57Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":355804,"name":"Deo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Deo is 38 years old and lives in the town of Rukoki in the Fort Portal region of Uganda.

is Mercy, 28, a resident of Tanza, Cavite City, Philippines. Her husband is Romy, a driver, and she is a mother to her only child. She, together with her husband, manages their own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nMercy operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Aside from this, she also does manicures and pedicures for additional income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 300 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 14,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products needed in her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMercy hopes her business grows in the coming years and dreams of being able to give her child a good and high quality education through all her hard work.

","en":"Chinarkul is 54 years old, married, and has three children. Her husband, Kadyrbek, is a veterinarian. Chinakul started her business, breeding and raising livestock, with an initial investment of 5,000 KGS, and has expanded her farm to 5 cows and 60 rams, currently bringing in about 15,000 KGS per month. The farm, which has become a family business, has a promising future. The small town of Asylbash, where Chinarkul lives with her family, is an ideal place to raise animals, as there are many pastures for grazing livestock. With the goal of increasing the amount of livestock further, Chinarkul has turned to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 80,000 KGS, to purchase cows. She plans to use the income obtained from investing the loan to further develop her business.

In the recent 2011 season, Joseph had a very good maize yield harvesting 13 bags on \u00bd acre of land. Before joining One Acre Fund,  Joseph was only able to harvest four bags of maize on \u00bd  acres of land.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, One Acre Fund will purchase fertilizer, seeds, and other important inputs to distribute to Joseph and her group during Kenya\u2019s next planting season in February 2012.

She lives in village in Ceguaca, Santa B\u00e1rbara; she\u2019s been married for 15 years.\r\n\r\nA year ago Emma started making and selling fried banana chips in this community.  She used to do so in San Pedro Sula and she started it with funds of her own.  Now she lives in this community and she does better because no one else does this same activity and she is in high demand.  Besides, it\u2019s more profitable because the bananas are less expensive here so profits are higher.  She and her husband run the business.  She has the opportunity to sell to local and nearby grocery stores.\r\n\r\nThis is her first loan and she will use it to buy ingredients needed to make her product like bananas, barbecue salt, flavored salt, bags and oil.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":91.67,"image":{"id":913674,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

He has sold fish for about 18 years. His business is located in the center of the city of Barranquilla, where there is a steady flow of people, which helps him have regular customs between neighboring vendors and friends. His dream is to grow his business and gradually become a wholesaler. Right now, he is constantly purchasing small quantities. \r\n\r\nThis is his first loan with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation. He will use the Kiva loan to purchase a freezer. The freezer will allow him to store his products correctly and to purchase larger quantities at a time. Right now, he stores the fish in a styrofoam cooler. He sells his products on credit, and most of his clients pay every 8 days. Other customers pay cash. Pedro is a man that likes his work. He always offers his clients what they need and what they can pay for.

Once she has separated the clothes, she goes in search of buyers who are mostly the residents of the villages and towns near the city. She has been doing this work alone for a year. What she likes about the work is that she invests little and makes a good percentage in profit. In addition, it allows her to spend almost every day with her children as she only travels 2 days a week and on those days she makes enough sales for the whole week. She is doing well as her partner contributes to the household. She awaits the opportunity of selling in larger quantities and thereby increasing profits. This will be her first loan with MFP.
