She is married to Nolasco, a driver, and a mother to her children. She and her husband manage their own household while operating their business. At this time, Esmeralda is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses and support her child\u2019s schooling. \r\n\r\nEsmeralda operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns profit by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 400 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 26,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products needed for her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nEsmeralda dreams to grow her business in the coming years, just as she fervently hopes that her children will be able to get married and have their family some day. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":885593,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To pay for grocery items and products needed for her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Silang, Cavite","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-10-08T02:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Esmeralda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":26000,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1083.41}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":200,"local_amount":8667,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:37:32Z","rounded_local_amount":8718.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238571835,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":4332.96,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:31:37Z","rounded_local_amount":4358.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244529385,"comment":null},{"amount":125,"local_amount":5417.04,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:39:12Z","rounded_local_amount":5449.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250738601,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":4332.93,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:48:48Z","rounded_local_amount":4358.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257145837,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":3250.07,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:01:55Z","rounded_local_amount":3269.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263274844,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-10-16T18:51:55Z","paid_date":"2012-03-15T09:01:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":342114,"name":"Rose's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rose's group is comprised of 5 hard working ladies.

He lives in the Tsovagyugh village in the Syunik region together with his wife and three children.  Andranik's daughters attend a school, and son goes to kindergarten.  Andranik is involved in agriculture and, parallel to that, sales of products and household goods.  His farm includes 3 cows, 2 calves and 20 chickens.  He has been selling food products and household goods for 10 years at a small wagon, which is located in close proximity to his home.  His wife helps him with the sales.

She earns a minimum of 800 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, Gliceria is requesting a PHP35,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy RTW products and merchandise items to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nGliceria hopes to be able to expand her business in the coming years.

In the future, Rustam wants to open his own kiosk, where he could sell vegetables, and, thus, expand his business.  Rustam does not have the necessary means to develop his retail business.  He needs a loan and he hopes that you would help him.  Obtaining this loan would bring benefit not only for business development, but for the family budget as well.

According to Yulia this business enables her to meet their daily needs. \r\n\r\nCurrently, Yuliana plans to raise more piglets but she needs more money to do so. She is requesting a loan of 7,500,000 Rupiah (IDR) from TLM to purchase four piglets and fodder. Yuliana really hopes that TLM is willing to assist her in improving her business.

To support her husband in generating income, Josinta runs a home-based kiosk business. \r\n\r\nShe started this business two years ago by utilizing the very small amount of capital that she had. She first received loan assistance from TLM in a group loan (she joined a group lending program twice).

However, she doesn't have enough capital to make it happen. Josinta then submitted her loan application and requesting a loan of 5,000,000 Rupiah (IDR) from TLM.

Filomena's husband resides and works in another province \u2013 Maluku. To make a living, Filomena runs a home-based kiosk business at her parent's house. She has been operating her small kiosk for about two years. She sells kerosene, corn, snacks, coffee, tea, shampoo etc. in small quantities. Her kiosk income is quite helpful to in providing daily meals for Filomena and her son. She is also responsible for supporting her parents' needs as she lives with them. \r\n\r\nTherefore Filomena always tries her best to increase her income. She wishes to improve her kiosk business to generate better income. One day her mother suggested that she apply for a loan from TLM. She looked for more information on the TLM Lending Program by visiting the nearest branch office and she found herself interested in joining the program. She is now requesting a loan of 5,000,000 Rupiah (IDR). The loan will be used to purchase hundreds of kilograms of corn. Filomena hopes that her loan application will be approved by TLM.

By the grace of God, Daisy has managed to support her child\u2019s schooling. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.<p>\r\n\r\nDaisy oversees the operation of their tricycle transportation business. They have one tricycle that carries up to four passengers to their destination within the community. Daisy\u2019s husband, who operates their tricycle, remits a boundary (daily quota) each day to her. Daisy also has a direct-selling business, with her neighbors and the local community as her regular customers. She earns a minimum of Php 584 Philippine Pesos (PHP) every day.<p>\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php10,000 loan to buy spare parts and accessories and to pay for the maintenance of her motorcycle. Part of the loan will also be used to buy orders for her customers, and she expects a boost in her business income as she expands her direct-sales enterprise.  <p>\r\n\r\nDaisy hopes to grow her business, and dreams of travelling abroad some day. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies.<p>\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She is married to Rolly, a barangay (village) worker. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income to cover their everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nPrecila operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She makes money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Aside from this, she also sells ornamental and garden plants. Her store is adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She has a minimum of 600 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 17,000 loan. She will utilize the loan to buy grocery items, beverages, and gardening materials needed in her business. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nPrecila hopes to expand her business soon and dreams to have a child someday.

","en":"Djamilya is a hard-working and conscientious woman.  She is married and has two adult and one adolescent sons.  She has been involved in preparing various salads for over 18 years.  Djamilya started her business with preparing two types of salads in small volumes.  Now, together with her older children, she prepares salads in large volumes and sell them at the market.  She buys fresh vegetables for her salads, and that is why they are in demand.  Djamilya has regular customers.  She tries to prepare not only delicious, but new salads that differ in appearance from others.  Djamilya knows that it is very hard to make it at the market because there is strong competition.

For the past 10 years, he has been working hard to manage his bar and brewery, which serves drinks and food to local customers. \r\n\r\nTo help expand his business, Festo has requested a loan of 1,500,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more firewood to brew beer, and will help him to generate greater profits and pay for his children's school fees. He hopes that in the future he will be able to start up a retail shop. \r\n\r\nFesto is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).  The program primarily serves small entrepreneurs like Festo who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans, but have businesses that have grown too large for micro-loans."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":201.15,"image":{"id":885822,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pub","sector":"Food","use":"to buy more firewood to brew beer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Bunghokho","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":65,"posted_date":"2011-10-08T16:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Festo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":1500000,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":102071},{"due_date":"2011-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":105758},{"due_date":"2011-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":109578},{"due_date":"2012-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":113536},{"due_date":"2012-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":117637},{"due_date":"2012-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":121886},{"due_date":"2012-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":126288},{"due_date":"2012-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":130849},{"due_date":"2012-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":135576},{"due_date":"2012-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":140472},{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":145546},{"due_date":"2012-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":150803}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.43},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.77},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.18},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.63},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.14},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.69},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.3},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.98},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.71},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.51},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.37},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.29}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":37.43,"local_amount":102071,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-19T08:52:41Z","rounded_local_amount":106851.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":239201856,"comment":null},{"amount":38.77,"local_amount":105758,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:29:01Z","rounded_local_amount":110710.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244524294,"comment":null},{"amount":40.18,"local_amount":109578,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:36:07Z","rounded_local_amount":114709.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250732972,"comment":null},{"amount":41.63,"local_amount":113536,"processed_date":"2012-01-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-18T08:48:58Z","rounded_local_amount":118853.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257687496,"comment":null},{"amount":43.14,"local_amount":117637,"processed_date":"2012-02-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-20T07:34:50Z","rounded_local_amount":123146.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":264132529,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-10-18T21:01:45Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":342290,"name":"Saymurod","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0421\u0430\u0439\u043c\u0443\u0440\u043e\u0434 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0436\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0432 \u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u0435 \u0414\u0430\u043d\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0430. \u0412\u043e\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0442, 58 \u043b\u0435\u0442. \u0416\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0442. \u0423 \u043d\u0435\u0433\u043e \u043f\u044f\u0442\u0435\u0440\u043e \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u041e\u043d \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0435\u0435 \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435. \u0410\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0443\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u043e\u043c\u0435\u0449\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435, \u0433\u0434\u0435 \u043e\u0442\u043a\u0440\u044b\u043b \u043d\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0443\u044e \u043a\u0443\u0445\u043d\u044e. \u0412 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u043e\u043d 20 \u043b\u0435\u0442. \u041a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0431\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0442 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0435\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0443\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u0438 \u043d\u0435\u043e\u0431\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0443\u0434\u044b.","en":"Saymurod lives in the Dangara district.

For the past two years, she has been working hard to manage her retail shop where she sells sugar and soap. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Dahufa has requested a loan of 200,000 Ugandan shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more sugar and soap to sell and will help Dahufa generate greater profit and pay for her school fees. Dahufa hopes that in the future she will be able to become a doctor. \r\n\r\nDahufa is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training. The ELA program has increased Dahufa's future prospects by helping her improve her business. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":74.08,"image":{"id":885833,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy more sugar and soap to sell.

The program primarily serves small entrepreneurs like Jackie who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans, but have businesses that have grown too large for microloans."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":265.18,"image":{"id":885857,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase seeds and other farming supplies for resale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Bunghokho","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":65,"posted_date":"2011-10-08T20:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jackie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":2000000,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":136112},{"due_date":"2011-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":141028},{"due_date":"2011-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":146122},{"due_date":"2012-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":151400},{"due_date":"2012-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":156868},{"due_date":"2012-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":162534},{"due_date":"2012-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":168405},{"due_date":"2012-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":174487},{"due_date":"2012-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":180790},{"due_date":"2012-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":187320},{"due_date":"2012-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":194085},{"due_date":"2012-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":200849}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.34},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.12},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.97},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.88},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.87},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.92},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.05},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.25},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.53},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.91},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.35},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.81}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":49.34,"local_amount":136112,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-19T08:52:37Z","rounded_local_amount":140867.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":239201862,"comment":null},{"amount":51.12,"local_amount":141028,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:28:57Z","rounded_local_amount":145955.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244524300,"comment":null},{"amount":52.97,"local_amount":146122,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:36:01Z","rounded_local_amount":151227.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250732978,"comment":null},{"amount":54.88,"local_amount":151400,"processed_date":"2012-01-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-18T08:48:47Z","rounded_local_amount":156689.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257687515,"comment":null},{"amount":56.87,"local_amount":156868,"processed_date":"2012-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-20T07:34:35Z","rounded_local_amount":162348.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":264132547,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-10-09T15:48:52Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":342312,"name":"Oyuntungalag","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Oyuntungalag is 45 years old and lives with her 23-year-old son and  her husband in Ulaanbaatar city, Mongolia.

Faridah is 21 years old and lives in the town of Seeta in the Mukono region of Uganda. She is married and has one child. For the past 2 years, Faridah has been working hard to manage her boutique shop, which sells clothes. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Faridah has requested a loan of 250,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more clothes for resale, and will help Faridah to generate greater profits and expand her business and take care of her family.  Faridah hopes that in the future she will be able to open up a big boutique shop. \r\n\r\nFaridah is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training. The ELA program has increased Faridah's future prospects by helping her to improving her business.

It bears mentioning that they generate good income, since his harvests are the best in the zone in agricultural campaigns. Ricardo's achievement is based on his training in how to produce a good coffee bean. Meanwhile, his plantains give them stability, as every 15 days, following harvest, he sells them in the central market of his city. For that reason, later on, Ricardo wants to buy more agricultural land, in which he can apply all he has learned and thus, have better crops each day, in both quantity and quality.\r\n\r\nRicardo belongs to the \u201cBuenos Aires\u201d (Good Breezes) communal bank and this is his 3rd loan with MFP, and he expects to advance with the association, since they are responsible persons with solidarity.

He is comforted by the fact that his new plants have reached an excellent point in their growth.  This assurance from his projects is quite amazing.  Now he wants to invest in more banana plants, so his plans are to acquire more farmland so that he can increase production and generate more revenue.  It only takes 15 days for banana plants to bear fruit, so he will be able to boost his sales.\r\n<p>\r\nRa\u00fal is a member of the Communal Bank \u201cBuenos Aires\u201d and this will be his fourth loan with MFP.  He serves as president of the association and is happy to direct and support the other members.  For this reason, he promises to be prompt with his payments and set a responsible example.

However, at his current age, he can not put forth the same physical effort as before and for that reason he opted to start a business and sell groceries: thus he could continue to make a profit without jeopardizing his health. His decision to start a business of this kind is because the few existing stores are too far from his township and in this way he can make it easier for his neighbors to meet their needs.\r\n\r\nEven so, Toribio wants to continue working simultaneously as a farmer.

She tells us that what she makes most is sleepwear, but she also makes clothes that she takes to certain bazaars to be sold\u200b\u200b. She works every day from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m., and sometimes even later when she has orders to deliver.  She has been working in this line of business for over 15 years.\r\n\r\nThis new loan will be used to buy fabric, thread, buttons and other sewing materials.  She is requesting this new loan to continue with her business, as she always needs materials to do her work.  The previous loan had a positive effect, as it helped her greatly in meeting certain orders that she had to deliver, and by delivering them on time she was assured of new orders.  The loan also helped her in her personal and family life, as now her daughter is at university, and she could cover the expenses that came about from her daughter beginning her studies.\r\n\r\nShe is a founding member of the community bank and is the president of it.

Norma is a kind and very helpful person.  She lives in Las Brisas neighborhood, in the town of Silca.  Her business is selling sweet treats.\r\n\r\nFour years ago, Norma received her high school diploma and, as she couldn't find work, she decided to start selling sweet treats as her mother taught her how to cook very well.  She starts serving her customers at 6.00pm and finishes at 9.00pm.  On weekends she finishes a little later.  While she is serving in her business, she helps take care of her two young children.  Her biggest challenge was to find an institution who would support her with a loan to invest in her business.
