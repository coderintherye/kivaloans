He is 41 years old and a widower. He lives with his young son in his own house, which was constructed on the basis of his labor. He lives in a rural village called Nueva Arica, which is located about 2 hours from the province of Chiclayo. The residents of the area in which he lives work totally in agriculture, livestock-raising, and handicrafts, among others. These are rural villages which are in the process of their development, so they only have basic electrical service.\r\n\r\nLeslier works daily to raise and later sell small animals such as ducks, turkeys, and hens, among others. He has done this work for approximately 11 years. He received his knowledge about the business from his parents, so he was able to set up strategic spaces for raising these animals at his own house. In addition, he also generates other daily income by working as a day laborer at various city properties.\r\n\r\nSince he was very young, Leslier worked in the fields, since his parents were always farmers. Now, with a family, he has decided to continue growing his business with the goal of giving a better education to his sons and therefore a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nBecause of his own desire to advance, Leslier has decided to apply to Edpyme Alternative for a loan in the amount of 2000 PEN for the purchase of balanced feed for his animals until they reach the ideal size and weight for sale.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1003187,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy balanced feed for his animals","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chiclayo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2012-02-15T03:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-16T03:00:02Z","loan_amount":750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leslier","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":139.7},{"due_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":144.25},{"due_date":"2012-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":148.85},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":151.95},{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":158.6},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":159.6},{"due_date":"2012-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":170.05},{"due_date":"2012-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":174.35},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":178.35},{"due_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":186.3},{"due_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":191.35},{"due_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":196.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.39},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.09},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.82},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.98},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.48},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.85},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.77},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.38},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.88},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.86},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.76},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.74}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-02-24T19:20:37Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":391595,"name":"Sofig","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"Sofig jenat i u nego chetvero detey.

She is the mother of Meylin, who is 2 years old.  She lives in her own house along with her live-in partner, Carlos, who is 28 years old.  She wants to offer a better quality of life to her family.  This is why she puts a lot of effort into her work.  Janina's work consists of selling clothing and shoes.  For quite some time she suffered some setbacks in her life.  This is because she did not have her own monetary income for her house.  It is for this reason that she decided a year ago to begin a new project.  She thought that her friends, neighbors, or relatives would want to buy clothing garments or shoes depending on the current season.  It is in this way that she began her business that is now giving her very good results.  She likes what she does, because it allows her to have time to be able to be with her young daughter.  Furthermore, since she began her business, she has been doing well economically, since they have two household incomes.  She wants to continue growing, and that is why she has in mind increasing her sales and being able to offer a greater variety and quality of garments to her customers.  This will be the 3rd loan with MFP, so she expects their collaboration to continue with her objectives.  On the other hand, she promises to pay her dues again in a punctual manner and to demonstrate, as in previous opportunities, that she is a very good partner.  In this way she will reward the support that is offered to her by her communal bank, where everyone is very responsible and supportive.  With the amount requested, 1500 soles, she will buy more merchandise since she desires to supply her scholastic campaign and offer school uniforms and shoes.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":87.55,"image":{"id":1003199,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"buy school shoes and school uniforms.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-02-15T03:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-16T03:30:02Z","loan_amount":575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Janina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":228.39},{"due_date":"2012-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":238.94},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":238.04},{"due_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":256.73},{"due_date":"2012-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":266.3},{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":271.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.55},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.59},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.25},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.42},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.08},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.11}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":87.55,"local_amount":228.39,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:32:04Z","rounded_local_amount":235.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263386517,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-16T06:33:06Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":392103,"name":"Leonarda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Leonarda is 51 years old and widowed with eight children.

The couple have seven children and they raise and care for two of them in their own home which is located in Jatumpampa.  \"In spite of how tiring it is to work on the farm, I like it a lot\", comments Teodocia, who has been sowing potatoes, olluco (a native tuber) and corn on rented land for 30 years.  She does not own land of her own because, at a very young age, she had to assume responsibility within her family.  However, she still has this dream and she hopes to fulfill it.  Teodor always helps her to care for the crops which they look after daily because they are noted for being good quality.  Her potato harvests are sold in the country's capital city.  People arrive at her land with trucks and take away all the delicious potatoes that she produces.  The corn is taken to the town market.  Teodocia also raises livestock.  She has 30 sheep that she pastures and fattens, and then sells at a good price.  \"I always have to keep some back to increase my herd\", she says.\r\n\r\nThis is Teodocia's third loan from MFP.

However, over the Christmas and New Year period he always has an increase in his sale of pigs because of the festivities.

years old and she is a single mother. With a lot of effort she is helping her 4 year old boy to get ahead, because he is the engine that motivates her to keep going everyday despite everything. She lives in the city of Imperial, which is known for its hot climate and generous people. She lives in her parents' house and they provide her with a lot of support. \r\n\r\nElizabeth loves to dance and two years ago she started a business providing entertainment at children's parties. Her 4 year old works with her, dressed as a little clown. She tries not to leave him alone and instead brings him to the children's parties when she is working. She had the idea for the business because when she was 16 years old she worked for a company that produced children's parties. She saved her money and was able to open her business but once her son was born she was not able to invest as much money in it because she needed it to pay for her son's expenses. But she was able to keep going and she loves what she does. Elizabeth thinks her business is going well because she loves to make children smile. \r\n\r\nElizabeth is very grateful to Kiva lenders because their support will allow her to buy more costumes, dolls and lights. This will help her improve her performances and satisfy her customers, who will hopefully recommend her to others. She hopes to increase her profits and continue to grow her business and above all fulfill the promise she has made to her son: to give him a profession and a better quality of life so that he can be proud of her. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1003248,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Musical Performance","sector":"Entertainment","use":"to buy costumes and lights.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Imperial","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2012-02-15T12:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-16T12:40:01Z","loan_amount":575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":103.05},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":105.02},{"due_date":"2012-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":110.41},{"due_date":"2012-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":112.9},{"due_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":118.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":121.37},{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":125.81},{"due_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":131.27},{"due_date":"2012-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":135.23},{"due_date":"2012-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":140.71},{"due_date":"2013-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":145.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":150.57}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.26},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.32},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.28},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.36},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.53},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.22},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.32},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.84},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.94},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.71},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-02-15T19:41:55Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":388831,"name":"Tity","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is 42 year old Tity.

She lives in a traditional family setting with her children in her late husband\u00b4s place, in the Somono district of S\u00e9gou (the fourth administrative region of the Republic of Mali). Tata was unable to attend school because of social reasons; she briefly attended Koranic school before leaving at a very early age to help her mother with her business activities. She worked by her mother\u00b4s side for several years before getting married, and benefited from a good commercial education which would enable her to get along better in the world of small retail. Tata tried out several revenue-generating activities before settling on the buying and resale of clothing. She has been selling clothes for 9 years and enjoys a good reputation and a large client\u00e8le. Her high sales figures are due to the quality of her high end clothing.\r\n\r\nTata is requesting this loan in order to be able to meet her customer demand. She has been a member of Soro Yiriwaso for 54 months and is on her 4th individual loan, having already fully repaid 4 group loans and 3 individual ones. She plans to use this loan to buy a bale of pagnes (highly decorative and colourful West African fabric).

She lives together with Juan, her husband of 23 years.  The couple have six children, five of whom still live with them in their own home, in the town of Jatumpampa.  Mar\u00eda's main business activity is sowing tubers.  She grows potatoes, corn, olluco (a native tuber) and peas.  She has been working in this business for 20 years and her vast experience has helped her to save up the money she needed to buy her own farmland.  However, she admits that she needs still more plots of land for her crops and so every year she hires land and thereby enables her production.  Mar\u00eda very much enjoys her work.  It makes her feel alive and very peaceful, above all right now when she is experiencing some very bad problems.  However, she does not become discouraged, she knows that life goes on and she would like to do well for her children's sake.  Every harvest time, Mar\u00eda sells her crops in the country's capital.  However, sometimes the buyers come to her and buy her entire harvest.  In addition, Mar\u00eda also raises animals such as sheep which she sells when the need arises and sometimes uses for her own consumption.  \r\n\r\nMaria belongs to the 'Jatumpampa al Progreso' community bank and this is her fourth loan from MFP.

They hired a driver from that area who administers the earnings with his son. That business does very well because there is almost no competition.\r\n\r\nDuring the day, her daughter-in-law tends to the grocery store that they have in their house and where they sell everyday items. As well as the animals that they breed, they have big and healthy corral chickens that they sell at every possibility.

She lives in the southern part of the city where she sells fast food, soft drinks and soup every day and also on weekends. She offers her customers a variety of products such as cakes and fritters. She started the business with the goal of increasing income to support her family. Her business has gone very well and she is enthusiastic about seeing it grow, even having it converted into a very well known and highly esteemed restaurant by her customers. \r\n\r\nMaria\u2019s sales volume is adjusted to her business infrastructure but she has gradually increased her clientele and that is when her working capital is insufficient to meet the demand. That is why she has come to Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo for her first loan because she needs to make higher volume cash purchases of the basic ingredients used in preparing her food so she can get discounts. As well she wants to buy larger sized cooking pots since she is now preparing her food in small pots in the patio of her house over wood fires. \r\n\r\nHer investment will be successful because she will get discounts and also she is making it at a time of high demand such as carnival season when there are festivities in the city and people do not cook but rather go out for food and drink. Her sales will increase as has happened before. Consequently Maria needs to be prepared to earn more money and to increase her working capital. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1003126,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to make higher volume cash purchases of the basic ingredients used to prepare her food so she can get discounts and to also buy larger-sized cooking pots.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-02-15T20:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-16T20:00:02Z","loan_amount":475,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Del Rosario","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":800000,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":74444},{"due_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":73692},{"due_date":"2012-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":75412},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":77171},{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":78972},{"due_date":"2012-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":80815},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":82700},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":84630},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":86605},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":85559}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.2},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.76},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.77},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.82},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.89},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.99},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.1},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.25},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.42},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.8}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-02-19T15:53:27Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":392205,"name":"Priscilla","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Priscilla is 32 years old, single, and has two children.

She lives together with Samudio, her husband of 30 years.  The couple have five children who are no longer dependent on them.  However, she still lives with one of her daughters, Alejandrina, who she cares for in her own home, in the town of El Tambo.  Gabriela is a selfless mother.  She built her home with five floors so that she could leave one to each of her children.  Gabriela's has been a life of hard work and sacrifice.  On the first floor of her home she set up a restaurant in partnership with her daughter and daughter-in-law.  Here she sells homemade food and, in the evenings, she sells traditional food such as 'anticuchos' (kebabs), 'rachi' (tripe), 'picarones' (sweet potato\/squash fritters) and coffee to her diners.  On weekends, she prepares a variety of hen, chicken and beef stews and dishes.  This helps her to vary her restaurant's offerings and she provides her customers with a choice of dishes.  Gabriela is very thorough in preparing her food.  She always chooses fresh and healthy ingredients.  As a result, her diners prefer to buy from her.  In addition to preparing local food, because Gabriela's husband lives in the city of Iquitos where he works as a lawyer, she opened an office in her home.  \"He sends me a pension as he is a retired police officer\" Gabriela says.\r\n\r\nGabriela is a member of the \"Mujeres Solidarias\" community bank and this is her first loan from MFP.

He lives together with his wife and two children in a rented house, in Chilca district.  The city of Huancayo is very big and there is an awful lot of traffic.  For this reason, the locals travel around in taxis.  Rufo saw this need as an opportunity.  Four years ago he started offering a transport service with a car that he had just acquired and turned the car into his work tool.  Every day, from very early in the morning, he drives round the streets of his city in search of customers who ask him to transport them to different parts of the city.  He charges according to the distance traveled.  \"If the trip is in an urban area, I charge less but from cone to cone [outlying district to outlying district] the price is much higher\", he says  Rufo considers his work to be profitable because the service he offers is very much in demand.  In addition, he always tries, as far as possible, to cover the urban areas because in his business this means that he prolongs the life of his vehicle and delays wear and tear.  Rufo would like to improve his business and own an additional car so that he can make better profits.\r\n\r\nRufo is a member of the \"Las Emprendedoras\" community bank and this is his 19th loan from MFP.  He is happy to know that he will have financial support and be able to make progress in his business.  For his part, he pledges once again to make his repayments on time.  He enjoys being a member of his community bank because all the members are responsible and supportive people.  With your support, Rufo will invest his money in buying spare parts and pay to have maintenance work carried out on his car."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1003705,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","use":"to buy spare parts and to pay a mechanic to carry out maintenance work on his vehicle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-02-15T21:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-16T21:30:05Z","loan_amount":1325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rufo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3500,"loan_amount":1325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":793.01},{"due_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":862.17},{"due_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":905.11},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":939.71}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300.21},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":326.39},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":342.65},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":355.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-02-16T13:35:56Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":390981,"name":"Edison Roberto","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Edison es un hombre de 21 a\u00f1os de edad, tiene muchas aspiraciones en los pr\u00f3ximos a\u00f1os de prosperar su venta de art\u00edculos de hogar.\n\nSu historia comenz\u00f3 por tratar de ayudar a su mama porque era madre soltera y se compro una motocicleta de segunda, tiene dificultades son el sector es un poco peligroso los ladrones seria un serio problema, est\u00e1 soltero, no tiene hijos, su sue\u00f1o es mejorar su calidad de vida y terminar su casa. \n\nQuiere el pr\u00e9stamo para su venta de art\u00edculos de hogar y asi generar mas ingresos y ayuda a la familia con los gastos. \n\n","en":"Edison is a 21-year-old man who has a great desire to boost his business over the next few years.

Juana is a single woman principally working on her farm, land that she was able to get with great sacrifice over these last 25 years.  Now, thanks to the work that she does, she has her own land with coffee plants that are very productive.  Juana says that she also has problems in the rainy season since that is when destructive insects appear that hurt her crops, and she doesn't have the financial capacity to resolve these issues.

She also works as administrative staff in an educational institution, but admits that the farming is what she most likes to do.  With the help of her oldest son she is able to speed up her work and save on paying personnel, but when the work is more intense, for example during the harvest, she has to hire workers.\r\n\r\nShe hopes that her new coffee crop will be successful.  She will fight for this, as is proper.  This would be the first time that Martha would get a loan from MFP.  This is why she promises to be punctual in making her monthly payments.  Virgen del Carmen is the name of her recent communal bank.  She feels enthusiastic about being part of it.\r\n\r\nShe will invest the money to buy 1000 coffee plants, each one of which costs 20 Peruvian cents.  With this she will begin her planting of two \"cuadras.\"\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":44.88,"image":{"id":1003729,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy one thousand coffee plants.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-02-16T02:40:15Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-17T02:40:15Z","loan_amount":575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Martha ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":117.09},{"due_date":"2012-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":126.13},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":137.52},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":141.37},{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":154.45},{"due_date":"2012-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":160.05},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":169.16},{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":179.47},{"due_date":"2012-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":186.64}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.88},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.35},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.12},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.71},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.19},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.21},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.35},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.85},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.79},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":44.88,"local_amount":117.09,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:32:49Z","rounded_local_amount":120.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263386519,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-16T17:38:38Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":392173,"name":"Khalid","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Khalid is a 33-year-old married man and a father of four children who lives in Taiz, Yemen.

She has 4 children, but only lives with 3 of them, who are 20, 15, and 14 years old.  She and her children live in her own house in the town of Kimiri, in the district and province of Chanchamayo.  Milka is a happy and enthusiastic mother.  Ten years ago she began a small food business.  Over the years, thanks to the good location of her home, which is in a tourist location that is visited by many foreign and local tourists, she has managed to adapt the location into a restaurant, where she sells traditional food dishes.  \"What sells the most are the chicken broth at breakfast time as well as the cracklings of pork and guinea pig (native jungle animals)\", she says.  Her prices vary from 10 to 30 soles.  But she adds that the people mainly eat foods that cost 12 to 20 soles.\r\nThe sales are not always good.  In the months of January and February they lessen, but they go up starting in March, especially in July and December.\r\nMilka is happy with her work, because she likes what she does.  Her dedication to the preparation of the food is the secret for getting the acceptance of her customers.  Now she hopes to remodel her business in order to make it more bright and eye-catching.  This will be her first loan that she obtains from MFP.  She feels very excited about joining the communal bank \"Virgen del Carmen\", where all the women are responsible.  For that reason she mentions that she will be punctual with the payment of her monthly dues.\r\nWith the money from the loan, she will buy new plates, more utensils like spoons, forks, and pots, as well as ingredients for the preparation of her typical dishes.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":29.24,"image":{"id":1003745,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"buy spoons, forks, pots, and dishes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-02-16T03:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-17T03:30:04Z","loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gloria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":77.98},{"due_date":"2012-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":84},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":85.32},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":91.59},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":94.13},{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":102.85},{"due_date":"2012-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":106.58},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":112.65},{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":119.52},{"due_date":"2012-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":125.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.24},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.34},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.3},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.57},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.97},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.24},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.82},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.02}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":29.24,"local_amount":77.98,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:31:27Z","rounded_local_amount":78.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263386522,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-23T17:40:54Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":392278,"name":"Takhmina","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0422\u0430\u0445\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043c \u0438 \u043b\u044e\u0431\u044f\u0449\u0430\u044f \u043c\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0442\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0445 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0446\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043c\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438 \u0434\u043e\u0431\u0440\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0449\u0438\u043d\u0430. \u0411\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0435 3 \u043b\u0435\u0442  \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043a\u0443\u043f\u043b\u0435- \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0436\u0435\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0443\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u043f\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u044f\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0432\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0446\u0435\u043c \u0431\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0430, \u0430 \u043c\u0443\u0436 \u0435\u0439 \u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0433\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0432 \u0442\u043e\u0440\u0433\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0435 \u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043a\u0438 \u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0432. \u041f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043c\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0443\u043a\u0442\u044b, \u043a\u043e\u043b\u0431\u0430\u0441\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0438\u0437\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0438\u044f \u0438 \u043d\u0430\u043f\u0438\u0442\u043a\u0438. \u0422\u0430\u0445\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0445\u043e\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0430 \u0431\u044b \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0437\u0430\u0439\u043c \u0432 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0435 8000 \u0421\u043e\u043c\u043e\u043d\u0438 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0435\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0432 \u0441 \u0446\u0435\u043b\u044c\u044e \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0448\u0438\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0431\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0430.","en":"Takhmina is married and is a loving mother of three children.

This family live in their own home in the indigenous community of Palomar, in R\u00edo Negro district, in Satipo province.  Claudio is a man who never rests.  He maintains an entrepreneurial and persistent attitude faced with any eventuality.  He started working the land together with his parents and, now that he has his own family, he also works as a farmer.  Claudio owns four plots of land on which he grows coffee, cacao, corn and bananas, his priority being the coffee and cacao.  Thanks to the variety of crops he grows, he is able to make income for his family.  Farming work is tiring and it keeps him busy all year.\r\n\r\nClaudio is anxiously awaiting his corn harvests which begin in February and his coffee harvests which will be ready between March and July.  His sales are immediate.  He sells his crops in the wholesale market in Pichanaki.  He already knows who to trade with and how much to sell for.  His four years of experience have enabled him to identify serious buyers.  Claudio will expand his plantings, acquiring more plots of land within a year.  \r\n\r\nThis will be the second time that Claudio has received a loan thanks to the help of MFP.  For this reason, he pledges to be punctual in making his monthly repayments.  He confirms that he feels happy to belong to his community bank, which is called \"Los Kontonas de Palomar\".  Claudio will use the money that he receives to sow one 'cuadra' (measurement of agricultural land) with coffee.  He already has the seedlings and will pay the laborers who he will hire to do the sowing."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1003843,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to hire laborers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-02-16T10:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-17T10:30:03Z","loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Claudio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-02-20T15:47:46Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":392467,"name":"Serigne  Mamadou","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Monsieur Serigne Mamadou est \u00e2g\u00e9 de 33 ans et habite dans une des localit\u00e9s du S\u00e9n\u00e9gal.
