While it is not a large enterprise, it is the business that has really helped support the family. Her husband does not have a stable job and therefore no stable income, moreover, he very frequently helps Sahriati in running the stall. Sahriati and her husband are the only two members of their household since their children have married and moved out.  <p>\r\nThe DINARI Foundation's reach has expanded into her region, and Sahriati has gained their trust in order to obtain a loan from them.  The funds are to increase working capital, namely to shop for all the various needs of the food stall. The necessities for the stall are purchased daily at the market, whereas the light snacks are purchased twice a week. The net proceeds each day can reach Rp. 100,000 (~ US$13) if there is a good crowd of customers and especially when fish are plentiful by the docks. Thankfully the stall is located near the docks, which enable them to source fish. From the stall's income Sahriati is able to lighten the load on her husband to provide for their family. \r\n\r\n <p><b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Aarati, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nSahriati sudah cukup lama menekuni usaha warung.Walaupun masih tergolong kecil, namun itulah yang menjadi usaha yang sangat membantu pendapatan keluarga. Suaminya tidak mempunyai pekerjaan tetap sehingga tidak mempunyai penghasilan tetap, bahkan suami sering kali membantu Sahriati dalam menjalan usaha warungnya. Saat ini Sahriati hanya tinggal dengan suami saja sebab anaknya sudah semua menikah.\r\nPelayanan Yayasan DINARI sampai di daerah tersebut dan akhirnya Sahriati mendapat kepercayaan dan memperoleh dana pinjaman. Dengan dana pinjaman tersebut dipakai untuk menambah modal usahanya yaitu untuk berbelanja segala keperluan usaha warung makannya. Untuk berbelanja kebutuhan warungnya dilakukan setiap hari dipasar, berbelanja makan ringan  biasanya dilakukan dalam satu minggu dua kali. Keuntungan bersih dalam sehari mencapai Rp.100.000.-  jika situasi sedang ramai pelanggan, terutama pada musim banyak ikan di dermaga. Kebetulan lokasi warungnya berada didekat dermaga ikan. Dari keuntungan inilah Sahriati dapat meringankan beban suaminya untuk menambah pendapatan keluarganya."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":187787,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","use":"Increase the business\u2019s working capital in order to upgrade the level of service and the food selection in the stall","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2008-08-08T09:10:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sahriati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-08-22T11:47:22Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":1000000,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2008-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2008-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":200000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2008-09-22T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-29T07:22:36Z","rounded_local_amount":228192.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":334321,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":25,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2008-10-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-11-16T08:42:02Z","rounded_local_amount":228192.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":368755,"comment":"scheduled_repayment (late autopay posting for DINARI Foundation - Oct 22, 2008)"},{"amount":25,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2008-11-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-19T08:05:15Z","rounded_local_amount":228192.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5308520,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-22T08:55:53Z","rounded_local_amount":228192.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9925446,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-07T09:02:23Z","rounded_local_amount":228192.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14849743,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-08-08T11:47:22Z","paid_date":"2009-03-07T09:02:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":59123,"name":"Girah","description":{"languages":["id"],"texts":{"id":"Although situated in a coastal area, Girah does lose heart about her work.

The Kiva loans will be divided among the group to pay back. \r\n\r\nWe thank you for your support on behalf of Sonia, the La Union Hace la Fuerza group, and the entire team at Esperanza International."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":187954,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","use":"Myrlanda Pierre will use this loan to purchase rice, beans, oil, soup, and other basic necessities for her colmado (a convenient store).","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"DO","country":"Dominican Republic","town":"Puerto Plata","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"19.75 -70.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":44,"posted_date":"2008-09-01T07:07:55Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Myrlanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jertha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Titon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adamise","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adriana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"DOP","disbursal_amount":5000,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2008-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2008-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":833.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2008-10-15T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-16T07:09:07Z","rounded_local_amount":862.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":360823,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":25,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2008-11-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T03:06:51Z","rounded_local_amount":862.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5312847,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2008-12-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T20:19:02Z","rounded_local_amount":862.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9930394,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2009-01-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T11:49:11Z","rounded_local_amount":862.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14854968,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2009-02-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:10:38Z","rounded_local_amount":862.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20394250,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":833.35,"processed_date":"2009-03-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T17:54:22Z","rounded_local_amount":862.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27085914,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-09-01T08:46:40Z","paid_date":"2009-04-15T17:54:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":59233,"name":"Obi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Obi I. is 31 years old and he is single.

She has a livestock stable that provides her with income and, most of all, the ability to improve her family\u2019s financial situation.  She is the mother to a three-year old son, who is her reason for being.  Ten years ago she decided to use a small amount of capital to buy two bulls which she raised and fattened.  She was then able to sell them at a higher price which allowed her, over time, to increase her working capital.

She works seven days a week from 9:00 in the morning until 5:00 in the afternoon.  She has a stall in the market in San Martin Jilotepeque to sell during the market days, Thursdays and Sundays.  The other days of the week she sells from the street near the market.  Although there are various similar food sales, Ana Andrea\u2019s is particularly successful because of the good variety and quality of her food.  Additionally, the majority of the food shops close earlier, but because Ana Andrea stays open until 5 she takes advantage of the opportunity to serve a lot of clients that eat later in the day.\r\n<p>\r\nAna Andrea is requesting this loan to buy more pigs and chickens, which she buys when they are small, fattens them up, and then later uses them for the food she sells.  This is a very economical way to provide her own meat for her food, and she needs more capital to purchase additional animals, food for them, and other things that she uses in preparing her food, such as noodles, vegetables, etc.  Ana Andrea is married and her husband is a farmer, growing corn and beans.  They have seven grown children and ten grandchildren.  Ana Andrea did not have the opportunity to go to school when she was younger and cannot read and write.  Nevertheless, she is very hardworking and has built a very successful business, which she dreams of continuing to expand.  With the help of this loan she can continue investing in her business and she hopes to increase her income to make some improvements to her house.  \r\n<p>\r\n<b>Translated from Spanish by Megan Montgomery, Kiva Fellow.<\/b>\r\n<p>\r\nAna Andrea ha estado preparando y vendiendo almuerzos t\u00edpicos guatemaltecos por m\u00e1s que 30 a\u00f1os.  Trabaja siete d\u00edas de la semana de las 9:00 de la ma\u00f1ana hasta las 5:00 de la tarde.  Tiene un local en el mercado en San Mart\u00edn Jilotepeque para vender durante los d\u00edas del mercado, los jueves y los domingos.  Los otros d\u00edas de la semana ella vende en la calle cerca del mercado.  Aunque hay varias ventas de comida semejantes, la de Ana Andrea es particularmente exitosa porque tiene buena variedad y calidad de sus comidas.  Adem\u00e1s, la mayor\u00eda de las ventas de comida cierren mas temprano, pero porque Ana Andrea queda abierta hasta las 5, aprovecha la oportunidad de servir a muchas clientes que coman mas tarde.   \r\n<p>\r\nAna Andrea esta pidiendo este pr\u00e9stamo para comprar m\u00e1s marranos y pollos, los que compra cuando est\u00e1n peque\u00f1os, los engorda, y despu\u00e9s los usa para su comida que venta.  Este es una manera muy econ\u00f3mica de proveer su propia carne para su comida y necesita capital para comprar m\u00e1s animales, la comida para ellos, y otras cosas que se usa en la preparaci\u00f3n de la comida, como fideos, verduras, etc.  Ana Andrea es casada y su esposo es agricultor, cultivando ma\u00edz y fr\u00edjol.  Tienen siete hijos que ya son grandes y diez nietos.  Ella no ten\u00eda la oportunidad de estudiar cuando estaba joven y no puede leer ni escribir.  Sin embargo, ella es muy trabajadora y ha creado un negocio muy exitoso, y sue\u00f1a con seguir aument\u00e1ndolo.

Today she is still selling women's clothing in the central market of her city. She charges only 50% extra on each piece of clothing, which has become one of the best attractions in her business. Olga has about $2,000 invested in merchandise, and her net profit is about $400 each month. Her affordable pricing policy causes good turnover of her inventory and brings Olga high profits. \r\n\r\nOlga is seeking a 2000 Grivna ($450) loan to increase her turnover and sales rates. Olga started this business when she couldn't find any other way to support herself and her family, so this venture is just like her baby, and she is very excited to see it expand and become sustainable. Olga is hoping to make good money in business and eventually do some repairs to her family's house."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":188536,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To increase her stock and turnover","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UA","country":"Ukraine","town":"Simferopol","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"44.95 34.1","type":"point"}},"partner_id":26,"posted_date":"2008-08-08T16:40:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Olga","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-08-23T01:09:32Z","disbursal_currency":"UAH","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2008-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2008-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":113,"local_amount":502.22,"processed_date":"2008-09-11T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-13T07:13:32Z","rounded_local_amount":522.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323187,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":113,"local_amount":502.22,"processed_date":"2008-10-11T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-24T07:08:15Z","rounded_local_amount":522.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355578,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":111.5,"local_amount":495.56,"processed_date":"2008-11-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T06:05:47Z","rounded_local_amount":515.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5323160,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T23:22:29Z","rounded_local_amount":520.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9942489,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-08-09T01:09:32Z","paid_date":"2009-01-15T23:22:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":59483,"name":"Rebecca","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rebecca O. is 42 years old and is married with four children.

He is 43 years old and married with two kids. He sells bananas and fresh eggs. He buys his supplies from Volta in the south eastern part of Ghana and from poultry farms around Tema. He enjoys his trade very much but the prices of his commodities and transport have gone up due to the current fuel crisis. This has rendered his capital inadequate so he can't purchase appreciable quantities to sell. He therefore needs the loan to inject additional capital into his business so he meet the demands of the market.

weaves huipiles (the typical dress of Guatemala women) by hand and raises chickens, ducks, and turkeys.  She has woven since she was a little girl, but with more simple patterns.  Five years ago she began to weave really detailed and fancy huipiles, such as for weddings.  These cost a lot to weave, not only in terms of thread, but also, more than anything, in terms of time.  She works for up to two or three months on one huipil, but she can sell them in the city of Antigua Guatemala for 3,000 to 3,700 Guatemala Quetzals (US$400-500), depending on the quality and level of detail.  Alejandra is very talented and weaves very beautiful huipiles.  \r\n<p>\r\nShe is requesting this loan to purchase more thread for weaving her huipiles and to buy more chickens and turkeys, food for them, and medicine to prevent illnesses.  She also would like to make improvements to the shelter where she keeps them, such as constructing better walls and buying more corrugated tin to better protect them from the rain.  Right now she has one cow in addition to a bunch of chickens, ducks, and turkeys.  When they are big she takes them to the market in the nearby city of San Martin Jilotepeque for sale.\r\n<p>\r\nAlejandra is married and her husband works in construction in Guatemala City.  They have six children ranging in age from six to twenty-one years old.  All of her children have studied or are currently studying, but only up to the sixth grade because of a lack of economic resources.  Her oldest son just got married in February and, while this was a very happy occasion, it cost a lot, so this loan would help Alejandra a lot right now, as resources are currently a little tight.  This is her first loan with FAPE and she is really excited to have the opportunity to invest in her businesses.  She notes that if she doesn\u2019t have thread, she can\u2019t work, so she needs this loan right away to help her continue working.  \r\n<p>\r\nAlejandra has many dreams for her businesses and her family.  She wants to expand her businesses enough to increase her income to be able to pay for more school for her children and to be able to buy more necessities for them, such as shoes and better clothing.  More than anything she dreams that her children study, find jobs, prosper, and get ahead in life.  \r\n<p>\r\n<b>Translated from Spanish by Megan Montgomery, Kiva Fellow.<\/b>\r\n<p>\r\nAlejandra teje g\u00fcipiles (el vestido t\u00edpico de mujeres en Guatemala) a mano y cr\u00eda pollos, patos, y chompipes.

Estos cuestan mucho para tejer, no solo en t\u00e9rminos de hilo sino, m\u00e1s que nada, en tiempo.  Ella trabaja por hasta dos o tres meses en un g\u00fcipil, pero los puede vender en la ciudad de Antigua Guatemala por 3.000 a 3.700 Quetzales Guatemaltecos (aproximadamente $400-500), dependiendo de la calidad y nivel de detalle.

Tienen seis hijos de edades desde seis a veintiuno a\u00f1os.  Todos sus hijos han estudiado o est\u00e1n estudiando, pero solamente hasta el sexto b\u00e1sico por falta de recursos econ\u00f3micos.  Su hijo m\u00e1s grande acaba de casarse en Febrero, y aunque este era una ocasi\u00f3n muy feliz, cost\u00f3 mucho, entonces ahora este pr\u00e9stamo la ayudar\u00eda much\u00edsimo en este momento, porque tiene pocos recursos ahora.  Este es su primer pr\u00e9stamo de FAPE, y est\u00e1 muy emocionada de tener la oportunidad de invertir en sus negocios.  Dice que si no tiene hilo, no puede trabajar, entonces necesita el pr\u00e9stamo ahorita para ayudarle en seguir trabajando.  \r\n<p>\r\nAlejandra tiene muchos sue\u00f1os para sus negocios y para su familia.

Thi Yen's family relied mainly on farming and raising a small number of livestock to earn a living, because she did not have enough capital and her children were still small. In 1994, the TYM Fund expanded to Phu Minh village and she became one of the members. Her first loan was 300.000VND (about 20USD) to purchase 3 pigs to breed, which yielded a small profit. Over the years, she continued to borrow to expand the pig sty and purchase more chickens, pigs and geese to breed and sell to other villagers. She also reared pigs to sell to butchers. Every year, her annual income from raising livestock and poultry was about 40,000,000VND (about 2667USD). Currently, she has 200 pigs and hundreds of chickens, geese and ducks. Her family's economy has improved tremendously thanks to the loans through the TYM Fund. Her family has become the model of raising livestock in Phu Minh village. Mrs Yen hopes that the TYM Fund will continue to reach out and provide help for the poor who do not have enough capital to improve their quality of life. This time, she would like to borrow 19,000,000VND (1,150USD) to invest in raising livestock and poultry. Her family's average monthly income is 7,000,000VND (about 466USD).\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Vietnamese by Pham Yen Thanh, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nC\u0169ng nh\u01b0 bao gia \u0111\u00ecnh n\u00f4ng d\u00e2n kh\u00e1c trong x\u00e3 Ph\u00fa Minh, gia \u0111\u00ecnh ch\u1ecb Kh\u1ed5ng Th\u1ecb Y\u1ebfn ch\u1ee7 y\u1ebfu l\u00e0m ru\u1ed9ng v\u00e0 ch\u0103n nu\u00f4i nh\u1ecf l\u1ebb, b\u1edfi ch\u1ecb kh\u00f4ng c\u00f3 v\u1ed1n \u0111\u1ea7u t\u01b0 ch\u0103n nu\u00f4i v\u00e0 khi \u0111\u00f3 c\u00e1c con v\u1eabn nh\u1ecf.

Thi Ly's family relied on mainly farming and raising livestock for a living. Even though Mrs. Ly's house was right next to the People's Representative Office of Tan Minh village and enjoyed the high accessibility from other villages, she still faced poverty because of her lack of capital. In 1996, she joined the TYM Fund and borrowed 300,000VND (18.50USD) to invest in breeding pigs and chickens. The profit was not high but she continued to use the subsequent loans to raise livestock. In 1998, the road connecting the centre of Soc Son town and Tan Minh village was upgraded and paved. Seeing the opportunity for business, her family opened a breakfast restaurant and cafe, thus their income has been increasing and Mrs. Ly has been able to accumulate an amount of capital. In 2005, with the profits made and borrowed money from her relatives, she was able to build a 3-storey house and expand her restaurant. Her family's average monthly income from livestock and the restaurant is about 4,500,000VND (about 300USD). This time, she would like to borrow 19,000,000VND (1,150.00USD) to invest in her restaurant and cafe.\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Vietnamese by Pham Yen Thanh, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nL\u00e0 m\u1ed9t gia \u0111\u00ecnh thu\u1ea7n n\u00f4ng, v\u1edbi 7 s\u00e0o ru\u1ed9ng n\u00ean kinh t\u1ebf gia \u0111\u00ecnh ch\u1ecb ch\u1ee7 y\u1ebfu tr\u00f4ng v\u00e0o \u0111\u1ed3ng ru\u1ed9ng v\u00e0 ch\u0103n nu\u00f4i th\u00eam l\u1ee3n, g\u00e0.

With the accumulated capital over the years, her family has been borrowing the maximum amounts allowed to invest in raising livestock and selling grocery such as vegetable, meat, fish, eggs... and breakfast foods for the army units in the area. She also has a cafe in the Ny market. Her husband works as a school guard with the monthly income of 1,500,000VND (about 94USD), which also helps the family in repaying the loans weekly.

Hoa","description":{"languages":["vi"],"texts":{"vi":"Minh Phu is a partially mountainous area. The portion of soil suitable for farming is very small, thus, the people in this village is the poorest as compared to other villages in Soc Son. Before joining the TYM Fund, Mrs. N. Thi Hoa's family was one of the poorest, as their income came from just a small area of farm land and a few chickens. She wanted to purchase a cow to facilitate farming but did not have enough money. It was even more difficult to improve her family's economy. In 1998, she discussed with her husband and joined the TYM Fund to start borrowing money. Her first loan of 1,000,000VND (about 64USD) was used to breed ducks and pigs. After a while, her family's economy slowly improved, and the more important thing is that she was able to accumulate an amount of capital. Since 2003, she has always been borrowing the maximum amounts allowed to expand her model of breeding ducks and pigs, so her family's economy has continued to improve further. Currently, she has 10 pigs waiting to be sold to butchers and about 500 pigs giving eggs everyday so it is convenient for her to repay the loan. Her monthly income from raising livestock is about 5,500,000VND (about 354USD), part of it is used for her family's spending, so she has purchased enough basic household equipments. She could also afford to construct a concrete house and is now preparing to build a second storey. This time, she would like to borrow 19,000,000VND (1,150.00USD) to invest in raising livestock.\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Vietnamese by Pham Yen Thanh, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nMinh Ph\u00fa l\u00e0 v\u00f9ng \u0111\u1ea5t b\u00e1n s\u01a1n \u0111\u1ecba, ru\u1ed9ng \u0111\u1ea5t tr\u1ed3ng l\u00faa \u00edt ch\u1ee7 y\u1ebfu l\u00e0 \u0111\u1ea5t g\u00f2 \u0111\u1ed3i n\u00ean cu\u1ed9c s\u1ed1ng c\u1ee7a ng\u01b0\u1eddi d\u00e2n n\u01a1i \u0111\u00e2y kh\u00e1 v\u1ea5t v\u1ea3 v\u00e0 ngh\u00e8o nh\u1ea5t huy\u1ec7n.

Her husband, a military M., was also stationed far from home and her children were young and still attending school. \r\n\r\n<p>She joined the TYM Fund in 1994 and borrowed 200,000 VND for her first loan to purchase pigs for rearing. There was no profit from the first year of rearing pigs because she did not own many pigs. But the following year, with the help of money from the TYM Fund, she expanded the pig pen and purchased more pigs. Each herd of pigs she raises consists of 25 to 30 pigs and each year she raises 3 herds for income after operating expenses of about 25,000,000 VND. In this way, her family has been able to improve their financial situation - she has been able to purchase household items for her family and specially has even been able to purchase a piece of land (100 square meters) right on street 131, which will be convenient for business and trade in the future.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Currently, she is still raising pigs and chicken to further improve the family\u2019s financial situation. In the pen, there are about 30 pigs preparing for economic conversion. Her husband is now stationed closer to home and receives a salary of 3,000,000 VND, which also provides a lot of support for her. Because of that, they are able to repay weekly rather successfully. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>She wants to continue to participate in the Fund for a long time to raise money to improve economically. For this loan, she would like to raise 19,000,000 VND to invest in her animal rearing business. The family\u2019s average income is 5,000,000 VND per month. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Vietnamese by Catherine Tran, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><\/p>\r\n\r\nTr\u01b0\u1edbc khi ch\u01b0a tham gia Qu\u1ef9 ch\u1ecb l\u00e0m ru\u1ed9ng l\u00e0 ch\u1ee7 y\u1ebfu c\u00f2n ch\u0103n nu\u00f4i nh\u1ecf l\u1ebb v\u00ec kh\u00f4ng c\u00f3 v\u1ed1n \u0111\u1ea7u t\u01b0 ch\u0103n nu\u00f4i, h\u01a1n n\u1eefa ch\u1ed3ng ch\u1ecb l\u00e0 b\u1ed9 \u0111\u1ed9i l\u1ea1i xa nh\u00e0, c\u00e1c con c\u00f2n nh\u1ecf v\u00e0 \u0111ang \u0111i h\u1ecdc.

From then on, her family has been borrowing to invest further in raising pigs and chickens. Each year, she can sell 3 rounds of pigs and 4 rounds of chickens, gaining annual profit of about 20,000,000VND (about 1333USD). Her children are also working to help her repay the loan weekly. Her family's average monthly income is 5,000,000VND (about 333USD). This time, she would like to borrow 16,000,000VND (975.00USD) to purchase animal feeds and more female pigs to breed.\r\n<b><p>Translated from Vietnamese by Pham Yen Thanh, Kiva volunteer.<\/p><\/b>\r\n\r\nTr\u01b0\u1edbc khi ch\u01b0a tham gia qu\u1ef9 gia \u0111\u00ecnh ch\u1ecb Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb Ti\u1ec1n  ch\u1ee7 y\u1ebfu l\u00e0m n\u00f4ng nghi\u1ec7p, ho\u00e0n c\u1ea3nh kinh t\u1ebf kh\u00f3 kh\u0103n, c\u00e1c con c\u00f2n nh\u1ecf.\r\n\tN\u0103m 1995 ch\u1ecb tham gia c\u1ee5m 15 th\u00f4n \u0110\u1ed3ng L\u1ea1c v\u00e0 \u0111\u01b0\u1ee3c vay 500.000 \u0111\u1ed3ng s\u1eed d\u1ee5ng v\u00e0o ch\u0103n nu\u00f4i l\u1ee3n, k\u1ec3 t\u1eeb \u0111\u00f3 \u0111\u1ebfn nay gia \u0111\u00ecnh ch\u1ecb lu\u00f4n vay v\u1ed1n c\u1ee7a qu\u1ef9 \u0111\u1ec3 \u0111\u1ea7u t\u01b0 v\u00e0o ch\u0103n nu\u00f4i l\u1ee3n n\u00e1i, l\u1ee3n th\u1ecbt v\u00e0 ch\u0103n nu\u00f4i g\u00e0, m\u1ed7i n\u0103m cho xu\u1ea5t chu\u1ed3ng 3 l\u1ee9a l\u1ee3n v\u00e0 4 l\u1ee9a g\u00e0 ta, thu nh\u1eadp t\u1eeb ch\u0103n nu\u00f4i kho\u1ea3ng 20.000.000 \u0111\u1ed3ng\/n\u0103m.

Thi Ly's family relied only on farming and raised a small number of livestock which took advantage of scrap food and side products of farming. Her family's economy at that point of time was only the average in Tan Trai village. In 1995, Mrs. Ly joined the TYM Fund and borrowed the first loan of 500,000VND (about 33USD), which she used to purchase a female pig to breed. It brought about a profit of more than 1,000,000VND (about 66USD). As a creative and active woman, Mrs. Ly had tried many businesses such as buying and selling general goods and opening an eatery in Phu Cuong market, which all yielded good profit. However, she realised that raising livestock in large scale would return higher profit. Therefore, she discussed with her husband and moved into raising a large number of livestock. Her subsequent loans were all large in amount, from 16,000,000VND to 19,000,000VND. She bought 25-30 pigs each time and each year she raised and bred them 3 times, gaining profit from 10 millions to 15 millions VND. Currently, she has 2 female pigs to breed and 30 pigs to sell, along with hundreds of chickens. Thus, her family's monthly income reaches 7 millions VND (about 466USD). This time, she would like to borrow 18 millions VND (1,100.00USD) to invest in raising livestock.\r\n<b><p>Translated from Vietnamese by Pham Yen Thanh, Kiva volunteer.<\/p><\/b> \r\nTr\u01b0\u1edbc khi ch\u01b0a tham gia Q\u0169y T\u00ecnh Th\u01b0\u01a1ng,  gia \u0111\u00ecnh ch\u1ecb Tr\u1ea7n Th\u1ecb L\u00fd ch\u1ec9 l\u00e0m n\u00f4ng nghi\u1ec7p v\u00e0 ch\u0103n nu\u00f4i nh\u1ecf nh\u1eb1m t\u1eadn d\u1ee5ng th\u1ee9c \u0103n d\u01b0 th\u1eeba v\u00e0 c\u00e1c s\u1ea3n ph\u1ea9m ph\u1ee5 t\u1eeb n\u00f4ng nghi\u1ec7p, kinh t\u1ebf gia \u0111\u00ecnh ch\u1ecb khi \u0111\u00f3 v\u00e0o lo\u1ea1i trung b\u00ecnh c\u1ee7a th\u00f4n T\u00e2n Tr\u1ea1i.

She also participates enthusiastically in the activities organised by the Fund. After 6 years of borrowing to invest in buying and renting tractors and other farming equipments to meet the demand of the people around the area, her family's economy has improved. Apart from renting, Mrs. Ngoc also sells general goods in the market to increase her family's income. She has just built a new house and is able to send all her children to school. This time, she would like to borrow 15,000,000VND (900USD) to purchase more tractors and ploughs to rent out.
