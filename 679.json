is a married man with three children, two of whom attend school, while one is still too young for school. He lives at a rental house that has neither electricity nor piped water. His greatest monthly expenses are food and school fees.\r\n\r\nFor the past three years, he has operated a tuk-tuk (three-wheeled motor vehicle) business, operating between home and the market.

Samvel has been leasing a shop since 1999, where he has been involved in processing wood.  He buys wood from the Ijevan forestry and uses it to make parquet flooring, box details, floor plinths and also fills private orders.  Samvel sells his products in Ijevan, Yerevan and also sells them to his loyal customers from Hoktemberyan and Echmiadzin districts.  Thanks to this business, Samvel is able to provide for his family.  He needs a loan in the sum of 900 000 dram to buy an inventory of wood and a woodworking machine.

She has been a tailor, selling bed sheets and fabrics, since 2009.  She works from 8 a.m to 8 p.m daily and is able to make a good monthly profit.  \r\n\r\nThis will be her 5th loan from Tujijenge Tanzania.  She used the previous loans to buy a roll of cotton material for bedsheets and dress making, opened a shop for the tailoring business, paid school fees, and paid for the shop rent.  She has paid back all her loans successfully.  She wants a loan to buy 6 rolls of cotton materials and sewing items. (Normally a good cotton roll contains about 120 meters.)  Her dream is to one day be able to buy a motor cycle and give it to her husband who will use it for the transport business.\r\n\r\nShe will share this loan with her loan group \"Spider\", which has a total of 15 members who will hold each other accountable for paying back their loans.

They live in the Malindi area of Coast Province. Her business is in the heart of a small town and she has a number of customers. Among the coastal people who like nice dresses, she does good business. \n\nAlice was invited to join Milango Financial Services by her friends in May, 2011. A loan of 40,000 Kenyan shillings will help Alice buy new stock of clothes, shoes and sufurias (cooking pots). She hopes to improve her business, obtain a larger loan, and build her own business premises, because she rents the current premises. Just like in other tourist destination towns, her business faces a low season in February when there are few sales, but she advises fellow ladies to join Milango in order to obtain credit to improve

She runs an Internet caf\u00e9, variety store and packaging service; she\u2019s been in business for three years.\r\n\r\nShe comments that in her location she has 8 computers, she sells cell phone recharge time, vehicle transportation cards (Transantiago) and she also provides other services.  Her store is located in the front yard of her mother-in-law\u2019s house.\r\n\r\nShe buys her products directly from distributors and suppliers since she needs supplies like CDs for photos and for music.\r\n\r\nShe will use the loan to buy a photocopier since the one she had was in pretty bad shape.  Her goals are to expand her locale or rent a bigger one to add more computers; she hopes to have 15 PCs.\r\n\r\nShe lives with her husband and two children who are 11 and 7 years old.  Her dream on a personal level is to take a trip around her country.\r\n\r\nShe is very happy with and grateful for the services provided by Fondo Esperanza because it\u2019s provided her with the opportunity to invest in her business and to grow as a person.\r\n\r\nThe group of the communal bank she\u2019s a member of is very united, mutually supportive and responsible.  With respect to the training, she\u2019s learned bookkeeping to better manage her business.\r\n\r\nPe\u00f1alol\u00e9n is located to the east of the metropolitan region.

When she acquires the animal in the city, she walks some five kilometers from the place she buys it to her house.\r\n\r\nRuth is requesting a loan from the Campo Foundation to buy livestock to raise.  If she buys heifers, she will buy three; but if she decides to buy dairy cows, she will buy only one, since they are more expensive than heifers.  With the loan she is trying to to increase the milk production and in this way be able to process it to sell dairy products.  She has seen the opportunity to have good income, since people are already looking for dairy products at her house and she doesn't have them available yet.\r\n\r\nRuth's plan for the future is to make improvements to her house, depending on the production and raising of her livestock.

The milk is sold to the Pil Andina firm.  He also makes cheese that he then sells at the Colcapirhua market.   He currently has nine head of dairy cattle that he gets about 90 liters of daily production from.\r\n\r\nThe loan he\u2019s asking for is to buy a milk cooling tank (The cooling tank is a storage unit to keep raw milk in good condition.  This is the tank that the Pil firm collects the milk from every morning and afternoon).  Its price is between US$13,000 to US$16,000 and this is why the purchase is being made together with 15 other people from the same community; each one is putting in US$1,000.  By having a cooling tank closer to home, \u00c1ngel will be able to store more of his milk in it and perhaps be able to stop selling cheese which takes up a lot of his time.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":166.68,"image":{"id":879488,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to pay his share in a milk cooling tank.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Cochabamba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.383333 -66.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":140,"posted_date":"2011-09-27T18:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Angel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":41.59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.59}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":41.67,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:35:39Z","rounded_local_amount":41.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244535125,"comment":null},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":41.67,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:43:38Z","rounded_local_amount":41.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250744686,"comment":null},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":41.67,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-17T08:54:37Z","rounded_local_amount":41.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257540223,"comment":null},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":41.67,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-21T07:36:30Z","rounded_local_amount":41.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":264339795,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-09-28T02:30:16Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":340311,"name":"David Ulises","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Se\u00f1or David es casado, tiene 29 a\u00f1os de edad, vive en la ciudad de Pilar, tiene casa propia, donde posee las condiciones b\u00e1sicas para desarrollar sus actividades dentro del seno familiar y movilidad propia para hacerlo, consistente en una moto.\n\u00c9l se dedica a la venta de ropas, vaqueros y otro tipo de prendas.

She works in her district market.

She lives with her partner and three children, ages 5, 4, and 10 months.  They live together in their own home.  She makes her living selling dried fish, a food that is in demand by the people in her city.  She obtains this fish from the Ucayali River, and then dries and salts it so that it may be preserved over time. Then she sells it to shopkeepers.  She has been engaged in this occupation for five years and she and her husband make a good team.  She likes this job because it gives her time to take care of her children.  However, she runs a risk each time she goes to the river in search of fish because there are times when the currents flow strongly.  \r\n\r\nIn addition, she mentions that, in the future, she would like to embark on another activity: growing corn.  This will be her sixth loan with MFP and she hopes for the support of each one of you to carry out her job.  With the amount requested, she will buy seeds to start planting corn.

He is married and the father of three adult children. He went to school through the fourth grade but had to drop out because of financial difficulties. He lives in his own home with his family, and also supports three grandchildren, who lives with them.\r\nHe left Marpanha for Maputo to find a job. He is retired and his wife has owned a store for more than 21 years. He also has a pension. His wife earns about 8,800 meticals a month, which they use to cover household expenses. They are able to save a little in their bank account each month. He's never had loans from other banks. He learned about Hluvuku from coworkers who are also clients of the institution.

In this way, he started to gain experience as a driver. \r\n\r\nAt  the age of 18, he began to drive the trucks that transport wood to different parts of the country. He drives for five hours to deliver the shipments of wood. To do this, he has to load the truck in the evening from 6:00pm to 10:00pm. Once loaded, he leaves at 3:00am to drop off the wood. \r\n \r\nHe wishes to undertake this work on an independent basis; buying the wood and distributing it at better prices on his own. That is why he is applying to Fundaci\u00f3n Campo for a loan. In this way, he will receive a better income. It will be a great opportunity to continue working hard, and to provide his family with a better life; as he wants to save to buy his own truck, since his vision is to work independently. \r\n\r\nHe wishes to be an example for other young men, who with effort can achieve everything in life; they only have to work and set goals.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":263.13,"image":{"id":879864,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Wholesale","sector":"Wholesale","use":"To buy wood.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Moraz\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2011-09-29T06:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan Antonio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":800,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":36.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":35.49},{"due_date":"2011-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":37.62},{"due_date":"2012-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":37.98},{"due_date":"2012-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":38.95},{"due_date":"2012-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":40.95},{"due_date":"2012-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":40.98},{"due_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":42.46},{"due_date":"2012-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":43.11},{"due_date":"2012-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":44.57},{"due_date":"2012-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":45.34},{"due_date":"2012-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":46.79},{"due_date":"2012-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":47.69},{"due_date":"2012-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":48.91},{"due_date":"2012-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":50.5},{"due_date":"2013-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":51.3},{"due_date":"2013-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":52.75},{"due_date":"2013-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":58.11}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.5},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.49},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.62},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.98},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.95},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.95},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.98},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.46},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.11},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.57},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.34},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.79},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.69},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.91},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.5},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.3},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.75},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.11}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":38.46,"local_amount":38.46,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-16T09:06:20Z","rounded_local_amount":38.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238807069,"comment":null},{"amount":101.49,"local_amount":101.49,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:52:39Z","rounded_local_amount":101.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244562700,"comment":null},{"amount":80.3,"local_amount":80.3,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:16:16Z","rounded_local_amount":80.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257182410,"comment":null},{"amount":42.88,"local_amount":42.88,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:28:50Z","rounded_local_amount":42.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263317354,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-09-30T08:35:23Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":340429,"name":"Mujeres Maravilla Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La formaci\u00f3n de este comit\u00e9 fue gracias a la se\u00f1ora Adelaida, pues ella contact\u00f3 con sus amigas y vecinas del barrio y las organizo, y de all\u00ed surge el comit\u00e9.

She lives in Barrio La Hoya in the Juticalpa municipality, and sells rosquillas (a traditional treat similar to doughnuts) and quesadillas. \r\n\r\nSandra learned to make rosquillas and quesadillas more than 30 years ago. She trained by working with a neighbor who did this for a living. Her products are a great favorite of the residents of Juticalpa, and also of people who live in other countries; since the greatest amount of her production is bought to be sent to family members and friends who live in the United States. \r\n\r\nShe works together with her youngest son. Her working day begins at 4:00am, which is very demanding. But once the product leaves the oven, she can rest, and her son sends it out to the customers.  \r\n\r\nThe loan that Sandra is applying for is needed to buy milk, corn, sugar, firewood, eggs, and other products for making rosquillas and quesadillas. With the help of the loan Sandra, will be able to fill some orders that she hasn't yet delivered, and that will generate profits to cover some household expenses such as rent.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to have her own house; a very large one, because she wants to set up a small work area and teach people to make rosquillas and quesadillas. \r\n\r\nSandra feels very thankful for the loan support she has received, because this has helped her keep herself going financially. She is a client who is very punctual with her payments, and has already had four loans with FAMA."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400.01,"image":{"id":880640,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","use":"To buy corn, sugar, firewood, eggs, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Juticalpa, Olancho","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":168,"posted_date":"2011-09-30T21:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sandra Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":15000,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":133.33,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:53:47Z","rounded_local_amount":2517.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238589372,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-16T08:50:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1258.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244547469,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:52:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1258.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250758106,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-29T08:38:47Z","rounded_local_amount":1258.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257165390,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:18:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1258.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263297160,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-10-01T00:52:14Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":340534,"name":"Teryleny","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Teryleny, age 47, lives in a small home with her husband and one infant daughter.

Eleuteria and her husband manage their own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nEleuteria operates a business renting gowns and shoes. She buys second-hand gowns and shoes, and then offers them to others who would like to rent them on a daily basis. These gowns are used for special occasions and other formal gatherings. She also sells accessories for additional income. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and others in the local community. She earns a minimum of 320 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a loan for 8,000 PHP. She will be utilizing the loan to buy additional gowns and shoes to expand her inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nEleuteria hopes her business grows more in the coming years and dreams to be able to give her children a high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.

She is single and manages her own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nJulita operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 Philippines pesos (PHP) worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns income by purchasing supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Aside from this, Julita also earns extra income from the apartment rentals that she operates. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 480 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she requests a PHP 15,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n\r\nJulita hopes to grow her business more in the coming years and to help her family members who are in need.

Both of them attend kindergarten. Her family lives in their own ger, a traditional Mongolian felt tent, which is located in the outer ger district (a district without basic infrastructure) of Ulaanbaatar city, Mongolia. \r\n\r\nTsatsral has been supporting her family by operating a clothing retail stall at the largest outdoor market of Mongolia, for six years, with the help of her spouse.  She usually sells women's clothes, which she imports from Ereen, a border city between Mongolia and China. As she is a friendly person, she has already had her own constant customers. \r\n\r\nTsatsral wants to expand her business in order to increase her working capital.
