Eunice takes care of nine children at home. In the recent 2011 season, Eunice had an excellent maize yield harvesting 20 bags on one acre of land. Before joining One Acre Fund, Eunice was only able to harvest 8 bags of maize on one acre of land. She joined One Acre Fund in order to grow enough to feed her family and access fertilizer and hybrid seeds. With income from maize sales, Eunice will educate her children and invest in business.\r\n\r\nEunice is the facilitator of the Valentine Group. She is pictured with her group members in the photograph.This group joined One Acre Fund in the year 2011 and will re-enroll in the 2012 program. Like the majority of people in this part of Kenya, the members of Valentine Group are farmers who rely on maize production for annual food security and income. In 2012, the members of Valentine Group will each plant between \u00bd and one acre of maize.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, One Acre Fund will purchase fertilizer, seeds, and other important inputs to distribute to Eunice and her group during Kenya\u2019s next planting season in February 2012. The distribution of farming inputs is part of One Acre Fund\u2019s integrated agriculture package, which includes training, reliable input supply (such as fertilizer and seeds), credit and insurance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":897664,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to source farming inputs, such as seeds and fertilizer, at low prices for the 2012 planting season.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2011-11-20T01:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eunice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Josephine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Josephine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Justus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rabecca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wasike","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":63000,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":675}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2011-11-20T05:23:07Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":358241,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":""}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":603.25,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase more merchandise.","delinquent":true,"location":{"country_code":"AZ","country":"Azerbaijan","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"40.5 47.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":56,"posted_date":"2011-12-01T08:01:40Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"AZN","disbursal_amount":1800,"loan_amount":2300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2011-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2012-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2012-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2012-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2012-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2012-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2012-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2012-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2012-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2012-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":120}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":153.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":153.34},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":153.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":153.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":153.34},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":153.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":153.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":153.34},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":153.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":153.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":153.34},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":153.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":153.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":153.34},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":153.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":455.58,"local_amount":356.54,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:30:51Z","rounded_local_amount":358.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257117455,"comment":null},{"amount":147.67,"local_amount":115.57,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:29:25Z","rounded_local_amount":116.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263242563,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-12-31T21:44:30Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":358242,"name":"Ancille","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ancille is 23-years-old and is married.

She lives in the village of Velikaya Znamenka and sells men's and women's clothes at the local market. Viktoriya has two large, wide stalls, which allow her to expand her collection. The stalls are located in a very convenient spot in the market. As Znamenka is a small town, the market there is small as well and the biggest market is for inexpensive, practical clothing- just the type Viktoria offers.\r\n\r\nViktoriya has been trading in the market for 8 years. At this time, the income from her business is around 30,000 hryvnia. Her net income does not exceed 6,000 hryvnia per month. Viktoria would like to receive a Kiva loan of 15,000 to purchase a winter shipment of goods. Before the cold weather begins, this type of product is always in high demand.

She has invested 40,000 hrivna in her business. She spends around 17,000 hrivna a year on seeds and plastic covers.\r\n\r\nSvetlana plans to invest the 13,000 hrivna loan to build a new greenhouse to grow tomatoes. An additional spacy greenhouse will let her grow better quality tomatoes in larger quantities. In her short term goals Svetlana also wants to install heating equipment in her greenhouses which is becoming increasingly important in the run-up to cold winter. Thanks to the successful farming business Svetlana was able to buy a car this year to transport the tomatoes. Next year it should help her to sell the products.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":918953,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

They have four children, of which only two (their 20 and 18 year old) live with them.  This family lives in their own home in the district of Uni\u00f3n.  Maura is a crop farmer and grows vegetables such as rue, oregano and camomille which are plants that do not require much care, investment or time.  She explains, \"My business is constant when my crops are fully grown, I have to cut them, bind them in small packets and sell them for 0.50 cents each.\"  She says that raising this type of vegetable is easier because it grows, is cut, and grows again without having to spend money on fertilizer or workers to plough and clear the land, etc.  Previously these were issues that one constantly had to worry about.  Also, the income she earns makes it profitable since she has customers in the city of Lima where she travels constantly.  There she sells three packages of rue or camomille for 2 PEN, twice the price that she gets in Tarma.  The advantage is that the plants grow quickly and are harvested in large quantities.  In the future she hopes to buy or build a house in the city of Tarma where she and her husband can live since her children will have their own families.

This family lives in a cozy home in the district of Tapo.  Fredy learned about agriculture from his father and uncles who also live in this area which is known for its mineral-rich land.  This hard-working father grows peas, potatoes, lima beans, carrots, spinach, etc.  He also raises and sells livestock such as cows and donkeys.  He usually makes an average of 30 to 50 PEN per donkey and 150 to 200 PEN per cow.  \"The price of vegetables decreases sometimes and some can go bad over time, so I have to risk selling them at those prices.  But I have never lost money, somehow I always get a return on my investment\", he explains.  His wife helps him on the land by aerating it in the afternoons.  During planting or harvest season Fredy hires workers and pays them a daily wage.  He is able to save money this way so he can expand his house in the future.  \"I would like to add on more rooms for my children and other relatives\", he says.  This is his 8th loan through MFP.  He is very grateful to the entity for the enterprise opportunities he has had and he hopes to continue in this vein and is committed to paying back the loan on time.

He is 32 and a native of a town where the principal economic activity is guava cultivation. He is married and has two children, who are in primary school. He has worked, from a very young age, as a baker, but four years ago he branched out on his own in order to provide economically for his household and earn a bit more income. He notes that it was his family who taught him how to make different kinds of breads such as the delicious chilindrinas (sugar coated buns), doughnuts, conchas (sweet buns), espejos (large, glazed cookies ), teleras (a type of bread), cuernitos (croissants) and many other varieties. \r\n\r\nJorge says that he gets up at a very early hour, at about 4 in the morning, to do his baking. He sells his bread in the city, since various stores have already placed orders. He is asking for a loan to buy basic ingredients such as flour, milk, eggs, sugar, cooking gas, food coloring, etc. He says that, especially in the month of November, he makes bread for the Day of the Dead, since the Day of the Dead holiday is celebrated in the country.

She requested her loan to buy peanuts, brown sugar, cereal, sugar and honey so that she can have a better stock of supplies available with which to work.  Raquel Yolanda started her business 15 years ago.  In her town, everybody makes sweet treats and she was taught by her parents.  She started out with loans from the suppliers from whom she bought her merchandise.  She sells her sweet treats in the markets in the villages with pilgrims and visitors.  Her business is important.  She enjoys making her sweet treats and hopes to gain more of the market.  Her business provides her with the income she needs to cover all her needs.  The challenges that she faces in her business are the high prices of sugar and peanuts.  She is happy to be receiving this loan which she will use to buy raw materials so that she can continue working.  Her hopes and dreams are to grow her business and for her children to continue studying and achieve the goals they set for themselves.

In the recent 2011 season, Eliud had an excellent maize yield harvesting five bags on half an acre of land. Before joining One Acre Fund, Eliud was only able to harvest two bags of maize on that land. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, One Acre Fund will purchase fertilizer, seeds, and other important inputs to distribute to Eliud and his group during Kenya's next planting season in February 2012. The distribution of farming inputs such as fertilizer and seed is part of One Acre Fund's integrated agriculture package, which also includes training, credit, and insurance. \r\n\r\nWith the income from maize sales, Eliud will educate his children and invest in his business. \r\n\r\nIn 2012, the members of Amuka group will each plant maize plots between one half and one acre of land. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":918648,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy farming inputs, such as seeds and fertilizer, at low prices for the 2012 planting season.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2011-11-20T17:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Amos","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Betty","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eliud","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"John","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Robert","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sarah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":48300,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":525}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2011-12-18T08:48:32Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":358401,"name":"Saul","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Sa\u00fal, tiene la edad  de 65 a\u00f1os, est\u00e1 casado y vive con su esposa y sus 5 hijos que son su mayor prioridad.

This will allow her to improve and increase her income.\r\n\r\nShe tells us that all of her fellow group members are responsible people who fulfill their obligations and like to work in order to better themselves and overcome any obstacle.  As they've known each other for some time, she can say that they are people who repay their debts and do not cheat people who have placed their trust in them.\r\n\r\nAlicia thanks FRAC and Kiva on behalf of herself and her family because, thanks to them, she will be able to change her life, since they will now have a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nSome of Alicia's fellow group members are Felisc\u00edsima, Rosa, Teresa, \u00c1urea, Braulia, Reyna, Rafaela, and Juana, who do different things for a living, such as selling clothing, groceries, food, corn, bread, tamales, and Mexican

Monica is an exemplary mother and homemaker who opened her doors to us to confide in us about her life and activities. She owns crop lands in the local foothills on which she cultivates coffee and ginger. She sells her crops at the wholesale market in the city of Pichanaki. \"I try to balance my production so that my income can cover my necessities all year long, and we have prospered with both crops,\" Monica states. At the same time, Monica opened a small general store, which she has neglected because she needed to dedicate herself fully to agriculture. However, she hopes be able to restart that business in the future as a lack of capital was the obstacle that prevented its launching. Monica yearns to increase her coffee crop, but to do so, she must rent land and invest in fertilizer, plants, and labor. Once this plan becomes concrete, she will be able to offer her family a better quality of life. Thanks to your help, this will be the first time that she obtains a loan from MFP, which is why she commits to being punctual in making her repayments. Regarding her communal bank, she demonstrates a predisposition to become a member as soon as it is organized. Once she obtains the money, Monica will invest it in purchasing basic need items and other goods to sell in her business.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":919245,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase basic need items.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-11-16T23:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Monica ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2011-11-24T05:29:28Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":358437,"name":"Las Tres Estrellas Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\n      El  grupo se llama las  tres estrellas y este integrado de tres se\u00f1oras quienes viven en una localidad peque\u00f1a en donde se cosecha el durazno.\n La se\u00f1ora quien se le tomo la entrevista se llama Mar\u00eda Candelaria quien es casada  con el se\u00f1or Juan Gabriel y con quien procreo un hijo de la edad de un a\u00f1o y siete meses en la que vive en una casita muy humilde.\n\n    Ella es la  primera vez que solicita un pr\u00e9stamo y es para invertirlo en la compra de  cosm\u00e9ticos como son: cremas, desodorantes, perfumes, labiales, entre otros de la marca Avon.

Soltero y con planes claros para el futuro, vive en la casa de sus padres en la comunidad nativa San Pablo de Shaoriato. Desde que ten\u00eda 7 a\u00f1os ayudaba a sus padres en el campo, de esa manera aprendi\u00f3 sobre lo duro y gratificante que puede ser las jornadas.\nA sus 18 a\u00f1os ya cuenta con 2 lotes de terrenos de 20 por 15 metros cada uno. En ellos siembra kion y naranjas. Frutos que traslada hacia la ciudad de Pichanaki para su venta al por mayor inmediata, pues cuenta con compradores fijos. Pero deja una menor producci\u00f3n para expenderla al por menor.\n\u201cEl kilo de ki\u00f3n est\u00e1 a 1.50 soles y su cosecha es cada 7 u 8 meses, depende de los cuidados, abonamiento y limpieza\u201d, explica. Los suelos f\u00e9rtiles de su comunidad son propicios para el crecimiento y desarrollo de grandes y jugosos kiones. Adem\u00e1s los r\u00edos de la zona son cuna de card\u00famenes de peces. Rosendo caza y vende pescados como: \u201cChupadora\u201d \u201cBarb\u00f3n\u201d a los visitantes de su comunidad.

Posteriormente tendr\u00e1 su familia, pero no est\u00e1 en sus planes cercanos. Ser\u00eda la primera vez que Rosendo acceder\u00eda a un cr\u00e9dito de MFP. Se siente contento de pertenecer a su banco comunal. Por esa raz\u00f3n, da su palabra de ser puntual en el pago de las cuotas y responsable con las actividades dentro del grupo. De obtener el pr\u00e9stamo, Rosendo invertir\u00e1 en el pago de operarios que trabajar\u00e1n sus terrenos, en el \u201cporcado\u201d (acumulaci\u00f3n de la tierra alrededor de la planta), y  deshierbo (limpieza de sembr\u00edos).\n\n","en":"Rosendo, 18, is a hard-working young man with clear plans for the future.  He is single, and lives in his parents home in his native village of San Pablo de Shariato.  Since he was 7 he helped his parents in the fields and thus learned how hard and gratifying daily work can be.\r\n\r\nAt 18 he has 2 fields of 20 and 15 meters each.  Here he plants kions (a ginger-like tuber) and oranges, fruits that he transports to Pichanaki to sell wholesale right away to regular buyers but he also keeps a small amount to sell retail.\r\nHe says,  \"The kilo of kion is 1.50 sols and his harvest is every 7 or 8 months, depending on the care, fertilizing and weeding\".  The fertile soil in his community is favorable to the growth and development of big and juicy kions.  Also the rivers in his area are thick with schools of fish.  Rosendo fishes and sells fish called: \"Chupadora\", and \"Baron\", to the people who come to his village.  This young entrepreneur prioritizes his development as a person, increasing his planting and improving his production.  In the future he will have a family but this is not in his plans at the moment.  This will be the first time that Rosendo requests a loan with MFP.  He feels happy to belong to the communal bank.  Thus, he promises to be punctual in making the payments and responsible in the activities of the group.  He will use the loan to pay the people who work his fields, in the \u201cporcado\u201d (forming dirt around the plants) and in weeding (cleaning the crops).\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":919267,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to hire workers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-11-17T01:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosendo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2011-11-17T23:34:56Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":358444,"name":"Mazatl Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Grupo Mazatl esta integrado por trece mujeres, ellos viven en una comunidad lejana en la sima de un cerro, sus principales actividades economicas son el cultivo de cafe, naranja y maiz, la mayoria de los habitantes de esta comunidad hablan el dialecto Nahuatl y le han puesto el nombre de Mazatl a su grupo que es una palabra en nahuatl que significa Venado.\n\nLa se\u00f1ora Heriberta es uno de los integrantes de este grupo, ella tiene la edad de 45 a\u00f1os, solo estudio la primaria y esta casada con el se\u00f1or Victor que trabaja en el campo, ella tiene 4 hijos los cuales ya estan casados.\n\nDo\u00f1\u00f1a heriberta platica que siempre le ha gustado trabajar y hace un poco mas de 18 a\u00f1os decidio iniciar a trabajar en su propio negocio de venta de pollo para ganar un poco de dinero extra  y asi poder ayudar a su esposo con los gastos del hogar.\n\nElla realiza sus ventas todos los dias desde su hogar se levanta temprano para aliniar su pollo y saca una peque\u00f1a mesa la cual pone en la parte de enfrente de su casa y pone en una bandeja su pollo y conforme va pasando el dia sus clientes van a su negocio ha hacerle el gastos.\n\nella nececita este credito para invertirlo en la compra de pollos para ppoder realizar sus ventas. \n\nella dijo\"Gracias a la fundacion Realidad por venir hasta nuestra localidad a brindarnos estos prestamos\"\n\nTambien nos dijo que espera que con esta inversion su negocio prospere ya que le gustaria a que su negocio continue creciendo y iniciar a vender pan ya que deja buenas ganancias.\n\nLos demas integrantes del grupo son:\n\nLourdes venta de antojitos mexicanos\nImelda venta de abarrotes \nElodia Venta de reposteria \nEmma venta de pan \nBeatriz venta de pollo \nEnriqueta venta de pan \nMatilde venta de pollo\nGriselda venta de ropa \nFelicitas Venta de refresco \nMaria Geremias venta de pollo \nSusana Venta de refresco \nNicacia Venta de pan\n","en":"The \u201cMazatl\u201d group has 13 women members living in a distant community on a hilltop.

She is asking for a loan to buy flour, sugar, butter, eggs, vanilla, cinnamon and firewood with which to make her sweet bread and pastries (called shells and kisses) and white bread rolls. She started her business 35 years ago and with the savings from the business bought the ingredients. She used to work with her aunt and watched her make the bread and learned how to do the same. The business is important because with it they never lack for food. She makes bread every 8 days. On Thursdays and Sundays her daughters help her make the bread. She goes to town to sell her products as she has customers that date back years and know the days she sells on. She sells her products that gives her the money to buy food for her grandchildren. She uses the profit to pay off debts, reinvest and for food. Her dreams and hopes are to live well, quiet and happy with her family and also wishes the best for her children. The members of the group want to thank Kiva and the Fundacion Realidad: \"Thank you for the loans; we are grateful to you.

Leticia's mother taught her how to embroider, and how to combine cheerful colors to make her napkins look attractive.\r\n\r\nOne of Leticia's dreams is to have a dressmaking school where she can teach people to embroider clothes, which is another of her passions that enriches her life.\r\n \r\nLeticia has asked for this loan to buy more material for producing bags and napkins, such as colored threads, bleached and colored cotton, needles and rings to tighten the fabric, and embroidery hooks.\r\n\r\nShe thanks the foundation for the support they have offered to help change her life, provide a better future and enable her family to live better.

She is raising two children with her husband. Tokotsun has been working as a seamstress for a long time and this trade is still helping her earn some income from periodically sewing traditional Kyrgyz wedding dresses. But now the main occupation of Tokotsun is raising livestock and produce sales. This business was started in 1992 with a starting capital of 5,000 som (KGS) and now it yields profits of 5,000 som (KGS) monthly, mainly from dairy sales.

Jocelyn's goal in life is to give a progressive way of living to her family. Jocelyn is 34 years old and married with four school-age children.\r\n\r\nJocelyn runs a rice farming business, planting rice on their farm within their village. Jocelyn has been in this business for 10 years. She has 1.5 hectares of rice fields, from which she usually earns a net income of P40,000 per crop.\r\n\r\nJocelyn\u2019s income from her last crop was invested in another business for an additional source of income for the family.
