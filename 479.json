D. C. G. and her family started Express Cleaners in 2002 after her husband\u2019s employer, a commercial laundry service, went out of business. Maria was a busy stay-at-home mom with four kids when her husband, Aron, came home and told her he had lost his job. However, they viewed this unfortunate event as an opportunity to start their own dry cleaning business. They spent their savings and bought machinery to start the business. Aron\u2019s coworkers at the commercial laundry service company came to help set up the machines and teach the whole family how to clean the clothes. Maria and Aron have since opened two more Express Cleaners in the El Paso area and have employed all of their four children. Aron always says, \u201cFrom here to the door, we are all employees, after the exit door, we are family.\u201d \r\n\r\nMaria plans to use this loan to buy a new washer. She and Aron have been using a 30-year-old washer which requires doing everything manually, from measuring out the starch to putting the clothes in a separate spinner and spinning it by hand. The new, larger-capacity washer will calculate the amount of starch automatically, wash the clothes faster, and spin the clothes so they can dry. \r\n\r\nMaria and her children were all born in Mexico and Aron was born in Los Angeles. Once Maria set foot in the United States, she knew that she had made her first step toward success. After staying at home with her kids for the majority of their youth, she was sad that she had made it to the U.S. (a place she defines as a \u201cland where dreams come true\u201d), and had not completed her dream of starting her own business. Now, as the co-owner of three Express Cleaners that employ her family and people in the community, she has become that much closer to her dream. However, Maria affirms that she has several more steps till she achieves her goals, and these steps have to be taken slowly and firmly. She wants to own, not rent, the working space, to buy better machinery to grow her business, and to pass it down to her grandchildren. Maria says, \u201cThe United States is a place where dreams come true, but you have to work very hard and start from scratch. It is not easy.\u201d\r\n\r\nMaria and Aron employ all of their children. Their son Mario, the accountant, says, \u201cNothing can compare to owning your own business. It takes time, sacrifice and responsibility, but in the end it is worth it because you\u2019re seeing something that is working. I know that I can pass this on to my kids; my whole family is putting something into this business. It is very beautiful\u201d.

L. is a married woman who lives in Sitio Cagay, Brgy. Buenavista, Escalante City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by selling fish. Her husband, Danilo, age 44, works as a fisherman and also helps with his wife's business. They have seven children who are 4 to 21 years old. \r\n\r\nLeonora joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1999 because she wanted something better for her family. With the help of her past 14 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, and by the sweat of her brow, Leonora has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty. Her previous loan of 19,500 Philippine pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, improving her family's standard of living. This time, for her 15th loan, she is borrowing PHP 19,500, which she intends to use as additional capital for her fishing vending business and for fishing materials so that she can continue to save up for future home repairs.

F. is a married woman who lives in Brgy.

They have two children who are 34 and 38 years old: One is married and the other one is working to help pay for the family's living expenses. \r\n\r\nVirginia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past five loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Virginia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 10,000 Philippines pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her sixth loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000, which she intends to use to pay for more stock to sell in her general store so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her granddaughter and to set up a machine shop for her husband. Virginia F. is a Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means honorable) woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF: <\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon.

She lives in Pasil, Brgy. Malabugas, Bayawan, Negros Oriental. \r\n\r\nShe has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2002 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her pig-fattening business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of 7,000 Philippines pesos (PHP). \r\n\r\nAnnabelle is now borrowing PHP 10,000 so that she can purchase feeds and vitamins for the pigs she is raising. This will be her 13th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 15,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Annabelle aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means honorable) way.\r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF: <\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon. Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

N. is a single woman who lives in Sitio Mambucog, Brgy. Zone 16, Talisay City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures: a general store and being a cosmetics agent.\r\n\r\nElsie joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Elsie has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 10,000 Philippines pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 7,600, uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her fifth loan, she is borrowing PHP 11,000, which she intends to use as additional working capital for her general store and cosmetic-sales business so that she can continue to save up for future home repairs and expansion of her business. \r\n\r\nElsie N. is a Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means honorable) woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF: <\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon.

Luz has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2003 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her general store and sugarcane farm, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of 6,000 Philippine pesos (PHP). Ma.

Her previous loan of PHP 17,000 (which she paid off well within its term) was just another step on her journey toward economic freedom. Ma.

G. is a married woman who lives in Brgy. Liloan, Santander, Cebu. She earns her living by selling soft drinks and snacks. Her husband, Simeon G., works as a security guard. \r\n\r\nOlivia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she wanted something better for her family. With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, and through her own efforts, Olivia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty. Her previous loan of 12,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 2,500, improving her family's standard of living. This time, for her fifth loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000, which she intends to use to pay for more soft drinks to sell so that she can continue to save up for the future security of her family. Olivia G. is a <i>Dungganon<\/i> woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means <u>honorable<\/u>).

M. is a married woman who lives in Prk. Golden Rosary, Brgy. Jonobjonob, Escalante City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating three business ventures:   trisikad transport, food vending and livestock. Her husband Ricarido, who is 50 years old, works as a driver to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have four children who are 14 to 24 years old. Luzmarie joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1999 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 16 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Luzmarie has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8000, improving the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 17th loan, she is borrowing PHP 19,000, which she intends to use to do some maintenance work in her food stall at the local school canteen and purchase goods to resell so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Luzmarie M. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nLuzmarie is shown in the accompanying photo posing with the trisikad (bicycle with a sidecar for passengers) that is one of her sources of income in addition to her food vending and livestock raising activities.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF),is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

R. is a married woman who lives in Purok Mahogany, Brgy. Jonobjonob, Escalante City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by growing vegetables.  Her husband, Reniboy, who is 44 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have nine children who are 6 to 22 years old. Luzminda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Luzminda has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 12,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4,000, improving the family's standard of living.  This time, for her fifth loan, she is borrowing PHP 13,000, which she intends to use to purchase fertilizers for her eggplant garden so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Luzminda R. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nLuzminda is shown in the accompanying photo with large sacks of her vegetables all packed up and ready to be taken to the market.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Kalubihan, Brgy. Libertad, Escalante City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  a general store and food vending. Her husband Edgardo, who is 44 years old, works as a driver to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have six children who are 2 months to 20 years old. Jocelyn joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 10 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Jocelyn has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 11th loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000, which she intends to use to buy stock for her general store and food vending businesses so that she can continue to pay for her daughter's school tuition. Jocelyn V. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\n\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

She earns her living by operating two business ventures: dry goods sales and a cafeteria. Her husband Pedro D., who is 51 years old, works as a dry goods vendor to earn his living and also helps with his wife's business activities. They have five children who are 17 to 30 years old. Julianita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1999 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 19 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Julianita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 15,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 5,500 PHP,  uplifting her family's standard of living. This time, for her 20th cycle loan, she is borrowing 15,000 PHP, which she intends to use as additional capital in her business activities so that she can continue to save up for the future security of her family and the education of her children. Julianita D. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Adjacent are the communities of San Francisco Cheje and Ejido de Malacota.

She finished secondary school and she comments that she wants to use her business to help her husband so that their children can become professionals as well as learn to run a business so that some day they can have their own.\r\n\r\nShe is married and has two children, a boy and a girl.  She raises sheep that she sells in the Ixtlahuaca market on Mondays and also to neighbors and relatives primarily.\r\n\r\nShe started four years ago not thinking it would become a source of income.  She enjoys the business because profits she earns from it provide a few comforts for her children but especially guarantees that they have enough to eat.\r\n\r\nHer dedication and perseverance will make good sales possible because she has faced difficulties, like animal disease and death, in the past.  However, with help from the loan she will rise above these problems and keep her business safe.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3225,"image":{"id":621590,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To restart her cattle raising business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Atlacomulco, Estado de M\u00e9xico","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":158,"posted_date":"2010-10-21T19:20:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adriana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Griselda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria De Lourdes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Cristina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Magdalena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ma Cristina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esperanza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Antonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irais","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":40000,"loan_amount":3225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2053},{"due_date":"2010-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2106},{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2160},{"due_date":"2010-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2215},{"due_date":"2010-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":2272},{"due_date":"2010-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":2331},{"due_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":2390},{"due_date":"2010-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":2452},{"due_date":"2010-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":2515},{"due_date":"2010-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":2579},{"due_date":"2010-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":2645},{"due_date":"2011-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2713},{"due_date":"2011-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2783},{"due_date":"2011-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2854},{"due_date":"2011-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":2928},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3004}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":165.52},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":169.8},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":174.15},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":178.58},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":183.18},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":187.94},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":192.69},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":197.7},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":202.77},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":207.93},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":213.25},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":218.74},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":224.38},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":230.1},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":236.07},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":242.2}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":335.32,"local_amount":4159,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:29:29Z","rounded_local_amount":4177.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177387602,"comment":null},{"amount":916.54,"local_amount":11368,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:40:40Z","rounded_local_amount":11417.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182525498,"comment":null},{"amount":821.65,"local_amount":10191,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:48:36Z","rounded_local_amount":10235.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188660041,"comment":null},{"amount":1151.49,"local_amount":14282,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:39:51Z","rounded_local_amount":14344.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191403310,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-10-22T15:29:13Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T02:39:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":240132,"name":"Lorena","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lorena K. is a married woman who lives in Tinago, Bayawan City, Negros Oriental. She earns her living by operating a fish vending business. Her husband, Nicaster K., who is 47 years old, works as a fisherman and also helps with his wife's business activities. They have two children who are 21 and 24 years old. Lorena joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2006 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past five loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Lorena has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 15,000 PHP helped in uplifting her family's standard of living. This time, for her sixth cycle loan, she is borrowing 29,000 PHP, which she intends to use to pay for more additional capital so that she can continue to save up for the future security of her family and pay off all of her outstanding debts, while still sustaining her family's needs. Lorena is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

The four of them live in the central jungle (native Pumpuriani community). As head of her native community, Frida is in charge of contracting on the farm lands, since the main activity for the residents is planting plantains and coffee. For 12 years, now, she has been planting hybrid corn, plantains, and coffee. To maintain the quality of her products, she constantly cares for them because if she doesn't cut back the weeds her plantations won't be able to grow strong and nourished. \"You have to work every day,\" she says. Her work has made it so her plants are quality, so sellers visit her farmlands to buy her harvests. Frida doesn't just do farming, though. She set up a small store where she sells basic-needs items as well as cold drinks. The strong heat and remoteness of the place make it so she has good revenue. This is her fifth loan through Kiva partner MFP, and as president of her communal bank, she is thankful for the support that the bank members receive. Frida is planning to invest her loan in the maintenance of her plantations. She opened two hectares of farmland, and she is sure she will be able to plant more."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":621599,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Care for her coffee plantations","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-10-26T20:50:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Frida ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":725,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:41:26Z","rounded_local_amount":2020.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211269390,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-10-27T00:56:22Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T11:41:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":240137,"name":"Seymur","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Seymur N. is from the district of Agsu.

She lives in Sa-ac 1, Buaya, Cordova, Cebu. \r\n\r\nShe has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2008 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She earns an average monthly income of 19,600 Philippines pesos (PHP). \r\n\r\nSusana is now borrowing PHP 13,000 so that she can purchase another passenger <i>trisikad<\/i> to rent out. This will be her fifth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 8,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. \r\n\r\nSusana aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means honorable) way.\r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF: <\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon.

C. is a married woman who lives in Sa-ac 1, Buaya, Cordova, Cebu. She earns a living by operating a sari-sari (general) store. Her husband, Jose D. C., who is 47 years old, works as a Trisikad driver. They have 5 children who are aged 5 to 22: 1 already has a family, 1 works to help support the family and 2 children are currently going to school. \r\n\r\nCristina joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 4 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Cristina has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 8,500 helped to lift the family's standard of living. This time, for her 5th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 14,000. She intends to use this to purchase more stock for her general store so that she can continue to save up for future house repairs. Cristina D. C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Rizal, Sagay City, Negros Occidental. She operates 2 business ventures:  a fruit stand and a tricycle transport businesses. Her husband, Teddy, who is 44 years old, works as a driver and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have four children who are 16 to  22 years old. \r\n\r\nErlinda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2003 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 12 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Erlinda has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 20,000 helped to lift her family's standard of living. This time, for her 13th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 21,000. She intends to use this to buy more fruit to sell in her fruit stand so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Erlinda A. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Rafaela Barrera, Sagay City, Negros Occidental. She operates a general store. Her husband, Jose, who is 64 years old, works as a laborer and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have four children who are 32 to 40 years old. \r\n\r\nEsperanza joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1993 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 8 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Esperanza has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 1,500, lifting her family's standard of living. This time, for her 9th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000. She intends to use this as additional capital for her sari-sari (general) store so that she can continue to save up for future improvements in her business. Esperanza M. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She lives in Crossing Baterna, Brgy. Rafaela Barrera, Sagay City, Negros occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 1993 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 15,000. \r\n\r\nMaria is now borrowing PHP 19,500 to continue funding operations of her cosmetics business. This will be her 18th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 19,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Maria aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She lives in Brgy. Paraiso, Sagay City, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2003 and has improved her living conditions with the help of loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 10,000. Susan is now borrowing PHP 20,000 so that she can continue to fund her business operations. This will be her 18th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 17,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Susan aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the  Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

C. is a married woman who lives in Hda. Socorro, Brgy. Mabini, Escalante City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating three business ventures: the buying and selling of dry goods, vegetable vending and food vending. Her husband, Edgardo, who is 62 years old, is a retired employee who helps in his wife's business activities. They have five children who are 25 to 37 years old. \r\n\r\nMildred joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 4 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Mildred has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 5,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 3,500, thus lifting her family's standard of living. This time, for her 5th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000 which she intends to use to buy dry goods to sell so that she can continue to save for the future expansion of her business. Mildred D. C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Pablo is currently studying architecture and during the week he studies.  On Fridays and Saturdays, or when he is presented a sound system contract, he is a sound system DJ and mass media announcer for a radio station called Atl\u00e1ntida.  According to his contract to provide sound system services, he receives a monthly income for social events, which is separate from his income as an announcer where he also receives a monthly income.  This income allows Pablo to cover his expenses to study at the university.\r\n<p>\r\nWith the loan he is requesting, Pablo will invest it in the purchase of portable equipment that manages the sound system consoles, since he burned out the player that he had to play the CDs.

M. graduated from the Art Institute of Dallas with a fashion design degree and was promptly employed by a company that designs cheerleading uniforms, Varsity Brands. On the side, Jacqueline was designing her own clothes, and when she tried to sell her products through a variety of outlets, she realized how difficult it is for independent designers to enter the fashion industry. So, in 2008, the 23-year-old entrepreneur spent her savings on paying programmers to build a website where she could sell her designs. However, her vision was much larger than selling her own products; she wanted to help all beginner and independent designers make their products accessible and available to a wider market. Artists can post their designs on the website and if they sell anything, Jacqueline takes a 10% commission on the sale. The website launched in July of 2009 and she currently has 15 designers and over 100 products on the website!\r\n\r\nJacqueline has gained many new skills in the process of starting an online business, but one area that continues to be her biggest challenge is advertising. While her website design is attractive and workable, not enough people know about it yet. With this loan, Jacqueline will be able to hire an internet marketing specialist who will assist her in establishing the best practices in online advertising of her design business website.  \r\n\r\nEven though Jacqueline is a full-time employee and works on this website during her spare time, she still finds time to give back. She volunteers for the Texas\u2019 Next Top Designer event by making fliers and finding sponsors. Jaqueline says, \u201cMy life is a little more stressful because I have no idea where this business will go in the future, but it's exciting and it's something I love to do for fun! It doesn\u2019t even feel like work.\u201d\r\n\r\nFeel free to check out her website at www.designsociety.net.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1600,"image":{"id":621869,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"To hire an internet marketing specialist","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"US","country":"United States","town":"Dallas, Texas","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39.76 -98.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":173,"posted_date":"2010-10-20T07:12:21Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jacqueline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1600,"loan_amount":1600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":147.09},{"due_date":"2010-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":155.74},{"due_date":"2011-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":156.77},{"due_date":"2011-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":158.25},{"due_date":"2011-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":160.64},{"due_date":"2011-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":161.26},{"due_date":"2011-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":162.99},{"due_date":"2011-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":164.32},{"due_date":"2011-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":165.98},{"due_date":"2011-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":166.96}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":147.09},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":155.74},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":156.77},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.25},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":160.64},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":161.26},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.99},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":164.32},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165.98},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.96}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":147.09,"local_amount":147.09,"processed_date":"2010-11-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T11:32:08Z","rounded_local_amount":147.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182463517,"comment":null},{"amount":155.74,"local_amount":155.74,"processed_date":"2010-12-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T11:13:40Z","rounded_local_amount":155.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188600973,"comment":null},{"amount":156.77,"local_amount":156.77,"processed_date":"2011-01-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T00:36:23Z","rounded_local_amount":156.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191346840,"comment":null},{"amount":158.25,"local_amount":158.25,"processed_date":"2011-02-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:01:12Z","rounded_local_amount":158.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195764613,"comment":null},{"amount":160.64,"local_amount":160.64,"processed_date":"2011-03-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T09:53:57Z","rounded_local_amount":160.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201207747,"comment":null},{"amount":821.51,"local_amount":821.51,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T09:56:44Z","rounded_local_amount":821.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206076651,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-10-20T22:34:24Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T09:56:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":240234,"name":"Cinthya Isabel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"EL Banco Comunal An\u00edbal San Andr\u00e9s que se re\u00fane cada quince d\u00edas en el Cant\u00f3n Montecristi.

M. started a non-emergency medical transportation business, Dedicated Medical Transport, a year and a half ago. With rates comparable to a traditional taxi, Jason specializes in wheelchair, senior and special needs transportation for those customers who might need more care and comfort than a cab. Typical destinations for his customers include doctor\u2019s appointments, clinics, dialysis centers, rehabilitation, etc.\r\n\r\nJason began his business as the sole employee with one van and a customer that needed transport to a dialysis center three times a week.  Since then, he has expanded his business to four vans and five employees. \r\n\r\nDedicated Medical Transport works directly with individuals but, also, is contracted by vendors. It takes 30-35 days to get paid by the vendors, and Jason has a cash-flow financial crunch. He plans on using his loan for operating expenses to pay his employees to solve this cash-flow problem. He has had a difficult time securing a loan because other lenders only want to lend for capital purposes, such as autoloans, rather than loans for operating expenses.\r\n\r\nWith twins on the way, Jason is excited to eventually expand his business to other parts of Central Texas such as San Antonio and Houston. From the start, Jason knew that he wanted to start a business that was rewarding and recession-proof. His comfortable, affordable transportation services are definitely in demand and Jason is hopeful to fulfill this need. He says, \u201cAt the end of the day, I know I\u2019ve helped people.\u201d

His grandfather owned a welding shop and did repairs for people on the side. His father was also a well-known handyman in the Lubbock area. After the father\u2019s recent death, James and his wife used their savings and turned the family trade into an actual business, complete with a name and a logo, Lonestar Repair and Remodeling. Before James made this decision, he had worked for a variety of construction companies and was promoted quickly despite his young age. James says, \u201cI\u2019ve been in construction since I could swing a hammer\u201d. However, following in his father\u2019s footsteps, James was not happy working for other people and knew that his dream was to be self-employed. It was not too difficult to secure the first clients as they have been loyal customers to his family for years. James says, \u201cI live in Lubbock, known as the biggest small town.

With his wife at Wayland Baptist University studying to be a teacher, the couple are on a tight budget. Lucky for James, his wife is an \u201cextreme budgeter\u201d and can make a dollar stretch. James\u2019 marketing plan is to be an honest businessman with a good work ethic. He believes that through word of mouth, people will choose him because of his affordable and fair

Bernard, his wife, Charlene, and his six boys were separated during the extreme chaos the city experienced during the storm\u2019s immediate aftermath. Charlene and the boys evacuated on a truck reserved for women and children with Texas as its general destination while Bernard made his way to the closest airport. Among the many long lines of people going to different cities, Bernard chose to go to San Antonio because he had heard its mayor, Phil Hardberger, announce on CNN that the city had sufficient resources to take care of Hurricane Katrina evacuees. Because the cell phone towers had shut down, Bernard and Charlene had a difficult time getting in touch with each other. After two weeks, Bernard learned from his mother that Charlene and the boys were in the Astrodome in Houston. Bernard went to Houston, found his family, and took them back to San Antonio. The Bayou Baglery had been forced to close and Bernard did not have a job or home to return to in New Orleans. The McGraws decided to set down their roots in San Antonio and Bernard found a run-down shack on the Southside of town and set up a kitchen with a hot plate, a refrigerator, and a deep fryer from the flea market, and tables and chairs from Wal-mart. Soon after, Bernard realized that his make-shift restaurant needed to make several changes in order to meet permit standards. Also, in that short amount of time, Bernard developed an incredibly loyal and gracious clientele from the close-by military base. They raised money at the base to help Bernard make all the required repairs and to obtain various permits and licenses. Since 2007, Bernard\u2019s Creole Kitchen has won the San Antonio Critic\u2019s Choice Award, the Blue Plate Award and the Talk of the Town Award. \r\n\r\nBernard studies Biblical Theology at the Baptist University of the Americas and has been asked by them to open his kitchen in their dining area. There will be a lunch line for a guaranteed amount of 85 students a day (plus additional students without meal plans who will pay cash) and a restaurant with a seating area for his regular customers. With this loan, Bernard plans to stock the restaurant with enough supplies to handle the increased amount of customers. Supplies will include food, new menus, salt and pepper shakers, a new register system, and a safe. \r\n\r\nIn addition to going to school and managing his restaurant, Bernard still makes time to give back. Five years ago, he started a program called \u201cGumbo Under the Bridge\u201d feeding homeless people. He says, \u201cAfter being homeless, you never judge a homeless person again.\u201d Last year, he also started a job-start program that he participated in at his own high school where students work at large companies and learn how to fill out job applications and to dress and act in a professional manner.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4275,"image":{"id":621896,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"New

the city that always has a reason to celebrate, people love to have fiestas! Esteban C. and his extensive family are not an exception, and what is a party without a moonwalk? The kids in Esteban\u2019s family always wished for moonwalks at their parties but they were too expensive, not to mention the required large deposit. Therefore, he decided to buy a couple of moonwalks and rent them out at affordable prices to his family and acquaintances. Eventually, Esteban realized there was quite a demand for moonwalks and other party supplies like chairs and tables. What started as a kind gesture to make moonwalks more available to kids in his neighborhood and family has turned into a thriving business!\r\n\r\n\r\n His present inventory of chairs is inadequate to meet the growing demand for his party supply business. Therefore, Esteban plans to use his loan to purchase more chairs. Esteban plans to continue growing his business, and eventually to pass it on to his grandson.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2344.69,"image":{"id":604753,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Party

She has been engaged in her business for over a year and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month. She and her husband have four school-aged children and live in the village of Pagbangkeruan, Alcala, Cagayan.\r\n    \r\nEarlier this year, Marilou joined ASKI to gain access to financial services. Her goal was to help improve her living situation and increase her ability to engage in business activities. Marilou is requesting her first loan in the amount of 4000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 34 branches covering the central and northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk, and small business entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

He is a dairy farmer from Kisii town in western Kenya. He has been practicing mixed farming for six years and employs one farmhand. His mixed farm produces milk which he sells to the local market. He is also a lecturer in animal husbandry and treats animals in his area. His biggest challenges in farming have been the lack of enough animal feed, stiff market competition, loan facilities being rare and the purchasing power of clients being very low.\r\n<p>\r\nLumumba has requested this loan of 45,000 KES through Juhudi Kilimo to purchase and insure a dairy cow.

She is 47 years old. Lucia is the group leader of a nine-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nLucia is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Lucia owns and operates a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling daily-use products such as shampoo, soap and toothpaste in the local community. Lucia has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Lucia joined ASKI to gain access to financial services, to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Lucia is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Lucia from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 34 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

A. is from the village of Cabisera 17.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from providing motorcycle transport in the local community. Alma has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 2500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Alma joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Alma has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to repair existing vehicle for better service. Alma is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional vehicle for the business. This loan will be the 4th loan taken out by Alma from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

is 54 years old. He is married with four children, only one of whom attends school. He is a dairy farmer from Kitale town in western Kenya. He has been farming for over six years and employs two farmhands. His farm produces milk, which he sells to the local market. He also earns income from the sale of maize and bananas to the local market. His biggest challenge has been diseases, which are costly to treat.\r\n<br>Christopher has requested this loan of 41,600 KES from Kiva partner, Juhudi Kilimo, to purchase and insure a dairy cow. The proceeds from this loan will help him in paying school fees for his child at university. He will also be able to provide enough food for his family.

Theresa Erma T. is a married woman who lives in Sitio Sutay, Brgy. Antipolo, Pontevedra, Negros Occidental. She earns a living by operating three business ventures: food vending, a general store and a tricycle transport business. Her husband, Fausto, who is 49 years old, works as a tricycle driver to earn his living and he also helps in his wife's businesses. They have five children aged between 7 and 27. \r\nMa. Theresa Erma joined Kiva partner, NWTF-Project Dungganon, in 2003 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 13 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Ma. Theresa Erma has been gradually lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 17,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 6,100 PHP, thus raising her family's standard of living. This time, for her 14th loan, she is borrowing 19,000 PHP, which she intends to use to process the documents for her daughter to work abroad so that she could continue to save up for the future education of her children. \r\nMa.Theresa Erma T. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n About NWTF\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means 'honorable'). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them 'Dungganon' \u2013 a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of the community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Traditionally, Arab women would bake dough in a communal oven in the morning, to provide their family with their daily bread needs. They would prepare smaller portions of dough with different toppings for breakfast at this time. \r\n\r\nAli has been a pastry baker since 2004. He makes delicious pastries that no one can resist.

One of his children is currently attending school.\r\n\r\nHe has requested this loan of 38,000 KES through Juhudi Kilimo for rabbit keeping. He hopes that this project will increase the income for his family and assist in paying school fees for his son. His biggest challenge has been drought and lack of a reliable market for rabbit meat. He hopes that in future he will be able to expand his agri-business to even practice poultry farming.\r\n\r\nHe comments that the future is bright with financial support from Juhudi Kilimo."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":428.36,"image":{"id":622183,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"For

C. is from the village of Brgy.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from buying and selling fruit and vegetables in the local community. Violeta has been engaged in her business for over 7 years and earns approximately 3000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Violeta joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Violeta has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Violeta is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand product offering. This will be the 8th loan taken out by Violeta from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

P. is from the village of Matusalem.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Baltazar has been engaged in his business for over 18 years and earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Baltazar joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Baltazar has successfully repaid a previous loan of 25,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to repair a transport vehicle used in the business. Baltazar is requesting a new loan of 26,000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand product offering. This will be the 9th loan taken out by Baltazar from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of his children. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 34 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

P. is from the village of Brgy. Bonfal Proper, Bayombong, Nueva Vizcaya. She is 51 years old. Erlinda is married and has 2 adult children. To make a living, Erlinda owns & operates a motorcycle business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from operating tricycle (three-wheeled) transport services. Erlinda has been engaged in her business for over 6 years and earns approximately 7,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Erlinda joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Erlinda has successfully repaid a previous loan of 11,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase tires and other accessories. Erlinda is requesting a new loan of 13,000 PHP which will be used to repair existing vehicle for better service. This will be the 4th loan taken out by Erlinda from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 34 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She has been farming for five years and employs one farmhand. Her mixed farm produces maize, beans and milk, all of which she sells to the local market. She also earns income from the sale of clothes to the local market. Her primary challenges in farming are the lack of enough funds to buy farm inputs such as fertilizers, the lack of a ready market for her products and diseases which affect her farm products and animals.\r\n\r\nShe has requested this loan of 30,000KES from Juhudi Kilimo to purchase and insure a dairy cow. The extra income from this loan will help her to pay the school fees of her children and improve the livelihood of her family.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Rahmonberdi hopes that you trust in his hard work and honesty.  \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":622281,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchasing of cattle in order to expand the business  ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Kanibadam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.283333 70.416667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":100,"posted_date":"2010-10-21T19:40:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rahmonberdi","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-10-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":6500,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":437.01},{"due_date":"2010-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":472.76},{"due_date":"2011-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":475.57},{"due_date":"2011-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":491.95},{"due_date":"2011-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":524.3},{"due_date":"2011-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":526.95},{"due_date":"2011-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":541.13},{"due_date":"2011-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":570.48},{"due_date":"2011-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":586.12},{"due_date":"2011-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":601.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":625.71},{"due_date":"2011-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":646.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.85},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.1},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.74},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.53},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.99},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.61},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.87},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.65},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.26},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":138.81},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":144.39},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":149.2}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":100.85,"local_amount":437.01,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-24T10:15:43Z","rounded_local_amount":441.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182857244,"comment":null},{"amount":109.1,"local_amount":472.76,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-20T09:41:58Z","rounded_local_amount":478.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189271883,"comment":null},{"amount":109.74,"local_amount":475.57,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:11:37Z","rounded_local_amount":480.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191448153,"comment":null},{"amount":113.53,"local_amount":491.95,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-17T08:23:29Z","rounded_local_amount":497.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196136796,"comment":null},{"amount":120.99,"local_amount":524.3,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-16T08:20:54Z","rounded_local_amount":530.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201310960,"comment":null},{"amount":945.79,"local_amount":4098.41,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-19T07:51:52Z","rounded_local_amount":4144.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206666338,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-10-24T17:36:02Z","paid_date":"2011-05-19T07:51:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":240494,"name":"Nemat","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"H.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<p>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<p>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She lives in her own home and also supports her nephew that lives with her.\r\n\r\nShe left the city of Maputo for the district of Namaacha with her family in search of better living conditions.  She has worked as a simple farmer for more than 30 years, producing crops and grains to sell.  She has one employee who helps her in her production.  She makes an income of between 3,000 and 4,000 meticais per month, which she puts towards her living expenses.  She also saves a little in her home.  \r\n\r\nShe had already had loans with Procredit and decided not to continue with them.  She became familiar with Hluvuku through mobilizations they did in the area where she works.  This is her first loan in the amount of 20,000 meticais, and she will use it to buy agricultural supplies to increase her production.\r\n\r\nShe is confident that she will make her payments before the given deadlines so she can ask for another loan to increase her production even more and to acquire a pump to use for irrigation."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":622297,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

is 29 years old and married with 3 children who are between the ages of 4 and 6. Two of the children are currently attending school. He is a farmer from Nyamira town in western Kenya where he has been farming for 5 years. His mixed farm produces tea, maize, tomatoes and vegetables which he sells to the local market. He depends on the income from his farming activities to cater for the basic needs of his family.\r\n\r\nHe has requested this loan of 30,000KES through Juhudi Kilimo to purchase and maintain a dairy cow.

She is 46 years old, married and mother to seven children, whose ages range from 14 to 28 years old. Mrs. T. began her commercial activity more than six years ago. She chose it because she liked it, but also because she was anxious to procure an income which would allow her to improve her family's living conditions. Her business is very diversified, since while she sells fabric, sheets and \"thioups\" (dyed pieces of fabric), she also sells sweets and breakfasts.

N. is a banana vendor who sells her wares at retail prices at the market. She works every day of the week. She also generates additional income through her small grocery shop. The main business challenges for Nulu include seasonality and defaulters. \r\n\r\nNulu has requested a loan of 400,000\/= Ugandan Shillings from MCDT SACCO, which she will use to buy more bunches of bananas to offer for sale.
