She was the one who introduced her to having her own business.  The woman supported her children through this business.  That is where, armed with courage, she started to sell primarily clothes by order on credit.  Little by little she was getting a large inventory.  She says that in spite of the economic crisis that the country has suffered, it has not affected her so much.  A while back she started selling for cash only, no credit.  Because she has plenty of customers, she has been able to maintain her volume of sales.\r\n\r\nThe loan is to buy a larger quantity of merchandise to stock her business more now that the Christmas season is getting closer.  Her goal has always been to build a larger and more appropriate place for her business.  She currently uses the living room of her house.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":438854,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-12-01T21:20:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ayda Lina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":12000,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":150.06,"local_amount":3001.15,"processed_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:32:48Z","rounded_local_amount":3114.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110681493,"comment":null},{"amount":149.94,"local_amount":2998.85,"processed_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:34:36Z","rounded_local_amount":3111.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118076024,"comment":null},{"amount":150,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:08:51Z","rounded_local_amount":3113.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123912030,"comment":null},{"amount":150,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-06T07:50:52Z","rounded_local_amount":3113.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128947884,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-12-09T14:48:27Z","paid_date":"2010-05-06T07:50:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":158374,"name":"Silvia Dinora","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Silvia tiene 42 a\u00f1os, es casada y posee cuatro hijos ya mayores de edad.

Below are details of their different activities they do to earn a living:\r\n<p>\r\nJuan Antionio Colindre is the leader of the group. He is 64 years old, married and has three children from his marriage. He grinds corn and has a corn grinder in this house. He starts work hours before daybreak despite the fact that he also works as a mason laying bricks while his wife continues with the grinder. Their marriage is very stable and thanks to the income from the grinder, their family has moved ahead. They are now requesting a loan to improve the stand the grinder sits on. \r\n<p>\r\nElias Antonio C. is a store keeper who uses a grinder to mill corn. His business is located at his home and has been working in this type of business for 8 years. Thanks to his income he has been able to cover his families costs and other obligations. It should be noted that Senor C. suffered an accident on a machine while he was working for box manufacturing factory packing Puros. He cut four fingers on his right hand and it was there he felt it was time to look for another source of income as he couldn\u2019t continue working there. Until now, he has supported his wife and 4 children, some of whom, with lots of sacrifice, have managed to graduate and  others who are still studying. He needs to replace his corn grinder. \r\n<p>\r\nEsteban S.\u2019s income generating activity is selling different flavor ice creams. He sells his cones in different neighborhoods and districts around Danli. He sells ice cream using his bike.

He works as a veterinary technologist in the area where he lives. At the same time he works in a dairy.\r\nHe is used to working in the countryside because, since he was a child, he has helped his mother. His father abandoned his family when he was little. He lives with his mother and he has always lived with her.  Christian has a three-year-old child. He is not married and his child lives with him and his mother. His mother takes care of the child because the child\u2019s mother works as a teacher in the city and cannot care for the child.\r\nWith the loan he is asking for, he will buy a cow and build a barn to house cattle. The rainy season is arriving. He would like his animals to be comfortable because when they are comfortable they produce more milk. He is a very responsible businessman and he enjoys his work.\r\nIn the future, Christian would like to finish his veterinary studies and create a better life for his son and his mother.\r\n<br

Francisca lives with her husband and three children, ages three to seven, and currently is due to give birth next month!

Francisca will use this loan, her fourth with Esperanza International, to purchase new jeans, blouses, and t-shirts to sell.\r\n\r\nIn addition to running her small business, Francisca also helps her sister with a hair salon. This gives her two jobs, and she is obviously also a full-time mother with one on the way. Francisca loves Esperanza, and is very grateful for the loan officers that she has worked with. She dreams to help her children with the profits from the loans, sending them all to get great educations. Francisca is also planning on adding on to her house, because currently she feels it is too small for her growing family. With your loan, Francisca will be one step closer to that dream.

She spends her days knocking on doors, offering various products such as perfumes, clothing, sandals, cosmetics and other household items to potential customers. She is a hardworking individual which is exhibited through her initiative to complete high school by attending night classes.\r\n\r\nGricelda is applying for a loan of 200,000 colons. With this loan she plans to purchase more products for sale and hopes to secure a better price from her suppliers through larger purchases. This will be her second loan with Fundacion Mujer; her first loan was paid back, on time and in full, in a short six months. This loan will enable her business to grow and take her closer to her dream of one day being able to open a store from where she could sell products, allowing her to travel less.\r\n\r\nGricelda\u2019s main challenges are logistical. In order to purchase raw materials, she must travel to a town called Chasse. The town is not very far away, in absolute terms, but it is separated from Suretka by a large river. The river water travels at high speed which makes crossing dangerous, especially during the rainy season. Gricelda says that her main challenge is getting from her village, Suretka, to the location of her supplier, in Chasse. Buses are infrequent; Gricelda often ends up making the trip on foot which is a laborious task to say the least.\r\n\r\nIndigenous rural areas such as Suretka are characterized by many difficulties such as a lack of job opportunities, infrastructural deficiencies, low levels of formal education and lack of available financial services. Additionally, despite her entrepreneurial spirit, Gricelda\u00b4s efforts have been hamstrung due to her exclusion from the traditional banking system. This is where you, through Kiva\u2019s lending model, can help. Your loan is a direct investment in the improvement of living conditions of a woman living in a poor Indigenous community of Caribbean Costa Rica. By lending to Gricelda, a proactive and hard working entrepreneur, you are enabling her to take the first steps on a path that leads to the end of poverty.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":438925,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"To

year-old Jocelyn J. lives in the village of Brgy Batang, Himamaylan City, Negros Occidental. Her husband, Larry, is a fisherman and they are blessed with 4 children who are between 18 and 24 years old. Her dream is for her children to earn their college degrees and get a good job, so that they can enjoy a comfortable life.\r\n\r\nTo help her husband achieve this dream, she sold her husband's daily fish catch either within their community or in the nearby villages. Her hard work and perseverance bore fruit so that she needed new capital just to maintain her sales volume. This inspired her to join NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1991 so that she could continuously access new capital for her business.\r\n\r\nWith new capital, she was able to expand the product lines in her general store; her business activities have been a big help in supporting all of the needs of their family, slowly improving their living conditions. As her business improved, she also engaged in food vending, which she put up in front of her general store. Now she earns about PHP 19,200 per month, which she adds to her revolving working capital and she saves most of her income for the education of her children.\r\n\r\nHer previous loan of PHP 29,500 contributed a lot in developing her business and even her performance in NWTF-PD, maintaining her good credit record. The said amount was fully paid on-time without any delay. As Center Chief, her good credit performance makes her a good example to her members. Now in her 19th cycle, she is borrowing the same amount of PHP 19,500 to be used to obtain additional capital for her general store and for the repair of her pumpboat.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":439034,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To obtain

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Julie, 36, is from the village of Annayatan Baggao, Cagayan. She is the leader of an ASKI loan group consisting of five members. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Annayatan group.\r\n\r\n<p>Julie is married and has three school-aged children. She has been operating a furniture and cabinet-making business for over five years. Her income is mainly derived from the making and selling of cabinets and wardrobe furniture to local businesses and community members. The business generates approximately 8,000 PHP a month.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2009, Julie joined ASKI to access their financial services and improve both her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Julie is requesting her first loan from ASKI, in the amount of 5000 PHP, to purchase additional raw materials to expand her product offerings. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>About ASKI:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>ASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

P. lives in Sitio Tuburan, Hinigaran, Negros Occidental. She is 37 years old and married to Pelagio, who is a farmer. They have three children between the ages of 12 and 19. Two of them are still attending school and one is working in Manila, the capital city of the Philippines, and helps her parents support their family by sending money every month. Jonalyn wants her children to finish their studies, and she wants to help her husband earn income for their family.\r\n \r\nTo help her husband earn a living for the family, she put up a small general store adjacent to their house. At the start, her earnings were small, but it helped support their household expenses, and she saw that it had potential for expansion if she only had the necessary capital to fill her store with products to sell. This is why she joined the Kiva field partner, NWTF-Project Dungganon, in 1988, and with the additional capital from her loans, she is now able to earn a monthly income of about $213 a month, most of which she spends for their household expenses. She is also saving up for the education of her children. \r\n\r\nNow she is in her 18th loan cycle, borrowing 27,000 PHP as additional working capital for her general store.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros  Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of  thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

One of her three children is in high school.  Her husband, Roberto, age 47, works as a plumber.\r\n\r\nRoberta buys and sells frozen processed meats, such as longanisa (a local sausage), embutido (meat loaf), and hotdogs. Her products appeal a lot to her customers, especially working mothers who pack her products in their children's school lunch boxes. She is thankful to the Center for Community Transformation (CCT) Credit Cooperative for providing her loans, which she has used to buy her products in bulk and stores them in the freezer. She now earns more than P5,000.00 a month in net income, but her earnings sometimes vary depending on the supply and demand for frozen products.\r\n\r\nRoberta applied for a new loan of P12,000.00 from CCT so she can re-stock her frozen supplies. She wishes to see all her children finish their studies.\r\n\r\nAbout CCT\r\n\r\nThe Center for Community Transformation (CCT) is an organized Christian response against poverty and social injustice.

The official name of this borrowing group is Andarayan North Group.\r\n\r\nEditha is married and has six school-aged children. To make a living, Editha operates a family member's specialized retail store selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap & toothpaste in the local community. Editha has been engaged in her business for over 15 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, Editha joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Editha has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. Editha is requesting a new loan of 19,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the eighth loan taken out by Editha from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to support financially immediate members of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

She used the loan to buy plant pots and fertilizers.  From her profits, she was able to buy a service vehicle and another tricycle.\r\n\r\nRosalie applied for a new loan of P17,000.00.  She will use the funds to buy more plant seedlings, organic fertilizers and plant pots.  She hopes to put up another nursery in the next town soon.  \r\n\r\n\r\nAbout CCT\r\n\r\nThe Center for Community Transformation (CCT) is an organized Christian response against poverty and social injustice.

He lives in a house in Anticr\u00e9tico.  His greatest desire is to buy his home, so that he can get out of antichresis (possession and enjoyment of mortgaged property by mortgagee in lieu of interest payments) because it is inconvenient for him to not be able to make changes to his house because it is not his property.  He does have some capital to use towards his home, capital which he is currently using to pay off the antichresis, but he needs six thousand American dollars ($6,000).  His wife sells food out of their house to help support their nuclear family.  They have two dependent children.  Don Edmundo started to work when he was very young, and he has been working in this field for 15 years, with his own car for one and half years.  Now, his work in his own car is easier because they don't have to pay daily rent to anyone; he can just work for himself and his family.  His dream of his own house is not far off, because he now earns more money with his own vehicle, which he can use to pay off his mortgage.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Julia Kastner,

L. lives in Hacienda Malisbog 4, Brgy E Lopez, Silay City, Negros Occidental. She is 45 years old. Her husband, Rogelio, works as a tricycle driver within their village and around Silay City. She has two children who are presently attending school. Her dreams in life are to help her husband generate additional income for the family, so that her children can finish their studies. She also wants to improve her family's living conditions.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 1998 Elvira joined the Kiva field partner, NWTF-Project Dungganon, to have capital to invest in a business. She used her loan for a tricycle as the source of their income. She also invested in the buying and selling of scrap, like empty bottles, scrap iron, plastics and many other things that can be useful and acceptable to sell. As she continued her loans with NWTF, her business grew and earned additional income for the family. She would get a minimum income of $77 a month, which she used for her family. \r\n<p>\r\nPreviously, Elvira borrowed 19,500 PHP as additional capital for her scrap business and it was paid back on a weekly basis, and fully paid within her loan term without any delay. Because of her good credit performance, she was able to access a bigger loan. She recently borrowed  25,000 PHP for her 18th cycle loan, to use as additional capital for her scrap business. The income will be used for the education of her children and for her business.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

C. lives in Paraiso 2, Brgy Taloc, Bago City, Negros Occidental. She is 62 years old. Her husband, Leonardo, helps her in managing their business. The couple is blessed with seven children and twelve grandchildren.  Ramona helps send her grandchildren to school. She would like some of her children to finish with their studies so they can help improve the business and work together as a family to make it grow. \r\n<p>\r\nRamona used to work in the rice field with her husband.  Then she got into pig-fattening as additional income for the family, but it wasn't enough.\r\n<p>\r\nBecause she needed capital to invest in a general store, Ramona joined the Kiva field partner, NWTF-Project Dungganon, in 2005. She was very happy because the family income increased because of her new business. Although she manages her general store business as well as the pig-fattening business, she still does part-time work in the rice field.  With her businesses, she has earned a minimum of about $72 a month.  Ramona saves most of her income for education and for household expenses.\r\n<p>\r\nShe borrowed 19,000 PHP in a previous loan to use as additional capital for her general store. That amount was fully paid within her loan term without any interest. Now, Ramona will be borrowing 19,500 PHP for her 10th cycle loan, to be used as additional capital for her general store and for repairs to her pig pens.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through \"Project Dungganon\" (a Hiligaynon word that means \"Honorable\"). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them \"Dungganon\" -  a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

H. is from the village of Quirino, Solano, Nueva Vizcaya. He is 33 years old. Ulysses is married and has 1 school-aged child. To make a living, he owns and operates a business venture in the services sector. While not the only means of generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from providing transportation services to local community members. Ulysses has been engaged in his motorcycle transport business for over two years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Ulysses joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Ulysses is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to repair a transport vehicle used in the business. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Ulysses from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of his family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fishermen and small business entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Her husband Jesus A. is a driver is with an average net income of 3,000 Philippine pesos (about $65 US).  That amount is not sufficient to support their big family with 4 dependents who are in high school and elementary school. \r\n\r\nTo add their family income, they decided to start using a pump boat for the transport of passengers going to Kapatagan, Lanao del Norte and other parts of Lanao. Now the couple is earning an average net income of not less than 5,000 pesos (about $108 US) a month.  \r\n\r\nMrs. A. joined PAGLAUM MPC in July 2008 because she is very much interested in our products and services. She is also interested in PAGLAUM MPC for being one of the most outstanding cooperatives in Northern Mindanao: we were named Most Outstanding Cooperative in the Philippines during the search for the COOP-LGU Partnership Award 2006. \r\n\r\nWith the willingness to pay shown to our cooperative, she was given the opportunity to request a loan of 7,000 pesos to finance the overhaul and reconditioning of the pump boat engine and the repair of the boat.

C. is from the village of Quirino, Solano, Nueva Vizcaya. She is 37 years old. Rosalinda is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Rosalinda runs a general store. The main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Rosalinda has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 4,000 Philippine pesos a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Rosalinda joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Rosalinda is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the first loan taken out by Rosalinda from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful micro-finance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Cherish C., from the village of Roxas, is the 42-year-old leader of a 13-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Rang-ayan.<p>\r\n\r\nCherish, the married mother of five school-aged children, prepares and sells cooked food for daily meals. Engaged in her business for over 10 years, she earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month. In 2008, Cherish joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Having fully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from ASKI that was used to purchase additional products to sell, Cherish is requesting a new loan of 11000 PHP to purchase additional products to sell.  She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her enterprise. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mainly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.<p>\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partners to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

Now, she is earning an average net income of P2,000 a month.  <P>\r\n\r\nUpon hearing the good news of PAGLAUM MPC as the one of the outstanding cooperatives of Northern Mindanao (awarded the Most Outstanding Cooperative in the Philippines during the search for COOP-LGU Partnership award in the year 2006), she unhesitatingly joined the coop. With her good record in the community and with the capacity to repay, she was given the privilege of accessing the amount of P 5,000 as her 1st loan to add to her capital for her existing sari-sari store. The future income from this loan will be used to meet their daily needs and for the educational expenses for her child who is studying. She is hoping that someday she will have a mini-grocery store in their place.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":435633,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

He has been engaged in this kind of job for eight years already.\r\n\r\nPepe Jun joined Paglaum MPC because he wanted to be part of the organization that is considered as one of the most progressive cooperatives in Northern Mindanao and one that reaches out to rural communities. For the 3rd time, he is given the privilege of obtaining P25,000 to finance his hog-raising activity, especially in buying feed. The remaining amount will be used for the purchase of additional accessories for his electronics repair shop.\r\n\r\nPepe Jun\u2019s future income will be used for his basic needs and for loan repayments.

She says thank you to all Kiva lenders for their support.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":439459,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Phone Use Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase more phone recharge cards and pure water to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Ibadan, Oyo State","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":20,"posted_date":"2009-12-03T19:30:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Idowu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-02T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":170000,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":21250},{"due_date":"2010-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":21250},{"due_date":"2010-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":21250},{"due_date":"2010-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":21250},{"due_date":"2010-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":21250},{"due_date":"2010-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":21250},{"due_date":"2010-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":21250},{"due_date":"2010-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":21250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":146.88},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":146.87},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.88},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.87},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.88},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.87},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.88},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":293.75,"local_amount":42500,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:00:08Z","rounded_local_amount":42828.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110721661,"comment":null},{"amount":146.87,"local_amount":21250,"processed_date":"2010-01-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:03:13Z","rounded_local_amount":21414.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118113253,"comment":null},{"amount":146.87,"local_amount":21250,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:41:49Z","rounded_local_amount":21414.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123949142,"comment":null},{"amount":146.87,"local_amount":21250,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:28:02Z","rounded_local_amount":21414.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128981894,"comment":null},{"amount":146.87,"local_amount":21250,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-11T08:41:59Z","rounded_local_amount":21414.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":137361477,"comment":null},{"amount":146.87,"local_amount":21250,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-29T07:47:46Z","rounded_local_amount":21414.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144740766,"comment":null},{"amount":146.9,"local_amount":21250,"processed_date":"2010-07-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-26T08:22:34Z","rounded_local_amount":21414.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159664291,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-12-24T04:13:55Z","paid_date":"2010-08-26T08:22:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":158562,"name":"Vicky","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Vicky G. is from Rizal, Santiago City.

is Carmelita C., 44, who lives and does business in Dasmari\u00f1as, Cavite. She is a multi-tasking entrepreneur, attending to an array of business activities.  She has been in business for fifteen years. Her husband, Ruperto, 49, is a salesman. They have two children who are both in grade school.\r\n\r\nCarmelita owns a general store, which has been around for fifteen years. In addition, she buys and sells fresh pork meat and dressed chicken. Her neighbors order from her. She buys items from the slaughterhouse in large amounts and delivers to her customers. She makes it a point to ensure that the orders be served as promised, although she sometimes finds it difficult to recover unpaid debts from some customers. She also sells RTW (ready-to-wear) clothing.  Her most recent business venture is bicycle rental. From all these activities, she earns more than PHP 32, 000 in monthly profits. She banks most of her income for future use, especially for her children\u2019s education.\r\n\r\nHer membership with the (CCT) Credit Cooperative has brought her a lot of blessings in life and in business. In anticipation of the upcoming holiday season, she has been receiving a lot of new orders for hog meat and chicken. To answer for her commitments, she will need additional capital. She has applied for a new loan with the cooperative in the amount of PHP 31, 000.  This will be her sixth loan cycle with CCT. \r\n\r\nAbout CCT\r\n\r\nThe Center for Community Transformation (CCT) is an organized Christian response against poverty and social injustice. This is carried out through the fusion of social development initiatives and evangelical mission in a uniquely Filipino context. It serves urban and rural poor communities throughout the Philippines, in pursuit of its desire to see changed lives, strong families, and transformed communities centered in the Lordship of Jesus Christ.  CCT is a member of the Five Talents family.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":438490,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

The most difficult was the death of her child.  Through her period of mourning her community came together and were a great support for her.  She hopes to give back by providing a means to purchase many items that are not easily found in her area.  Items such as white meat, as well as manure for farming, will help her community and shorten the distance people will need to travel for basic necessities.  \r\n\r\nSpecifically, Elizabeth is hoping to secure a loan from GHAPE in order to purchase feed for her livestock, pay the rent for her store\u2019s location and buy various items for resale including beans, rice, salt and groundnuts.  Elizabeth considers that her endeavors will continue to thrive because of her expertise.  Her store is one of the few in her area so she has several loyal customers that buy in bulk.  Similarly, her understanding of the composition of chicken feed and the large space on her compound where they can roam should lead to continued gains in the raising and sale of livestock.    \r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.

Josephine lives alone with her children and is the sole family breadwinner. She did not go to school. About 5 years ago, Josephine began selling sauce condiments (chili pepper, local mustard, fresh tomato, onion, ginger, etc.), palm oil, and fried fish from her home and at the Pahou market in the Ouidah community, a historic village in B\u00e9nin. Josephine buys her supplies in Dantokpa, the international market of B\u00e9nin. She received a first loan from ALID\u00e9 which she repaid in full. Wanting to increase her income and grow her business, Josephine is asking for a second loan from ALID\u00e9.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Kelly Percival, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":299.34,"image":{"id":439576,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchase of 1 Basket of Peppers, 2 Baskets of Fresh Tomatoes and one Sack of Onions","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Cotonou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.35 2.433333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2009-12-03T23:40:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.66,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Josephine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":120000,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":25,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T11:28:31Z","rounded_local_amount":10865.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110623710,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T10:13:56Z","rounded_local_amount":10865.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118020415,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T08:21:13Z","rounded_local_amount":10865.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123858908,"comment":null},{"amount":15,"local_amount":6000,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-27T23:22:23Z","rounded_local_amount":6519.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":130495086,"comment":null},{"amount":29.48,"local_amount":12000,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-23T07:29:51Z","rounded_local_amount":13039.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.52,"payment_id":136619054,"comment":null},{"amount":4.86,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2010-05-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:40:20Z","rounded_local_amount":2173.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.14,"payment_id":144653007,"comment":null},{"amount":55,"local_amount":22000,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:08:41Z","rounded_local_amount":23904.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151835094,"comment":null},{"amount":60,"local_amount":24000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-30T08:14:47Z","rounded_local_amount":26078.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166953970,"comment":null},{"amount":30,"local_amount":12000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-30T08:52:00Z","rounded_local_amount":13039.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172055648,"comment":null},{"amount":30,"local_amount":12000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T12:30:14Z","rounded_local_amount":13039.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177347228,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-12-04T02:34:57Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T12:30:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":158615,"name":"Nawale","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nawale is a 43-year-old married woman with 3 children.

She is married and has 5 children, all of whom are school-aged.  This is why she began working with paper products and making crafts (shapes made of foam, felt, and other materials).  She began more than three years ago, since her husband works in a food warehouse as a loader and his income is not enough to cover the family's needs.  She chose this line of work to avoid neglecting the education and care of her children--which is her main priority, and she desires to see her children studying.  She needs more capital  to invest in her business, in order to generate higher earnings and be able to buy a computer to help her print her own designs for her crafts.

(\u201cDahlias\u201d - a type of flower), and her story is representative of the other borrowers in the group. Camila will be using this loan, her very first with Esperanza International, to purchase supplies for her beauty salon. She hopes to buy more hair products and equipment to help her work on her customers\u2019 nails. Camila came to Esperanza because she could not find credit elsewhere and to receive the health services that will be provided to her whole family.<p>\r\n\r\nCamila is a single mother, and Los Alcarrizos, a very poor area outside of the capital, Santo Domingo, is not an easy place to raise a family. Running water, if available, is never potable, electricity is scarce, and sanitation is at a minimum.

Her goal is to continue building a room for rent as she owns a zinc construction and wants to build a concrete room for rent to obtain an extra income to cover expenses as her salary is low. For this she needs to buy stone, sand, cement, iron, and floor covering in order to finish. She is succeeding with the support of Financiera Afodenic because of the low interest rate and terms.

This community is located 3\u00bd hours away from the city of Chiclayo.  \r\n<p>\r\nJunior has been working in a bakery since he was 13 years old.  His grandfather established this business in their home, where they sell products that they bake themselves in an oven located at the back of the house.  They usually sell breads, cakes, and some sweets.  This family business provides the only source of income to cover their expenses.  \r\n<p>\r\nJunior is requesting his first loan from Edpyme Alternativa in the amount of 800 soles in order to buy ingredients for making <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Panettone\" target=\"_blank\" >panettone<\/a>.  He learned how to make this delicacy a few years ago and since then, he has been preparing and selling panettone every Christmas season.    \r\n<p>\r\nJunior really enjoys what he does.  His greatest dream is to continue making the bakery successful so that they eventually become distributors.  He is an intelligent, hardworking, and very creative young man.

She is a single mother with one child, a boy, and runs her business out of her home, which she rents. Maura plans to use this loan, her third with Esperanza International, to buy new shoes and perfume to sell to her customers. She also hopes to hire an employee to help her expand her customer base and increase sales. Life in Samana can be difficult, with little access to potable water, reliable electricity and medical care. With her loan, she hopes to improve her living conditions, and will also receive health care from Esperanza International.\r\n\r\nWith her increasing profits, Maura hopes to one day move her business out of her home and into its own location. She does not like having to work in her home, and would like to create more space for her family.

Now she sews in her own home and has customers from her neighborhood. She sells Avon cosmetics, and many of her customers buy perfume, so that is what she buys to sell most often. She works part time in a workshop producing pretty dresses as well as men's suits. She is glad that so far she is doing better, as she can do her job and be able to make sales at the same time. Her plan is to be able to produce her own suits to sell.

Miguel Tlacamama community, located about 10 kilometers from Pinotepa Nacional. They are all merchants. Many people in the region sell fresh cheeses, which is the case for Isidora Alberta C., who has sold them for five years. Her siblings split up the profits, since they are the ones who own the cows and make the product themselves. They give her a percentage of the profits when she goes to sell. Now, with the loan money, she will buy the product from her siblings and start her own small business. The product sells very well in the region and is considered an inexpensive basic necessity. With the supplies she obtains, she will keep investing in her cheese-selling business and continue purchasing pigs to fatten and sell them. She has done this activity for about eight years. She considers it part of her responsibility to recuperate the loan because the group depends on continuing to receive the benefits of the foundation. She will be able to help her husband, a peasant farmer, with the expenses, and also help her children, who are eight and ten years old.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the group members are also merchants. They will use the loan money to buy and sell vegetables, groceries, fresh cheeses, and women's clothing; buy ingredients for tacos, beverages, and pork tamales; and pay to transport merchandise and ingredients to the cities of Acapulgo Guerrero and Pinotepa Nacional. Maria Apolinaria R. buys green chiles and dried fish in the Pinotepa market and resells them in villages near Tlacamama. She says that she takes care of her husband, who has a leg disease that does not allow him to work. Since they do not receive support from any of their children, it is she who has supported her family for five years. She hopes that God will help her continue to make her payments and keep receiving credit from the foundation, as she has been doing for the past two and a half years. All of the group members' principal objective is to contribute economically to their families with their day-to-day earnings, and thus improve their quality of life.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

With the help of his wife, he established a small diner in his home.  This business has helped them financially and has allowed them to pay several basic expenses that normally they would not be able to cover on his salary alone.  Due to low sales and a lack of funds, Don Manuel closed his business temporarily.  He wants to reopen the diner, but he is not able to do so because he cannot cover his household expenses.  \r\n<p>\r\nFor this reason, he has requested a loan to purchase linens and new utensils to help him provide better service.  He will also buy basic grains, rice, sugar, beans, meat, chicken, vegetables, and fruits for preparing the various dishes that his diner previously offered.

She started her business with the help of her husband, who works as a mason.  They both support one another.  Marlyn previously sold only by request, but now that her clientele has grown, she does not have sufficient funds to buy clothing and cosmetics to fulfill her orders.  She invested almost all of her money into buying shoes.  For this reason, she is requesting a loan so that she can grow her business and satisfy her buyers.  She also wants to take advantage of the Christmas season to generate more sales in hopes of earning better profits.  \r\n<p>\r\nHer goal as a mother is to have her own home.  She currently lives in her mother-in-law\u2019s house, which is small and insecure because it is partially lined with sheets of zinc.

He drives several kilometers to the capital in his own truck, which he bought using the settlement money he received as a result of an accident he suffered when he was at his previous job.  Don Etanislao was traveling by bus when he almost lost his life.  It was a difficult time in his life and it took awhile before everything could return back to normal.  He is 37 years old and lives at home with his wife and four children.  \r\n<p>\r\nThanks to God, he was able to build a house but it is far from being completed.  The walls have to be plastered, a floor has to be installed, and dividers need to go up, but the most urgent necessity is the construction of a bathroom.  The space being used at the moment is lined with black plastic and is both unsafe and uncomfortable for the children.  Don Etanislao currently lacks the money needed to enclose the bathroom and install a toilet to provide better hygiene in his home.  He plans to buy cement, sand, stone, and iron so that the work can proceed for everyone\u2019s benefit. Through his cargo business, Don Etanislao is able to feed his family.

Then he used a loan to set up a small business selling replacement parts.  Through the years he has been able to invest in it.  He has customers, but he frequently gives them credit.  Months pass before they are completely paid.  Sales are down in his business.  This is all due to the bad economy, which has covered the country.  He is not doing well with the expenses he has to pay, either.\r\n\r\nThat is why he is asking for a loan to build a wall in the back.  He will do this to be able to improve his security conditions.  There is a lot of delinquency in his neighborhood.  This way he will give his two children a better home and a better education.  All of this is because of the support the institution has given him through the loan.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":439816,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"Buy rocks, sand, cement, and iron to build a wall in the back of his house","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2009-12-03T17:20:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Victor Manuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":12000,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":52.46,"local_amount":1049.22,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T10:58:45Z","rounded_local_amount":1088.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110601901,"comment":null},{"amount":53.18,"local_amount":1063.53,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T09:52:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1103.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118003298,"comment":null},{"amount":98.82,"local_amount":1976.41,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T07:50:20Z","rounded_local_amount":2051.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128874380,"comment":null},{"amount":50.19,"local_amount":1003.73,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:30:12Z","rounded_local_amount":1041.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136604265,"comment":null},{"amount":50.22,"local_amount":1004.44,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:00:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1042.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151821511,"comment":null},{"amount":101.34,"local_amount":2026.87,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:03:22Z","rounded_local_amount":2103.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159561517,"comment":null},{"amount":50.04,"local_amount":1000.78,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T07:45:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1038.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172204354,"comment":null},{"amount":50.32,"local_amount":1006.49,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T12:03:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1044.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177330090,"comment":null},{"amount":93.43,"local_amount":1868.53,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T11:42:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1939.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182465297,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-12-28T21:18:55Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T11:42:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":158727,"name":"Komlagan","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Ce monsieur est un jeune c\u00e9libataire dynamique qui pour subvenir \u00e0 ses propres besoins s\u2019est lanc\u00e9 en 2007 dans le commerce de cartes de recharges TOGOCEL et ILLICO en gros et en d\u00e9tail.

She began as part of the Buen Samaritano group and later with the Diamante group for twelve cycles.  She is now taking out loans individually.  This is her third individual loan.  She is a very hard worker, since before her husband passed away she was in charge of maintaining the household and educating her two children, who are still young and who attend school.  With the previous loans she took out, she purchased goods for her house and for her business.  She lives in her mother's house, has good references from neighbors, and is a good borrower.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Josh Wilcox, Kiva

She had wanted to have her own business, which is a mini market.  With help from her only daughter, they have gotten ahead in spite of the fact that she raised her alone.  The problem with her business is that she has given credit, and many people have not paid.  She does not have adequate funding, and she has little inventory.  That is why she wants to buy basic grains and cosmetics like lipstick, shadow, nail polish, powder, and cologne.  She also wants to buy canned goods to prepare food.  She hopes to be able to sell more and get more customers.  With what has happened, she will not sell anymore on credit.  She has a responsibility to the institution to make monthly payments, and she has to pay basic expenses like water, light, and telephone.\r\n\r\nHer goal is to be able to make her sales grow so that in the future her daughter can depend upon her own business.

She and her husband live in Paij\u00e1n district, Ascope province, in the region of La Libertad, about three hours from the city of Chiclayo. In order to provide for her family, Carmelina used to have to travel to Chile to get work. \r\n\r\nShe returned a year ago to work in Peru doing what she most enjoys: cooking. She opened a restaurant in rented premises located on the the Panamerican highway. There she cooks a variety of traditional meals for truck drivers, tourists, and the general public. The number of customers has been increasing over the year because of the tasty food and good service. Carmelina wishes to prepare more dishes so that her business can grow, but she lacks the necessary capital. She has applied to Kiva partner Edpyme Alternativa for a loan of 1000 soles to purchase ingredients. Carmelina says that her dream is to open a restaurant in premises that she herself owns and she is working towards fulfilling that dream. \r\n\r\nCarmelina has been a client of Edpyme Alternativa before and shown herself to be responsible in the repayment of her loan installments.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jane Agg, Kiva

Los Alcarrizos can be a tough place to live with no potable running water, little access to electricity, and poor sanitation. Despite those difficulties, Joaquina is optimistic for the future. She believes that with the support of extra business profits, her children will now be able to do whatever they would like with their lives.

This group consists of eight women from the Suretka region near the Caribbean coast of Costa Rica. With this loan, Elizabeth, Lidiana and Elidieth will receive a loan to invest at their discretion. In the picture, Elizabeth is sitting in the chair in the bottom left corner. Lidiana is wearing bright red pants (3rd in from the right) and Elidieth is the second woman in from the right (wearing a turquoise shirt). These women have created The Women\u2019s Bank of M\u00e2m\u00e2rkua as a formal way to support one another as guarantors of each other\u2019s loans. This loan will be the group\u2019s second with Fundacion Mujer.\n\nThe M\u00e2m\u00e2rkua Women come from a culture that values and praises the elements of nature as well as the wisdom of elders. The word \u201cm\u00e2m\u00e2rkua\u201d signifies \u201cflower\u201d in their native language. Elizabeth, Lidiana and Elidieth are applying for loans of 200,000 colons each.\n\nIndigenous rural areas such as Suretka are characterized by many difficulties such as a lack of job opportunities, infrastructural deficiencies, low levels of formal education and lack of available financial services.\n\nThe M\u00e2m\u00e2rkua Women have adapted to their challenging situation through a communal initiative to create work for themselves by engaging in the cultivation and sale of plantains (similar to a banana but green and mainly used for cooking - a staple food in the region). For the group members, the responsibility of raising a family has fallen on their shoulders alone, rendering the revenue generated from plantain sales a vital source of income. Despite their entrepreneurial spirit, their efforts have been hamstrung, partly due to exclusion from the traditional banking system. This is where you, through Kiva\u2019s lending model, can help.\n\nEach woman has been allocated a parcel of land by the Costa Rican government, in Suretka, a region located in the province of Limon. The women use this land for the growing of plantains as well as other subsistence crops. An intermediary distributor comes to the rural village once a week to purchase plantains from the women. In a good month, each woman can earn up to 70,000 colons. The distributor sells the plantains in the closest large city, Limon. The plantains require nine months to reach maturity (one complete cycle).\n \nThe close proximity of the Suretka region to a river has resulted in a major challenge for the group. Every year, the women must cope with the inundation of their plantain crops during the rainy season. In these months, the river rises and drowns an unpredictable number of the agricultural crops which are the source of livelihood for the M\u00e2m\u00e2rkua Women and their families. \n\nTo surmount the seasonal obstacle of the rising river, the women have decided to expand their fields of cultivation to areas further away from the water. Although this may seem a simple solution, the land is a jungle, ridden with trees and undesirable weeds that need to be cleared before anything new can be planted. The women lack the resources (labour, tools) to take on this work themselves. Your loan will enable the M\u00e2m\u00e2rkua women to clear and use their land more effectively. By providing capital, the group members will be able to invest in necessary resources to clear new areas of their land for harvest at a safer distance from the rising river.\n\nThe credit consultant who has been working with The Women\u00b4s Bank of M\u00e2m\u00e2rkua over the past two years compliments the group on their punctual repayments as well as on their responsible and organized nature. Your loan is a direct investment in the betterment of the lives of women living in a poor community of Caribbean Costa Rica. By lending to these proactive and hardworking entrepreneurs, you are enabling them to help themselves.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":438796,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To facilitate the clearing of land and the planting of crops","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Suretka","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":151,"posted_date":"2009-12-18T07:10:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elidieth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lidiana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":600000,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":136647.21},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145187.66},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154261.88},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":163903.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250.52},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":266.18},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":282.81},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":300.49}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":250.52,"local_amount":136647.21,"processed_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:01:15Z","rounded_local_amount":139213.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128949177,"comment":null},{"amount":266.18,"local_amount":145187.66,"processed_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-16T07:40:31Z","rounded_local_amount":147914.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152047911,"comment":null},{"amount":282.81,"local_amount":154261.88,"processed_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T08:49:55Z","rounded_local_amount":157159.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172258649,"comment":null},{"amount":300.49,"local_amount":163903.25,"processed_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-19T09:52:27Z","rounded_local_amount":166981.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189148721,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-12-18T17:58:11Z","paid_date":"2011-01-19T09:52:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":158764,"name":"Martha Lorena","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Martha Lorena B., desde hace quince a\u00f1os, se dedica a los trabajos agr\u00edcolas, el rubro que labora es el cultivo de pi\u00f1a, la mayor dificultad por la cual enfrentan son los recursos econ\u00f3micos , el cultivo carece de fertilizantes e insumos lo cual las plagas lo han invadido a la vez el humo del volc\u00e1n  afecta  por que son tierras que quedan cerca de al volc\u00e1n , ella quiere invertir su pr\u00e9stamo en la compra de fertilizantes para proceder a inducirlo y recuperar lo que con mucho esfuerzo logro gracias al apoyo de sus mam\u00e1.  ella habita en un barrio rural del municipio de Ticuantepe , junto a su esposo el cual trabaja como guarda de seguridad para apoyarle con los gastos del hogar , ellos tienen dos hijos de doce y siete a\u00f1os , actualmente estudiante ,los planes hacia su familia es apoyarlo y mejorar las condiciones de vida .

Previously she worked in the free trade zone but they did not pay well and so she opted to quit and with her severance pay she started her small business.  She did this to earn a bit more money, since she has to cover basic expenses such as water, light, and helping her son with his studies so that he can reach a higher educational level, since his parents did not finish their education due to a lack of resources.  She has two children.  The oldest works in a store selling electrical parts to cover his own expenses, although he does not always earn enough.  Her husband works as a security guard and has a low salary, so she needs to support him so that they can pay off the bills together.  This loan will be used to increase her sales by purchasing rice, beans, sugar, corn, coffee, soft drinks, candy, cheese and other products to sell.  She plans to continue improving her house, since it is small and very simple.

widow from Barangay Remedios, Bonifacio, Misamis Occidental is the featured micro-entrepreneur. She is Mrs. Isabel B. who is 54 years old with three children. These days she is alone in the house because all her children have their own families now.\r\n\r\nTo support herself, Isabel engaged in operating a sari-sari (variety) store in her home and a dressmaking activity. This business has been in existence for almost twenty-five years already. She earns an average net income of not less than P2,000 a month which is sufficient only for her basic needs. She also receives a little share from a parcel of land, being the caretaker.\r\n\r\nIsabel is a newly recognized member of the PDP-LP (Paglaum Development Program for Landless People), a microfinance program of Paglaum MPC. She joined Paglaum MPC because she is very much interested in our products and services and for our being one of the most outstanding cooperatives in Northern Mindanao, and the awarded coop for being \u201cMost Outstanding Cooperative in the Philippines\u201d during the search for the COOP-LGU Partnership Award 2006.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis time Isabel is given the privilege of obtaining a loan of P4,000 to add to the capital of her sari-sari store and for her goods to be displayed during market day in their barangay. She is very thankful to Paglaum MPC for the trust given to her as a new member.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":436384,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To use

Hu\u1ec7 is the group leader of a four-member group loan offered by Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.  The official name of this borrowing group is 02.03.1.8 Nam Ng\u1ea1n (02.03.1.8 Nam Ng\u1ea1n).\r\n\r\n\r\nHu\u1ec7 is married and has two adult children.

Hu\u1ec7 has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1,626,900 VND from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  This previous loan was used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale.  She is now requesting a new loan of 6,000,000 VND which again will be used to purchase morer raw ingredients needed to make products for sale.  This will be her 2nd loan from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.

Business is brisk and she constantly makes close to P9, 000.00 a month in net income.  \r\nMargaret found time to attend a gathering organized for women entrepreneurs by the Center for Community Transformation (CCT) Credit Cooperative in 2008 and eventually became a member after a series of orientation sessions.  She is now applying for a loan in the amount of P15, 000.00 for the continuous operation of her business.  She will buy more grocery items to sell at her store.

The eldest of their two children is now in college and their other child is still in grade school.\r\n\r\nMercelita manages the operation of their taxi.  She also finds time making and selling home-made spring rolls and other preserved meat products.  She found it to be an interesting hobby and source of income as well.  Although she complains that subsequent oil price affects their taxi operation.  From her profits, she was able to purchase replacement tires for their taxi.\r\n\r\nShe joined the Center for Community Transformation (CCT) Credit Cooperative only this year.  She will use the funds for the preventive maintenance of the taxi.  She has been saving a lot so as to be able to buy more taxi units so she can help employ other people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout CCT\r\n\r\nThe Center for Community Transformation (CCT) is an organized Christian response against poverty and social injustice.

This group is made up of three members. These three members have requested a group loan of 20000 Afghani.   \r\n\r\nMeir Malang is the group leader. He is a man who is 38 years old. He is married, having 6 children, four sons and two daughters. He has a retail shop. And now his business income is low so he wants to expend his business and increase his business income. \r\n\r\nThe second member is Gula, who is a tailor. Before emigrating she was sewing clothes.
