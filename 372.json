She is 55 years old, a widow and mother of children who are 32, 31, 30, 29 and 15 years-old. The youngest is in school. She completed 12th grade and teacher's certificate. She lives in her own house with her two youngest children and doesn't support anyone else. \r\n\r\nShe has never left Maputo. She works with the Ministry of Education as a teacher since 1974 in the Boane District. She does not have any employees and earns 5.585.00mt per month, which goes to household expenses and a savings account. \r\n\r\nShe has had loans with another bank (BIM).  She came to know Hluvuku through her friend who is also a partner of the same institution. This loan, in the amount of 17.000.00mt is his fourth. She intends to buy building materials (cement, sand, iron, stone and tin screens) in order to continue her home improvements. The previous loans were for 10.300.00mt, 10.400.00mt and 13.500.00mt and were all applied towards the same activity. \r\n\r\nIn the future, she would like to request more loans to finish her house and provide better living conditions. \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Betyna Almeida-Covarrubias, Kiva

the past 12 years, Uralbek has worked in agriculture, raising animals. He raises cattle, which he cares for with great care, since it is thanks to them that he can cover his household expenses. Uralbek showed us his animals with great happiness as his cattle were about to be vaccinated against the various sicknesses that affect that type of livestock. \r\n\r\nUralbek considers his work very important, which is why he is currently seeking a loan in order to purchase additional young cattle so that he can earn more money in the future. This will help him generate additional income for his family. We appreciate your support for Uralbek\u2019s projects.     \r\n\r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes being a key post along the Silk Road and the location of the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. Known for its epic mountain passes, the country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous, leaving only 7 percent of arable land. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is 40 years old and married. He has five children: a 14-year-old, a 13-year-old, an 8-year-old, and 4-year-old twins. The three older children attend school. He only finished 8th grade and left school to fulfill his compulsory military service. He lives in his own house with his family, and also supports his mother, who lives with them.\r\nHe left Chibuto for Maputo in the district of Boane, where he remained to complete his military service. After leaving the military he started working in an orphanage school (Casa do Gaiato) as an upholsterer, a trade he learned from his father when he was young. He doesn't have any employees, and instead relies on his son's assistance. He brings in about 5000 meticals a month, which is enough to cover household expenses and also save a little in a bank account.\r\nHe's never received loans from other banks. He learned about Hvuluku from his neighbor, who is also a Hvuluku client. This is his second loan, in the amount of 13,000 meticals, which he will use to purchase materials (nails, springs, etc.) to continue his work. His previous loan was for 2500 meticals.\r\nHe'd like to request additional loans in the future, to be used in his business and also to finish his house and offer his family better living

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is 59 years old, married, and has 12 children. Nine of them are already adults and the 3 younger children, who are 16, 14 and 11 years old, are in school.  Salvador only finished 4th grade. He didn't continue because at the time he didn't have access to further schooling. He lives in his own house with his family, and also takes care of two relatives who live with him.\r\n\r\nSalvador never left Boane. He works as a driver for a private corporation. He doesn't have anyone working for him and brings home a monthly salary of 4900 Meticales, which he uses to cover household expenses. He also saves some money in his bank account.\r\n\r\nSalvador has never taken out a loan with another bank. He found out about Hluvuku [the Kiva Field Partner] through a friend who also works with the institution. This is his 4th loan, for the amount of 12,200 Meticales. He plans to use this money to buy construction materials (cement, stones, nails, sand and other items) in order to continue work on his construction project. His earlier loans were for 9600, 11,000 and 13,000 Meticales, and all were used for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nIn the future he would like to get more loans in order to finish his house, to offer better living conditions for his family. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Catherine Fountain, Kiva

He is 41 years old, married, and has 2 children who are 10 and 7 years old. Both of them are in school.  Albertino studied through 12th grade.

He lives in his own house with his family, and also takes care of two nephews who live with him.\r\n\r\nAlbertino left the province of Zambezia for Maputo with his family, completing his military service in 1995. Later he moved to Boane, to the neighborhood called \"2\". He has worked for the Ministry of National Defense since 1995 and has a monthly salary of 5500 Meticales, which he uses to cover household expenses. He also saves some money in his bank account.\r\n\r\nAlbertino has never taken out a loan with another bank. He found out about Hluvuku [the Kiva Field Partner] through friends who also work with the institution. This is his 4th loan, for the amount of 20,000 Meticales. He plans to use this money to buy construction materials (cement, stones, zinc plates and other items) in order to continue with the construction of his home..\r\n\r\nIn the future he would like to apply for more loans to finish his house and offer his family better living conditions.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Catherine Fountain, Kiva

is a married woman with three children, two of whom attend school. She lives in Kanyanya and sells dried fish from a rented stall in Mulago Market. With the Ush 500,000 loan, she hopes to purchase more dried fish from Lake Victoria to sell. She also sells cold drinks as she has a fridge in the market. She has been in this business for 13 years. Her greatest challenge is that the police confiscate her fish if it is too small to prevent illegal fishing. She owns a house with two rooms, which she shares with three people. They have electricity but no piped water. She takes care of two of her sisters. Her greatest expenses are school fees and food. She works seven days per week.

She got her divorce 22 years ago because her husband was a drinker and mistreated her and her children.  She has four children, now 31, 29, 27, and 22 years of age.  All of her children are married and living on their own, except for her third, a daughter who has a child.  Maria shares her house and expenses with the daughter.  She is very happy to have her own home, even if it is a little small, because she built it herself.\r\n\r\nMaria sells fruit in a stall in the Cuenca open market.  She has been doing this since she was 11 years old.  She has had her own stand only for the last 18 years.  She tells us that they had to put up a fight to get a stand, since they didn\u2019t want to turn over these stands to allow her to work without having to run around the entire market.\r\n\r\nShe is now in her third cycle, having been invited by her sister to join this group of visionary, hard-working women.  With previous loans she has increased stock for her business.  She plans to use this new loan to buy produce, such as tomatoes, onions, broccoli, cauliflower, bananas, peaches, oranges, etc., to supply her business.  \r\n\r\nMaria Guadalupe\u2019s goal is to make improvements to her house.\r\n\r\nKarina T. is also a member of the Las Lucecitas communal bank.  She is 19 years old and lives in the beautiful Totoracocha section with her husband.  They are currently expecting a child, and she is in her sixth month.  They do not yet have their own home, so live with her mother-in-law.\r\n\r\nHer husband works for a yogurt producer, and she sells food outside her home.  She has been engaged in this business for a year now, thanks to her mother, who taught her the secrets of cooking.  She now has regular customers, and begins work at 3 p.m., working until 11 p.m., at which time she stops to rest, so as to start the next day with renewed energy.\r\n\r\nKarina belongs to the communal bank thanks to a friend who invited her to join this select group of women who are successfully raising their families.  With the loan requested she will buy rice, meat, sticks, and seasoning to prepare her skewers and stews for her demanding customers.  Her greatest dream is to have her own home, which she hopes to make a reality very soon.  \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Jane Wilkie, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3425,"image":{"id":509474,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"To buy tomatoes, onion, broccoli, cauliflower, bananas, peaches, oranges, and other fruits and vegetables to stock her business.

","en":"The San Nicol\u00e1s Communal Bank is represented by Se\u00f1ora Carmen del Rosario.  It consists of 11 members, all of whom are hardworking women like Carmen del Rosario, who sells lottery tickets in different markets in El Alto and cosmetics through catalogues (the cosmetics are in a catalogue which she shows to her customers).  She is married and has two small children who don\u2019t yet go to school.  She rents her home, but her greatest dream is to be able to buy a house so that she can give her children a more comfortable place to live. Her loan will be used for the purchase of materials for a stall for selling lottery tickets and a small plot of land.\r\n<p>\r\nThe rest of the group has different businesses such as the sale of clothing, food, chickens, cosmetics, electronic equipment, groceries, and crafts.  Most of them are established in the San Nicol\u00e1s area, hence the name of the group.\r\n<p>\r\nIn general, the members bring a lot of competence to their businesses.  They know how to get ahead offering quality products at low prices.\r\n<p>\r\nThe loan will be used for increasing working capital through the purchase of inventory and raw materials that allow increases in their income which enable them to give their families a better quality of life.  The group is embarking on its third loan cycle with this institution and has demonstrated responsibility and the desire to progress and increase the wellbeing of their families.\r\n<br

He knows very well how his communal bank works.  Therefore, he has promised to be in charge of the good development of this group.  Meanwhile, he is requesting 1,500 PEN to buy several sacks of fertilizer.  He will also contract the services of three workers to maintain and clean the land where he grows his crops.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":510063,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Buy fertilizer and hire three workers to clean and cultivate his banana and coffee fields","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-03-20T19:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cesar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2010-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2010-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2010-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2010-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2010-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2010-11-06T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2010-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2011-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":150}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:38:19Z","rounded_local_amount":150.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136718180,"comment":null},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:40:10Z","rounded_local_amount":150.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751855,"comment":null},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:03:06Z","rounded_local_amount":150.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151934315,"comment":null},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:37:16Z","rounded_local_amount":150.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159673087,"comment":null},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:52Z","rounded_local_amount":150.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166886912,"comment":null},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:23Z","rounded_local_amount":150.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172153915,"comment":null},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:14:48Z","rounded_local_amount":150.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449259,"comment":null},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:59:51Z","rounded_local_amount":150.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182587996,"comment":null},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:05:15Z","rounded_local_amount":150.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188724623,"comment":null},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:40:11Z","rounded_local_amount":150.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191462834,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-03-22T03:37:01Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T04:40:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":186635,"name":"Alicia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Sra.

They live near Viloma GranD., in an agricultural area of Sipe-Sipe, in Quillacollo province.\r\n\r\nFrancisca works in agriculture together with her family, and they also produce raw milk. With great effort, she and her family were recently able to acquire a small property. Her husband has been unable to obtain work that would generate more income, because he has suffered an accident and has problems with his joints, so he is limited in his activities. For this reason, he only works cultivating his land. The family has two small buildings on the land, which incluD. their bedrooms. They cook on an open fire using wood and clay pots. Francisca is a woman who is always seeking to proviD. a better life for her children, including better food, health and education. However, she herself has never received anything, since her parents abandoned her when she was 12, and she began working in the neighborhood, helping her neighbors with the cleaning and farm work. Through this she learned the traD. of farming, and now she can earn her own money. \r\n\r\nShe is requesting this loan to buy a milk cow to increase her milk production, as well as some seeds, so that she can increase her income and proviD. her family with a better standard of living. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman, Kiva

Her business is basically about buying and selling fish.  She distributes it to important cities in the country like Manta and Guyayaquil.  You could say that the business is strictly a family business.  This interesting small businesswoman and her sister work day to day to get ahead.\r\n\r\nShe has been in the business for 15 years.  Rosa learned from her father because he has also been in this business for many years.  To get the business ahead, they make several systematic purchases.  They invest between 400 and 500 dollars in each purchase.  They stock up on the product directly in the port of Manta.  Her sister sells in Quito.  Her sister travels there to sell every so often depending on the sales and the demand in this great city.  In each sale they earn approximately 100% of what they invested.\r\n\r\nRosa\u2019s biggest dream is to be able to continue in her business.  The money she is requesting is to be able to continue increasing her business.  It is to offer the best to the consumers and vendors of the product.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

Parallel to this work, he is dedicated to interprovincial transportation since he has two vehicles. He has 15 years experience with this activity. The manager is his eldest daughter. Meanwhile, the farming work is performed by operators who watch over and take care of the development and production of their crops. His wife is dedicated to the daily preparation of food then she brings lunch to the farms. What he likes most about his work is to sow maize and alfalfa greens which he takes care of until harvest time. It is also profitable so he could buy their vehicles, generating good additional income from the sale of maize and produce in the central market of their city.

Along with her husband Osvaldo, who is an interprovincial salaried driver, she sells her product in the mining areas. She sells her blankets to salespeople at the markets in the highlands. She sells her blankets in the morning and constructs them in the afternoon. She makes handmade, crochet blankets out of alpaca wool. (The alpaca is delicate footed herd animal with a slim body covered with fiber that she gathers for fleece. They have padded feet that allow them to tread lightly on the grass. The animals don\u2019t damage the ecology of the region or cause erosion. Alpaca wool is high quality. For many hundreds of years other countries have tried to acquire alpacas.  Foreign countries have not been able to maintain alpaca herds. Alpacas don\u2019t reproduce unless they live on open land. Per\u00fa and Bolivia have signed international treaties in order to assure their monopoly over the alpaca, as they are their national legacy.) She sells her blankets to the wholesale and retail markets, depending on the requests that she has. With this loan she will buy wholesale alpaca wool and use it to make her blankets. Her major goal is to grow her business and have her own house.

They live in their own home.  She has five grown children who are all independent and have their own families.\r\n<p>\r\nFor 45 years Florencia has been farming and holding a major influence on the decision making, since she has great support from her husband.  She supervises the work of her laborers who are charged with looking after the crops of corn, potatoes, and other vegetables that are grown on her land.  Even though an illness prevents her from performing strenuous activity, this does not keep her away from the production of her crops.  Her husband operates a locksmith shop in a rented location, where he also manufactures door and windows.  In his spare time, he helps Florencia with the work in the fields.  \r\n<p>\r\nWhat she enjoys most is irrigating her crops because, according to her, the sight of running water flowing through the furrows helps to distract her.  However, the most difficult part of her job is washing the beets and cauliflower before they are taken to the city market.  From the profits she has earned, Florencia was able to establish her husband\u2019s shop.  They both want to expand this business so that he will have more equipment to facilitate his work as a locksmith.  Their greatest wish is to open a hardware store or an iron distribution center.  \r\n<p>\r\nFlorencia is taking her tenth loan with MFP and hopes to achieve her goal.  She is also very proud to be continuing her work with her Communal Bank, which led to making progress alongside her family and learning how to invest her loan proceeds.

He is compensated, however, by the income that he brings in from the sale of the vegetables he harvests. Thanks to this income he was able to buy furniture for his house and was able to buy another plot of land, in order to gain yet more income. Erik and his wife plan to buy a house with a large amount of land for growing food, and also a truck to take their products to the markets in their city. \r\n\r\nThis is Erik's third loan with MFP [the Kiva field partner], and he hopes to use it to improve his ventures in agriculture and his finances.

They are always looking for a way to work through these issues and get ahead along with their families. This bank is located in the city of Cuenca, in a community called Chilcato Tora, hence the bank's name. This area is characterized by beautiful Andean landscapes with native vegetation. The people who live there work in agriculture and cattle raising.  \r\n\r\nGloria got married young, and now at age 20 she has a three-year-old son. Her husband works patching walls. They don't have their own house and so they live with her husband's mother although they are financially independent. \r\n\r\nGloria works raising animals such as pigs, chickens, and cows, both for sale and for her own family's use. The milk produced by her cows is only for the family's use, and she sells her animals to the people in her community in order to be able to cover any unexpected expenses.\r\n\r\nGloria is a happy young woman and she enjoys a friendly relationship with all of the other members of her communal bank. She has been working with the bank for two loan cycles. With this loan she wants to buy chickens, and vitamins and feed to raise and sell them. Her greatest dream is to be able to build her own house.  \r\n\r\nCarmen C. is 60 years old and was widowed 29 years ago when her husband was hit by a car. She also lost one child of the seven that she carried. Her three oldest children are married and the other three, who are single, live with her in the house she owns. They help her out in paying the household expenses. \r\n\r\nCarmen also works raising chickens, pigs and cows. She either sells the milk she gets from her cows to a delivery truck or uses it at home. She sells her animals in the neighboring community. She has told us that she's been doing this hard work for eleven years and that she learned it from her parents. Her work has helped to allow her children to get ahead in life. \r\n\r\nCarmen is in her second loan cycle and with this loan she will buy chickens and feed in order to continue with her work. Her goal is to build a warehouse in order to expand her chicken raising operation.  \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Catherine Fountain, Kiva

She sells her products to her neighbors, who are very satisfied. She has the support and help of her children which makes it easier to continue with her business. Additionally, she believes this endeavor is very interesting as she has seen how her business generates earnings and grows little by little as demand increases.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Marjorie is asking for a microloan of  \u00a2657,000 (six hundrend fifty seven thousand colones) for the purchase of more chickens and hens, concentrate, and supplies for the treatment of diseases. With it, she expects to grow her business and improve her quality of life. Her business is doing well but because of lack of capital, she has been unable to grow it even more. With the loan she's asking for she expects to increase sales, thereby improving the economic conditions of her family.\r\n\r\nMarjorie belongs to the \"Empresa de Cr\u00e9dito Comunal Emcrecoba,\" one of the 100 partner organizations for EDESA in Costa Rica.

Es as\u00ed que se dedica a esta actividad, siendo su tienda la preferida de sus vecinos, pues su manera tan amable de atender a las personas que le visitan su tienda, hace que gane la atenci\u00f3n de ellos. Paralelamente a su trabajo, se dedica tambi\u00e9n a la siembra ma\u00edz, alverja, papa y cebada, cultivados en terrenos propios que tiene y gracias a la ayuda de operarios, es que a\u00fan conserva esta actividad.\nDe esta manera la venta de comestibles le ha sido rentable, permiti\u00e9ndole cubrir sus gastos, por lo que espera mas adelante ampliar su tienda para vender m\u00e1s productos que son muy solicitados por sus clientes. En un futuro desea tener un local comercial, que le permitan dar m\u00e1s utilidades. Este es su octavo cr\u00e9dito con MFP, por lo que espera concretar sus planes. Adem\u00e1s como integrante de su grupo comunal, ha aprendido a valorar  el esfuerzo que emprende cada uno de sus compa\u00f1eros para efectuar puntualmente cada pago, es por eso que le agrada laborar a lado de ellos. Con los tres mil nuevos soles que solicita, comprar\u00e1 productos para abastecer su tienda, asimismo desea comprar una bolsa de semilla de alverja y 5 sacos de abono para continuar con su actividad agr\u00edcola. \n","en":"Mardonia, 36, is very attentive and hard-working.  She lives in her mother,  Alejandrina\u2019s, 66, house.  She cares for her mother, her two sisters and two nieces that also live with her.  She has sold groceries for the last 7 years in a locale her parents gave her.\r\n\r\nHer store is her neighbors\u2019 favorite because of the kindness she shows to those who come to her store.  In conjunction with her store, she also farms; she grows corn, pea, potato and barley on her own farmlands.  Thanks to help from field hands, she still has this commercial activity.\r\n\r\nGrocery sales have been a profitable endeavor which has produced enough for her to meet basic expenses.  She hopes to enlarge her store later on to sell more products that are in high demand by her customers.  In the future, she\u2019d like to have a commercial location that will allow for higher profits.\r\n\r\nThis is her 8th loan with MFP which she hopes will help her consolidate her plans.  In addition, as a member of a communal group, she has learned to value the effort which each member places into repaying each installment on time; this is why she likes to work with them so much.\r\n\r\nShe will use the 3000 new soles to buy stock items for her store as well as a sack of pea seed and 5 sacks of manure to continue with her farming activity.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":510244,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":" To buy stock items for her store as well as pea seed and manure.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-03-21T03:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mardonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1050}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1050,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:28Z","rounded_local_amount":3005.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172153922,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-03-22T19:09:04Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":186735,"name":"Ramiro Antonio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ramiro de 48 a\u00f1os de edad es soltero, labora para el MINED desde hace 25 a\u00f1os, vive en union libre con la Sra.

He is single and lives with her younger sister Eutenia and niece Xianela, in the house he inherited from his parents. The devotion he had towards his mother while she was living caused Felix not to have his own family. However, that didn't make him want to work any less, that is why she's been working for 40 years growing peas, potatoes, corn, and other vegetables in his own land and with help that he has hired. He is still able to take care of his land and his sister supports him by preparing his lunch every day. Additionally, he is also a bricklayer. He always made an effort to provide for his loved ones and that's why he likes his job and the reason that he is consided a father by his own family. What he enjoys most is to grow peas since he likes to see  how the plant grows. In the future he plans to repair and improve his house so that his nephews can have it. Additionally, he wants to rent his land so that he can increase his earnings and continue savings and thereby secure his retirement. This is his tenth loan with MFP. He is glad to belong to his communal group because it is very organized and taught him how to save.

She is on her fifth loan, aged 42 and married. She is the mother of 10 children, among whom six are enrolled in school and three others are not because she can't pay school fees. Her husband has a little job working as a driver for an individual. \r\n\r\nAmani started up her little business selling charcoal with her own funds, received from her husband, in the amount of about 10 USD. Her business consists in selling charcoal in a little market located in the urban\/rural zone of Ndosho, 12 km from the center of the town of Goma. It must be noted that before opening this business, Amani had already begun selling tomatoes on a small scale. \r\n\r\nWith the loan from the MFI Hekima, Amani hopes to increase her turnover by buying six sacks of charcoal and 4 baskets of tomatoes.

He is dedicated to the manufacturing of rubber bushings for docks and shock absorbers for cars. He has been in this profession for over 6 years. He lives in his parents in law\u2019s house, and in general he wins contracts from mechanical companies because he excels in his work. He has agreed to the loan with a preferential rate since he is a good client and responsible with his payments. The proceeds of the credit are for purchasing more tires to make more bushings. First he started as a bushing assistant, and slowly he got his own capital and opened his own bushing shop. Mr. Francisco\u2019s wish is to have his own home.

She lived in a precarious house made of adobe, rented in the Ticti zone in the north. Ms. Alcira is a hard working woman, and this is why she agreed to a preferential Kiva rate because she is a very responsible and punctual woman. She used to be an ambulatory saleswoman in a market in the region but the deputies from the mayor\u2019s office kicked her out since it is not allowed to be an ambulatory salesman in the markets; it is necessary to have a stall. She has now improved the quality of her family's life. She will use the proceeds of this loan to purchase merchandise in bulk, to be able to sell it to her customers since she now has a lot of orders. Ms. Alcira\u2019s wish is to have her own little house and see her sons as professionals. She is very grateful to Emprender and Kiva for the confidence in providing her with this loan.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Esteban Riojas, Kiva

Today, Pedro manages his crops well and farms basic grains, which is one of the main activities in this region.  Prior to this, he used to help his father raise cattle.\r\n\r\nHe hopes that this loan will allow him to make some improvements to his farm because he needs to invest in next year\u2019s harvest in order to get good yields.\r\n\r\nPedro Alonso is married and has six children only two of whom, one in secondary school and one in elementary school, are still school-aged and under his care.\r\n\r\nThis is Pedro\u2019s third loan with Ceprodel; he has been collaborating with the institution since 2001.  He states that Ceprodel loans have helped him a great deal in that he has improved both his farm and his family\u2019s standard of living.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":510556,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"For coffee crop maintenance.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Condega","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":74,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pedro Alonso ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":6400,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":6400}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":186820,"name":"Ruth Samary","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ruth Samary de 28 a\u00f1os de edad, es soltera  labora como docente de la Escuela Alfonso Cortes de Nueva Guinea desde hace 8 a\u00f1os, tiene una bebe de 4 a\u00f1os y seis meses,esta solicitando su 4to cr\u00e8dito  para comprar mareiales de construcci\u00f2n y lograr repellar y hecarle el piso a una habitaci\u00f2n, para asi tener mejor comodidad en el hogar, su compa\u00f1ero de vida labora como agricultor en la finca de sus padres y le ayuda con los gastos familiares, con el credito anterior logro construir una habitacion, este es el segundo credito que tramita para mejoras de vivienda y expresa que se siente muy agradecida por el apoyo brindado por el fondo kiva, su sue\u00f1o para el futuro es seguri mejorando poco a poco las condicones de vida de su familia y seguri estudiando para ser una mejor profesional.","en":"Ruth Samary is 28 years old, single, and has a 4\u00bd year old child.

She has two children who are 20 and 24 years old.  One works and the other is a student.  She began teaching as soon as she finished her studies.  The problem that she has now is that they have decreased the number of class hours she gives so she makes less.  She and her husband together built the entire cement house but they still need to stucco the walls, paint and put in ceramic tiles.  This is why she opted for financing, in order to advance more quickly because she had been improving her home little by little.  Her plans are to be able to retire and start an Avon cosmetics business with display cases.

For five years, Reuben has been selling jeans at the Red Light Market in Paynesville, which is near Monrovia.  He says he sells the jeans in an encouraging manner, which keeps customers returning.  One of the challenges he faces is that there are many competitors in the market. Reuben plans to use his 6,000 Liberian dollar portion of this 30,000 Liberian dollar group loan to buy more jeans.  His goal is to open a beauty salon one day.

She is in charge of running the warehouse for her father's mechanic shop. She has two children. Her oldest son Ramiro is 19 and lives with his grandmother because she lives alone. Her daughter Belen is only four years old and is in pre-school. Thanks to a housing project in the Forests of Juigalpan residential development Carolina was able to purchase her own home with a long-term mortgage. The house has an unimproved floor and because her daughter is little and likes playing on the floor she would like a second loan to improve the house using ceramic tiles and thus avoid potential illnesses for her daughter. Carolina's dream is to have a beautiful home with all the necessities for her family to live in a comfortable environment. She also hopes that her children are upstanding people and that in the future they become professionals and help improve their country.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patrick King,

For 35 years, Sonnie has been selling dried fish and palm oil at the Red Light Market in Paynesville, which is near Monrovia.  She says that she provides her customers with high quality dried fish and palm oil, which keeps them coming to her for business.  One of her challenges is that sometimes sales in the market can be slow. Sonnie plans to use her 6,000 Liberian dollar portion of this 30,000 Liberian dollar group loan to buy more dried fish and palm oil.

Her business is selling soup, rice, and cold water at the Red Light Market, located on the outskirts of Liberia's capital Monrovia.  She says she will use her 6,000 Liberian dollar portion of this 26,000 Liberian dollar loan to buy rice, oil, fish, and charcoal to use at her food stall.\r\n\r\nSando is 32 years old, married, and has one boy and two girls, aged 11, 14, and 18, respectively.  Her children are all in school.  Sando herself was only able to complete school through the 9th grade due to the Liberian civil war, which disrupted her education.\r\n\r\nBesides her children, Sando also helps care for her younger brother, who is 23 and lives with at her house with her family.\r\n\r\nSando started her business selling prepared food -- soup and rice -- about seven years ago.  She says she started small, selling cold water out of a container with only three cups to serve her customers.  Her business has grown, but it's hard work.  She wakes most days at 5:30 in the morning, is at the market by 8, and stays until dusk.

P. is from the village of Sulangon. She is 59 years old. Lydia is married and has five adult-aged children. To make a living, Lydia owns and operates a retail store, selling a variety of products including shampoo, soap and toothpaste in the local community. Lydia has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately $116 a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Lydia joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Lydia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from PMPC. That loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Lydia is requesting a new loan of 14,000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. This will be her 7th loan from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

Saturnina L. is from the village of Dimaluna, Ozamiz City. She is 45 years old, married, and has two adult and two school-aged children. Saturnina owns and operates a sari-sari (variety) store selling home products. She has been engaged in her business for ten years and earns approximately 2,000 PHP a month.\n\nIn July 2009, Saturnina joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from PMPC. Saturnina is requesting a new loan of 14,995 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional grocery stocks. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family and to save for future emergencies.\n\nAbout PMPC:\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":509108,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation.  A higher number represents a higher score.  For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.  \n\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\n\nAbout  SPBD \nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.

She owns a business venture, selling pancakes (fried flour pancakes flavored with lemon or coconut jam).  Talafua has 5 years of experience in this business.  Talafua needs a loan of WST $2250 to purchase additional products to sell.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to financially support immediate members of her family.\r\n\r\nTalafua joined SPBD.  This is her 4th loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Talafua's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Talafua M. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.7 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress.  The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation.  A higher number represents a higher score.  For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.  \r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.  \r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD

C. is 36 and married with 6 children.  She owns a business venture, providing clothing alteration & tailoring services to local community members.  Siupolu has 4 years of experience in this business.  Siupolu needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase additional fabrics & materials.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 550 talas or US $229 per week) to make improvements to her house.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Siupolu joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Siupolu's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Siupolu C. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.7 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress.  The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation.  A higher number represents a higher score.  For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.  \r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.  \r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD

S. is a 27-year-old married man and a resident of Kompong Thmor, which is a commune in Kompong Tom Province. He is married to Sophy, 27, and they have been blessed with two young kids. Neither of the kids is enrolled in school. His wife, who appears in the photo here, raises a few pigs in a stall next to their house to earn a living. In order to make a living, S. earns money from fishing and selling chop-wood.

She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 750 talas or US $313 per week) to financially support immediate members of her family.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Maria  joined SPBD.

SPBD's loans are Maria 's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Maria Y. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.7 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.

 M. is 48 and married with 5 children.  She owns a business venture, raising pigs for sale.  Faatoaga  has 5 years of experience in this business.  Faatoaga  needs a loan of WST $1250 to build shelter for the borrower's livestock.  She plans to use the earnings from her business  to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Faatoaga  joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Faatoaga 's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Faatoaga  M. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.7 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

B. is from the village of San Jose. She is 50 years old. Vivian is married and has 11 school-aged children. To make a living, Vivian owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for sale. Vivian has been engaged in her business for over 30 years and earns approximately $75 a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Vivian joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Vivian has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future. Vivian is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used for the same purpose. This will be her 3rd loan from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

 P. is 23 and married with 3 children.  She owns a business venture, raising fish for sale.  Tina  has many years of experience in this business.  Tina  needs a loan of WST $1500 purchase fishing gears and a new canoe.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 750 talas or US $313 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Tina  joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Tina 's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Tina  P. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.7 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

P. is 25 and married with 2 children.  She owns a business venture, selling BBQ (sausages, chicken, plantains).  Temukisa has 2 years of experience in this business.  Temukisa needs a loan of WST $1500 to buy BBQ meat, ketchup, plastic plates & utensils, and coal.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 650 talas or US $271 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Temukisa joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Temukisa's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Temukisa P. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.7 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

Sipiu needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase additional products to sell.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Sipiu joined SPBD.  This is her 1st loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Sipiu's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Sipiu T. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.65 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

S. is 42 and married with 4 children (ages 12 - 25).  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Eseta has 1 year of experience in this business.  Eseta needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 talas or US $188 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nYou can view pictures of a typical plantation in Samoa, taken by a Kiva Fellow, at:   http:\/\/picasaweb.google.com\/agnes.p.chu\/SamoanPlantation\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Eseta joined SPBD.    This is her 1st loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Eseta's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Eseta S. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.6 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.65 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

B. is from the town of Poblacion, Sapang Dalaga, Misamis Occidental. She is 31 years old. Gina is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Gina owns and operates a business selling fruits like bananas in the local community. Gina has been engaged in her business for over twelve years and earns approximately $75 a month from this activity.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Gina joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Gina has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Gina is requesting a new loan of 6,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. This will be her 2nd loan from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

L. is 45 and married with 6 children (ages 6 - 24).  She owns a business venture, selling cigarettes.  Rachel has 3 years of experience in this business.  Rachel needs a loan of WST $1700 to purchase additional products to sell.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 350 talas or US $146 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\n\nIn 2008, Rachel joined SPBD.    This is her 3rd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Rachel's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\n\nAbout SPBD\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\n\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

S. is 46 and married with 5 children (ages 11 - 20).  She owns a business venture, selling puletasi (Samoan formal wear).  Telesia has 3 years of experience in this business.  Telesia needs a loan of WST $1750 to purchase additional fabrics & materials.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 550 talas or US $229 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Telesia joined SPBD.  This is her 4th loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Telesia's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Telesia S. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.6 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.5 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She owns a business venture, selling wood handicrafts to tourists and local community members.  Malia has many years of experience in this business.  Malia needs a loan of WST $1750 to purchase additional handicrafts to sell.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nYou can view pictures\/video of fine mat weaving, taken by a Kiva Fellow, at:   http:\/\/picasaweb.google.com\/agnes.p.chu\/WeavingFineMats#\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Malia joined SPBD.    This is her 4th loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Malia's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Malia M. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.65 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.5 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.5 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

P. is 28 and married with no children.  She owns a business venture, selling traditional handicrafts to tourists and local community members.  Sina has many years of experience in this business.  Sina needs a loan of WST $1750 to purchase raw materials to make additional handicrafts.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 550 talas or US $229 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Sina joined SPBD.  This is her 3rd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Sina's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Sina P. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.6 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.65 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Geraldine B. is from the village of Tru-cut Sapang Dalaga, Misamis Occidental. She is 27 years old. Geraldine is the group leader of a 3 member group loan offered by GDMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Tundan 1.\r\n\r\nGeraldine is married and has 1 infant. Geraldine owns and operates a business selling fruit products like watermelon, bananas, etc. in the local community. Geraldine has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 8,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Geraldine joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Geraldine has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional inventory and for working capital.\r\n\r\nGeraldine is requesting a new loan of 6,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Geraldine from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n\r\n<b>About GDMPC:<\/b>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n \r\n<font size=\"1\"> <b>*Note:<\/b> To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

P. is 48 and married with 5 children (ages 15 - 28).  She owns a business venture, selling dairy products in the local community.  Faatupu has many years of experience in this business.  Faatupu needs a loan of WST $1750 to buy raw ingredients for cooked foods.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Faatupu joined SPBD.    This is her 4th loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Faatupu's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Faatupu P. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.5 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.65 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she was able to borrow quite a few times from CCT\u2019s Cooperative.  She is consistent in paying her dues because she used the money she borrowed to expand and improve her eatery.     \r\n\r\nNow, with your help, she would like to apply for a PHP 35,000 loan. This amount will be used as a source of added capital for her expanding business so she can buy the raw ingredients needed to continue production of her recipes.\r\n\r\nShe dreams that her business will continue to grow so that she can provide her children with a good, comfortable and well-off future.\r\n\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

 S. is 36 and married with 4 children (ages 2 - 16).  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Elenoa  has many years of experience in this business.  Elenoa  needs a loan of WST $1250 to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 talas or US $188 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Elenoa  joined SPBD.  This is her 3rd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Elenoa 's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Elenoa  S. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.65 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.5 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

M. is 37 and married with 3 children (ages 4 - 16).  She owns a business venture, selling baked goods in the local community.  Fiapule has 2 years of experience in this business.  Fiapule needs a loan of WST $800 to buy raw ingredients for cooked foods.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Fiapule joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Fiapule's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Fiapule M. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.65 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.5 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.5 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

 F. is 45 and married with 5 children (ages 4 - 18).  She owns a business venture, selling baked goods in the local community.  Faima  has many years of experience in this business.  Faima  needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase additional products to sell.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 talas or US $188 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Faima  joined SPBD.  This is her 3rd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Faima 's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Faima  F. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.5 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.5 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

The official name of this borrowing group is Guava 1.\r\n\r\nMarilyn is married and has 2 infant children. Marilyn owns and operates a business selling daily use products such as sugar, shampoo, noodles, soap and toothpaste in the local community. Marilyn has been engaged in her business for over 6 years and earns approximately 8,500 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Marilyn joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Marilyn is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Marilyn from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n\r\n<b>About GDMPC:<\/b>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

SPBD's loans are Foloi 's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Foloi  J. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.8 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Iutana joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Iutana's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Iutana F. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.87 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score.

T. is 39 and married with 2 children (ages 9 and 11).  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Nora has 1 year of experience in this business.  Nora needs a loan of WST $1500 to invest in expanding the business.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Nora joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Nora's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Nora T. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.87 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

M. is 47 and married with 4 children (ages 9 - 22).  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Folo has many years of experience in this business.  Folo needs a loan of WST $1500 to invest in expanding the business.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 600 talas or US $250 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Folo joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Folo's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Folo M. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.87 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Koreti has many years of experience in this business.  Koreti needs a loan of WST $1750 to invest in expanding the business.  She plans to use the earnings from her business o improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Koreti joined SPBD.  This is her 3rd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Koreti's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Koreti F. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.87 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Telesia has many years of experience in this business.  Telesia needs a loan of WST $1000 to invest in expanding the business.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Telesia joined SPBD.    This is her 1st loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Telesia's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Telesia I. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.87 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

.I. is 20 and single with no children.  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting fishing.  Rosalia has 6 years of experience in this business.  Rosalia needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase harvesting equipment such as wheelbarrows, shovels, rakes, baskets, and knives.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Rosalia joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Rosalia's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Rosalia .I. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.87 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She owns a business venture, providing dress making services to local community members.  Valasi has 2 years of experience in this business.  Valasi needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase additional fabrics & materials.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 260 talas or US $108 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Valasi joined SPBD.    This is her 1st loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Valasi's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Valasi L. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.3 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.3 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.3 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

P. is 40 and married with 8 children.  She owns a business venture, 0.  Ake has 3 years of experience in this business.  Ake needs a loan of WST $1500 to buy raw ingredients for cooked foods.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 260 talas or US $108 per week) to financially support immediate members of her family.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Ake joined SPBD.  This is her 3rd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Ake's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Ake P. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.3 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.3 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.4 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

A. is 29 and married with 3 children (ages 9 - 11).  She owns a business venture, providing dress making services to local community members.  Jacinta has 3 years of experience in this business.  Jacinta needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase additional fabrics & materials.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 300 talas or US $125 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Jacinta joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Jacinta's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Jacinta A. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.3 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.3 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.4 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Emele joined SPBD.  This is her 1st loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Emele's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Emele M. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She owns and operates a general store, selling a variety of different products like soft drinks, rice, sugar, shampoo, etc., in the local community. She has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Jessie joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She is requesting a loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding her business. This loan will be her first from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from his business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About GDMPC:<\/b>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

 A. is 42 and married with 4 children.  She owns a business venture, selling ice-cakes (flavored ice in styrofoam cups).  Leutogi  has 2 years of experience in this business.  Leutogi  needs a loan of WST $1250 to buy sugar, styrofoam cups, and codial (flavoring).  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Leutogi  joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Leutogi 's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Leutogi  A. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.

E. is 43 and married with 10 children.  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Gagae has 1 year of experience in this business.  Gagae needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 300 talas or US $125 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Gagae joined SPBD.  This is her 1st loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Gagae's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Gagae E. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

This is her 1st loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Juliana Haine 's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Juliana Haine  T. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.
