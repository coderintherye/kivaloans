This school was founded in 1982 by the Kulafai Rashedeen Mission. The school is currently staffed with 37 teachers and has an enrollment of 550 pupils. This is the first loan that teachers of this institution have benefited from Kiva lenders. \n\nEdward F. is a teacher at the school and leader of this group. Edward is approximately forty year old and was born in Lunsar, in northern Sierra Leone. He has been in the teaching profession for fourteen years now. Edward is married and has four children. He has requested for a loan of SLL 800,000.00 in order to invest in business. Edward will buy locally produce goods like palm-oil and rice at large quantity for sale. \n\nSchool staff from this institution, like many other schools staff within SMT\u2019s operational areas, come to SMT to apply for loans. With the help of these loans, they can accomplish some certain tasks that they would otherwise have not been able to accomplish with their mere salaries alone. But with the help of this loan, some can pay school fees for their children; others can use the loan to buy pieces of furniture, a plot of land, house-building materials, or invest in business. At the end of each month, these teachers can repay the loan out of their monthly salaries. The institution\u2019s bursar is directly responsible for deducting the repayment and pays SMT on their behalf.\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2575,"image":{"id":714682,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"Buys locally produce goods like palm-oil and rice at large quantity for sale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Lunsar","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"8.5 -11.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2011-03-11T05:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edward \t","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marie ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mohamed S.

When she started the business her goal was to find an alternative way to provide for her children; however, her business has helped her improve her life. Now her children have the chance to study. Currently she is applying for a loan to purchase more merchandise, principally basic grains, so that she can sell more both on cash and credit. She dreams of having a large business in the market which would allow her to provide for her entire family.\r\n \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":715045,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"Capital for business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2011-02-19T05:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":825,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Andrea Del Socorro","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-02-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":18000,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2011-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2011-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2011-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2011-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2011-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2011-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2011-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2011-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2011-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2012-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2012-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":68.82,"local_amount":1501.6,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:05:39Z","rounded_local_amount":1515.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201287066,"comment":null},{"amount":68.78,"local_amount":1500.57,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:01:31Z","rounded_local_amount":1514.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206155115,"comment":null},{"amount":70.16,"local_amount":1530.86,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:15:11Z","rounded_local_amount":1545.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211227987,"comment":null},{"amount":70.3,"local_amount":1533.92,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:06:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1548.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216506754,"comment":null},{"amount":68.31,"local_amount":1490.5,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-16T08:05:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1504.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221670809,"comment":null},{"amount":70.78,"local_amount":1544.2,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T09:13:11Z","rounded_local_amount":1558.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227039508,"comment":null},{"amount":67.9,"local_amount":1481.35,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-18T07:58:58Z","rounded_local_amount":1495.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":233214479,"comment":null},{"amount":70.87,"local_amount":1546.33,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-18T09:31:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1560.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":239090248,"comment":null},{"amount":67.81,"local_amount":1479.51,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:56:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1493.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244565327,"comment":null},{"amount":201.27,"local_amount":4391.16,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-21T08:55:20Z","rounded_local_amount":4432.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":251669202,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-02-22T08:41:17Z","paid_date":"2012-01-21T08:55:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":274575,"name":"Erlinda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Sra.

It has 6 members, women who are neighbors and know each other. Clara Antonia R. R\u00edos will use her loan to buy pots, pans, and bulk peanuts to sell.  Esmeralda Maribel R\u00edos Guti\u00e9rrez is going to buy bulk peanuts and candy (peanut brittle and jamoncillo--candy made with milk, sugar and ground pumpkin seeds) to sell.  Rosalina Roberta L. C. is going to buy packages of wafers to recut them into different sizes and sell them by the box.  Imelda Mar\u00edn Vel\u00e1zquez is going to buy bulk peanuts, peanut brittle, alegr\u00eda (amaranth candy), tamarind, jamoncillo, and coconut cookies to sell.  Anadeli L. P\u00e9rez is going to buy bulk peanuts, bulk sweet potatoes, and corn to sell.  Maleni N. R\u00edos is going to buy catalogues and supply her first orders.  \r\n\r\nEsmeralda Maribel R\u00edos Guti\u00e9rrez is 38 years old and studied through the third year of secondary school, obtaining her certificate.  She is married and has three children: Jorge, 14 years old, who attends secondary school; Wilbert, 16 years old, studying for his bachillerato (a level between secondary school and college); and Maleni, 18 years old, who works making typical candy and peanuts.  Esmeralda is asking for the loan to buy brown sugar, honey, peanuts, amaranth, tamarind, and sugar.  She has a business selling candies.  The products she offers are alegr\u00eda, peanut brittle, jamoncillo, tamarind, chilacayote (squash), and sweet potatoes.  She has been doing this since she was little; her parents were in the business and taught her.  It has been her family heritage for generations.  In the beginning, her raw material suppliers gave her credit, and she paid later, but some of the other customers did not pay.  Now they don't give credit, and she has to pay cash for what she buys.\r\n\r\nShe goes to sell her candies at the fair in Amecameca in the market stalls. She goes to Cuautla, to Yecapixtla, and to Ozumba.  Her customers are all kinds of people: men, women, children, young women.  She buys a ticket or takes public transportation to get to the fairs or market stalls.  Her business is important because it's how she maintains herself and her family.  It's how she pays for her children's schooling, for food, and for transportation tickets, and it's how she pays back the loan.  Her favorite part of her business is when her sales are good and she is proud to be able to make the candies her parents make and taught her to make since she was a little girl.  The challenges her business faces are elevated prices and the climate.  When it's cold, it harms the alegr\u00eda, and when it's hot, the candy sweats a lot.  Her family participates in the business.  Her children package the candy and her husband helps her to make it.  Her business encounters competition from the other candy stands, but in the market stalls, everything is there, and people buy from who they want.  She will invest the earnings from the business in merchandise, in food to eat, and in paying back the loan.  Esmeralda is planning to expand her business into other candies, and she plans to do it by managing her profits well.  This business has helped the family a lot in affording food and all the children's school costs.  The improvements she would like to make to her house are fixing the roof and plastering it.  She is very happy with this opportunity she has been given and says thank you for having confidence in us.  She hopes her children will have a profession and live happy and well.  This loan will help her to invest in the candies in order to keep helping her children's education.  The members of the group want to tell Kiva and Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad \"thank you for having confidence in us and we hope you keep helping more people who need it\".\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2175,"image":{"id":714071,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchase of brown sugar, honey, peanuts, amaranth, tamarind, and sugar to make candy","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Amilcingo, Temoac, Morelos","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-02-19T18:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Clara Antonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esmeralda Maribel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosalina Roberta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Imelda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anadeli","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maleni ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-02-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":26000,"loan_amount":2175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1625},{"due_date":"2011-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1625},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1625},{"due_date":"2011-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1625},{"due_date":"2011-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1625},{"due_date":"2011-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1625},{"due_date":"2011-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1625},{"due_date":"2011-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1625},{"due_date":"2011-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1625},{"due_date":"2011-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1625},{"due_date":"2011-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1625},{"due_date":"2011-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1625},{"due_date":"2011-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1625},{"due_date":"2011-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1625},{"due_date":"2011-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1625},{"due_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":1625}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.94},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.94},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.93},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.94},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.94},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.94},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.93},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.94},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.94},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.94},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.93},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.94},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.94},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.94},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.93},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.94}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":271.88,"local_amount":3250,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:45:02Z","rounded_local_amount":3280.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195850173,"comment":null},{"amount":679.68,"local_amount":8125,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:05Z","rounded_local_amount":8201.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201292449,"comment":null},{"amount":543.75,"local_amount":6500,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:09:33Z","rounded_local_amount":6561.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206160707,"comment":null},{"amount":679.69,"local_amount":8125,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:22:30Z","rounded_local_amount":8201.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211233581,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-02-20T02:01:49Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T11:22:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":274592,"name":"Riqchary Wayna Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La socia pertenece al banco comunal  \u201cRIQCHARY WAYNA\u201d; el banco  comunal est\u00e1 ubicado en el distrito de Urubamba,  provincia Urubamba,  departamento del Cusco.\n\nLa socia es la Sra.

","en":"The following group is called \u201cJazm\u00edn\u201d and is located very near to the center of San Felipe del Progreso, about a ten minute walk.  The community where the group meets is called Cabecera.  The community is advanced in that it has all services, paved streets, sports fields, etc.  One can also find everything needed for meals and others because there are many businesses everywhere and people don\u2019t have to go far to get meat, tortillas, water, soft drinks, etc.  The community is populous, there are many houses and it\u2019s somewhat large.\r\n\r\nThe group is made up of 11 women who have their business and struggle to get ahead taking advantage of every opportunity and gleaning as much profit from them as possible.  \r\n\r\nThey called the group \u201cJazm\u00edn\u201d because that\u2019s the name of one of the group members and they meet in her business so they thought it would be a good idea for the group to be named after her.  The names of the members are:\r\n\r\n1.-Florentina P. L.\r\n2.-Margarita L\u00f3pez C.\r\n3.-Maribel C.

They tell us that they\u2019ve known each other since they were little girls and they are responsible.  Also, they help each other out and are very mutually supportive whenever a difficulty arises.  They got together to form a group because the ones who already had businesses wanted to invest more in them and the others wanted to start businesses.  This is how they have stayed together to work hard and get ahead.\r\n\r\nMaribel is the President of this group.  She is 33 years old and has two children, a boy and a girl; both are in elementary school.  Maribel is a single mother and it has been very difficult for her because she does not get any help for her children except from her parents.  However, whatever she makes is for her children. The house she lives in is borrowed from her parents but she tells us that even like that it\u2019s still not easy because her children need a father figure.\r\n\r\nMaribel\u2019s business is selling bed sheets via catalogue.

Located with other art and collectible stores in an antique mall, Christine considers The Vintage Kitty a \u201cconscious boutique\u201d both because of the unique artwork she carries and because she uses her store as a venue to raise awareness for animal rescue.\r\n\r\nChristine offers consignment for people who don\u2019t have a venue to sell their work. Consignment means that she sells their item at her store without actually buying it from them.  They are compensated if the item sells, but if it does not sell, she is not left with inventory she cannot move.  She says consignment has helped keep her costs and inventory low.  She advertises through Facebook and Craigslist, in addition to her own webpage and blog.  If necessary, she will even go door-to-door to ask people if they have things they want to sell.\r\n\r\nAs Christine continues to grow and develop The Vintage Kitty, she looks to further hone its image by carrying more selective work.  Christine says that she is not necessarily interested in carrying \u201cexclusive artwork,\u201d but instead focuses on carrying smart, unique pieces that show creativity.  She does not plan to limit her business contacts to professional artists, but also is interested in talented, amateur artists that create for fun.  \r\n\r\nChristine heard of ACCION Texas-Louisiana through theredshoes.org, an organization that empowers women through personal and spiritual development.  Christine is using this loan to improve the store\u2019s appearance through new displays, and to grow her inventory.    \r\n\r\nChristine strongly believes that with will-power, you can achieve anything.  She was the first person in her family to graduate from high school, and the first to attend and graduate from college.  Christine actively works with the local Baton Rouge animal rescue.  She keeps her store stocked with animal rescue literature, and uses her home as a foster home for rescue cats.\r\n\r\nHer long-term goal is to move The Vintage Kitty to its own location.  Having a stand-alone store would provide her the freedom to better create the image she wants for her business, as well as let her use her store as a center for rescue cats.  The rescue cat center would be separate from her business, and would be maintained and supported by the local animal rescue center.\r\n\r\nCheck out The Vintage Kitty at http:\/\/thevintagekitty.com\/index.htm.  On her website, she also has links to her blog and a link to The Vintage Kitty\u2019s Facebook

Merlinda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past nine loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Merlinda has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 13,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.

is a 36-year-old married woman who supports her family by operating pig fattening and charcoal businesses. She lives in Sagay City, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2002 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her pig fattening and charcoal businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 10,000. Analyn is borrowing PHP 28,000 to fund operations. This will be her 12th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 28,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Analyn aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Angelita has been engaged in her business for over one year and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Angelita joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Angelita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase hog feed and other supplies. Angelita is requesting a new loan of 8000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional piglets to raise. This will be the 5th loan taken out by Angelita from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

With the help of her past five loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Glenda has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 20,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 5,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her sixth loan, she is borrowing PHP 25,000, which she intends to use as additional capital so that she can continue to save up for future expansion of her business.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from preparing and selling cooked food for daily meals. Pacita has been engaged in her business for over 1 year and earns approximately 2,500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Pacita joined Kiva's partner, ASKI, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Pacita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to buy additional products to sell. Pacita is requesting a new loan of 6,000 PHP which will also be used to purchase more products to sell. This loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by Pacita from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling banana products in the local community. Zenaida has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 2,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Zenaida joined Kiva's partner, ASKI, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Zenaida is requesting a new loan of 4,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell at her store. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Zenaida from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from it to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

C. is a 53-year-old married woman who supports her family by operating two business ventures: a general store and a fishing business. She lives in Brooke's Point, Palawan. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2004 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 8,000. Elizabeth is now borrowing PHP 14,000 to purchase more items for resale. This will be her 20th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 14,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Elizabeth aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

This time, for her fourth loan, she is borrowing PHP 11,000, which she intends to use to purchase more stock to sell so that she can continue to save up for future business operation and family needs.

She earns her living buying and selling fresh\/dried fish. Her husband Julius, who is 33 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living. They have two children who are 8 and 9 years old. Rowena joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2009 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past six loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Rowena has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 23,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her seventh loan, she is borrowing PHP 28,000, which she intends to use to purchase more stock to continue to save up for future expansion of her business and to send her children to school. Rowena is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

She earns her living by operating three business ventures: soft drinks, livestock and a general store. Her husband Alejandro, who is 53 years old, works as a laborer to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have five children who are 8 to 26 years old. Sergia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2006 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past seven loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Sergia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 11,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 13,400, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her eighth loan, she is borrowing PHP 16,000, which she intends to use to buy soft drinks. She also has an inventory of livestock so that she can continue to save up for future education and renovation of her house. Sergia C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

She earns her living by operating three business ventures:  a general store, hog raising and motorcycle transport. Her husband Osias, who is 42 years old, works as a laborer to earn his living. They have three children who are between 7 and 16 years old. Josefina joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 10 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Josefina has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 14,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4,800, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 11th loan, she is borrowing PHP 17,000, which she intends to use to buy stock for the general store so that she can continue to save up for her children's future education. Josefina is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

H\u1ec7  is the group leader of a 6-member group loan offered by SEDA.  While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.  The official name of this borrowing group is \u0110\u1ed3ng Th\u00f4n 2 (Nh\u00f3m 10).\r\n\r\n\r\nH\u1ec7  is married and has 3 school-aged children.  To making a living, H\u1ec7  owns and operates a business venture in the food sector running a food stall.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling seafood products such as fish and shrimp in the local community.  H\u1ec7  has been engaged in this business for over 3 years and earns approximately 5.000.000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2009, H\u1ec7  joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  H\u1ec7  has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5.152.000 VND from SEDA.  This previous loan was used to purchase new items to expand product offering.  She is now requesting a new loan of 5.152.000 VND which will be used to purchase additional inventory and working capital.  The loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by the borrower from SEDA.  H\u1ec7  plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of the borrower's family.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the Other Borrowers in the Group:\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

This time, for her ninth loan, she is borrowing PHP 24,000, which she intends to use to buy stock for her general store so that she can continue to save up for the future education of children.

C. is a 28-year-old married woman who supports her family by operating three business ventures: motorcycle transport, meat vending and a computer games business. She lives in Samboan, Cebu. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2003 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her motorcycle transport, meat vending and computer games businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 3,500. Jennifer is now borrowing PHP 15,500 to fund operations. This will be her 10th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Jennifer aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

is a 57-year-old married woman who supports her family by operating a furniture business. She lives in Pontevedra, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2000 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her furniture business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 12,000. Evelyn is borrowing PHP 25,000 to fund operations. This will be her 18th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 25,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Evelyn aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

is a 38 year old freight driver. He has been doing this job for almost 12 years. He bought a second-hand car to be operated as a freight car. Bambang is married and has 5 children. They are: \r\n-\tTia, 14 years old who is in the 2nd grade of Junior high school; \r\n-\tRivai, 12 years old who is in the 1st grade of Junior high school; \r\n-\tBima, 9 years old who is in the 3rd grade of elementary school; \r\n-\tTrisha, 4 years old; and \r\n-\tPanca, 1 and a half year old. \r\nBambang and his family live in Pasir Panjang Village.\r\n\r\nBambang usually looks for customers in Kupang City. He usually parks his car in front of a basic foods shop in Kupang and waits for the customers who need his service to deliver the goods that they bought. His income as a driver is unstable and depends on how many customerst he gets within a day. He can generate about IDR 75,000 to 250,000 in a day. But there are also times when he has to return home without any income. Moreover, his car often has problems so he has to stop working for a few days just to fix the car. There are some spare parts of the car that have to be replaced, but because the price is expensive, Bambang cannot afford it. He replaced the spare parts with cheaper ones, but the repair did not last for long. For this reason, Bambang is requesting a loan amounting to IDR 4,500,000 from TLM. He really hopes to get the loan so he can buy the new spare parts for his car.

She also believes that these days the woman must help her husband with their income, since everything is so expensive these days.

is a married woman who lives in Daanbantayan, Cebu. She earns her living buying and selling dry goods.  Her husband Elmer, who is 35 years old, works as a vendor to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have five children who are 7 to 17 years old. Roxanne joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past six loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Roxanne has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 7,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 7th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000, which she intends to use to pay for more stocks for her business so that she can continue to save up for future education and expansion of her business. Roxanne is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

She lives in Danao City, Cebu. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2010 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 6,800. Algrace is borrowing PHP 10,000 so that she can continue to fund the operations of her business. This will be her third loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 7,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Algrace aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  a sari-sari (general) store and a sugarcane field. Her husband Celso, who is 65 years old, works as a laborer to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities. They have 10 children who are between between 18 and 42 years old. Amparo joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1993 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 19 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Amparo has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 1,300, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 20th loan, she is borrowing PHP 17,000, which she intends to use as funds for business operations so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Amparo is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The stability of her business allows her to make a considerable contribution to her family\u2019s income. Today Mavjuda requests $2000 which she is going to use to purchase more new wedding dresses. Mavjuda has earned a reputation for taking responsibility for her financial obligations and for keeping her word. We are happy to have another opportunity to assist her with the operation of her business.\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International:<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history which includes its place as a key post along the Silk Road and events at the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n \r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n \r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n \r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

In the future, she hopes to hire somebody to help her serve her customers.\r\n\r\nThis is Isabel's first loan with MFP and she feels that she must make all her repayments punctually.

It is composed of five women who are neighbors and who know each other.  They are:  Joaquina God\u00ednez Rodr\u00edguez who will use her loan to buy corn, plates, brown paper, napkins, pork skin and oil to stock her business; Manuela M. Hern\u00e1ndez who will use the loan to buy cold cuts, Maruchan soups, mayonnaise and chilies in vinegar to stock her business; Mariana Z. Hern\u00e1ndez who will use her loan to buy meat, plates, drinking glasses and a griddle to stock her business; Maricela M. G. who will buy milk, rennet, fruit for her yoghurt and glasses to stock her business and Aurelia C. V. who will buy plates, corn, meat, oil and charcoal to stock her pozole and tostada sales business.\r\n\r\nMrs. Mariana Z. Hern\u00e1ndez is the group representative.  She is 29 years old and finished 6th grade.  She\u2019s married and her husband works as a bricklayer.  They have three children: Alondra, 8, who is in elementary school, Paloma, 3, and Joaqu\u00edn, 13, who doesn\u2019t go to school anymore and goes to help his father working as a bricklayer\u2019s assistant.\r\n\r\nShe has a business selling suadero (thin cut of beef from the brisket) taquitos, longaniza and meat with chili at the local elementary school in the afternoons.  She asked for a loan to buy meat, oil, vegetables, tortillas, plates and spoons.  She started the business five years ago.  She learned by watching how the taquitos were prepared.  She used to sell tostadas and rice tacos and later was offered the opportunity to sell the taquitos.  A teacher told her that if she wanted to sell them she could and she accepted.\r\n\r\nShe started out using money she had from the bedspreads and invested it in food to prepare the taquitos.  She also sells shoes, bedspreads and underwear via catalogue.  She goes out daily to offer her wares to neighbors and relatives in her free time.  Her business is a block from home; she walks to the elementary school to sell the taquitos.\r\n\r\nHer business is important because it produces money for her children as well as food to eat.  Her favorite part of the job is tending to the customers and she feels happy when she sees how much her customers, who are the children and teachers, like the taquitos that she prepares so gladly.  Her business is very popular because it\u2019s very well known by the children because of the good flavor of the taquitos.  She uses profits from the business to reinvest in the food to continue selling, to repay the loan, for her children, for school.  She wants to buy a charcoal grill and a griddle to provide better service to her customers and intends to do so thanks to the loan.\r\n\r\nShe likes Ciudad Ayala because it\u2019s very pretty, has a nice ambience and there are many passersby in the streets.  There are two spas: Axocoche and El Colibr\u00ed.  There are springs here and streams where the water from the springs runs.  Christmas is celebrated in grand scale.  There are Nativity masses at 6 and 8 at night.  After mass people return home to lull the Baby Jesus; they sing to him and lull him.  They hand out little buckets, gourds and little baskets with treats.\r\n\r\nHer business has helped the family get ahead with the children.  The improvements she wants to make to her house are to rebuild it from top to bottom and fix it up nicely.  Her plans and hopes for the future of her children are to get ahead and provide an education for them and to have a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nMariana is happy with the loan she\u2019s getting because it\u2019s an opportunity she\u2019s going to invest in her business and it will help her much.  \r\n\r\nThe improvement she hopes for her children is that they study and improve and she feels they will accomplish this with the loan\u2019s help because she will invest it in her business and from it will be taking out a little to continue to buy and for her children.\r\n\r\nThe group members would like to say to Kiva and Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad: thank you thinking of us because thanks to you we get ahead in our businesses.  Thank you for granting the loan.  It is appreciated because you lend to us at low interest because you are always concerned for us.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":714981,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy meat, oil, tortillas, vegetables, plates and spoons to stock her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Ayala, Morelos","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-02-19T21:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":925,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joaquina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Manuela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maricela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aurelia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-02-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":11000,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":687.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":687.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":687.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":687.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":687.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":687.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":687.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":687.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":687.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":687.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":687.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":687.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":687.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":687.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":687.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":687.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.81},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.82},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.81},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.81},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.81},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.82},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.81},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.81},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.81},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.82},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.81},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.81},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.81},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.82},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.81},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.81}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":115.63,"local_amount":1375,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:44:38Z","rounded_local_amount":1389.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195850175,"comment":null},{"amount":289.06,"local_amount":3437.5,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:23Z","rounded_local_amount":3472.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201292451,"comment":null},{"amount":231.25,"local_amount":2750,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:08:58Z","rounded_local_amount":2778.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206160709,"comment":null},{"amount":289.06,"local_amount":3437.5,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:22:49Z","rounded_local_amount":3472.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211233583,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-02-20T02:18:25Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T11:22:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":274842,"name":"Virgen De Juquila Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Este grupo solidario se llama Virgen de Juquila, se encuentra localizado en barrio San Miguel Cohuecan, estado de Puebla, M\u00e9xico, esta integra por 7 mujeres trabajadoras que se conocen y son vecinas ellas son la se\u00f1ora Ernestina R.

It is made up of 7 hard-working women who know each other and are neighbors.  They are Ernestina R. Ram\u00edrez, who will use her loan to buy clay and white clay to make pitchers that she sells unfired; Petra Constantina V. M., who will buy clay to make pitchers; Luisa S. Gonz\u00e1lez, who will buy firewood, clay and white clay for making pots and casserole dishes; Maura A. V., who will buy clay to make rustic pitchers; Diana Mart\u00ednez L\u00f3pez, who will buy medicines, anti-inflamatories, syrups and analgesics to stock her pharmacy; Manuela S. S., who will buy clay and firewood to make pedestals and Gabina R. A., who will buy clay and white clay to make casserole dishes.\r\n\r\nLuisa S. Gonz\u00e1lez is a member of the group.  She is 36 years old and studied up to the 6th year of elementary school, obtaining her leaver's certificate.  She is single and lives with her mom and brother.  They work as potters, making pitchers, casserole dishes and pots.  Luisa is requesting her loan to buy firewood, clay and white clay to stock her business with supplies so that she has the material she needs to make her pitchers, casserole dishes and pots.  She started in her business 28 years ago, watching how her mom cut the clay, and she learned all on her own.  It is a family business and all her family work in it.  It is located in her home and is very important because she supports herself with it.\r\n\r\nLuisa enjoys being a potter, making casserole dishes and painting them.  She is proud because she works, bakes her products and everything comes out beautifully.  It has also helped her to take a stewardship role in her community.  There are 8 days of fiesta each year when they feed everybody and provide the church with floral arrangements and candles.  Luisa's customers are from Jaloxtoc, Ahuatlan and Tepetlixpa.  Her business is popular because of the good work that she does and the finishing touches that she makes to the pitchers, casserole dishes and pots.  The challenge that she faces in her business is the climate.  When it rains, the clay doesn't dry and she can't work.  Her business also faces competition because the whole village makes pottery items.  Luisa re-invests the profits that she makes back into her business, uses some to survive on, some to eat and some to repay her loan.  She is planning to stock her business with more material so that she can have some stored up.  She plans to continue working together with her mom and brother who will also help her to repay the loan.  This business has helped her family a lot.  It has provided them with the food they need and helped them to live more comfortably.\r\n\r\nThe improvement that Luisa would like to make to her home is to plaster it.  Her plans and hopes for the future are to continue working and for everyone to enjoy good health.  She is very happy to be receiving this loan because she will have money to buy the material she needs.\r\n\r\nSan Bartolo Cohuecan is a quiet village.  From it you can see the Popocatapetl and Iztaccihuatl volcanoes.  In the month of December, the Popocatapetl volcano turns red and they sow sorghum, corn, peanuts and onions.  Starting August 24th, they celebrate an 8-day-long fiesta dedicated to the patron saint San Bartolo (Saint Bartholomew).  They provide everybody in the village, and visitors, with food, there is music, bullfighting, fireworks, engagements and Aztec dances. \r\n\r\nThe members of this group would like to say to Kiva and Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad, \"Many thanks for these loans that you give us.  We hope that you will lend to us at lower interest rates because the situation is difficult and let's hope the interest rates don't go up so that we have more money for our materials\"."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2600,"image":{"id":715079,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":"To buy firewood, clay, white clay for making pitchers, pans and casserole dishes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"BARRIO SAN MIGUEL, COHUECAN","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-02-19T22:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ernestina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Petra Constantina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Diana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Manuela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gabina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-02-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":31000,"loan_amount":2600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":3591.75},{"due_date":"2011-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":3669.24},{"due_date":"2011-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":3748.41},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3829.28},{"due_date":"2011-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":3911.9},{"due_date":"2011-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":3996.3},{"due_date":"2011-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":4082.52},{"due_date":"2011-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":4170.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":301.24},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":307.75},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":314.38},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":321.16},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":328.1},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":335.17},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":342.41},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":349.79}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":301.24,"local_amount":3591.75,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:44:43Z","rounded_local_amount":3618.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195850176,"comment":null},{"amount":622.13,"local_amount":7417.65,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:36Z","rounded_local_amount":7473.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201292452,"comment":null},{"amount":984.43,"local_amount":11737.48,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:09:05Z","rounded_local_amount":11826.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206160710,"comment":null},{"amount":692.2,"local_amount":8253.12,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:21:55Z","rounded_local_amount":8315.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211233584,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-02-20T07:11:48Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T11:21:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":274843,"name":"Rosalia De Los Angeles","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Rosalia de 21 a\u00f1os, es una mujer trabajadora que tiene muchas aspiraciones para su familia.

Suddenly, she was unsure of what she could do for a living in her new home. \u201cThere are so many opportunities in this country, but not knowing English was a huge barrier. Where could I work if I didn\u2019t speak the language?\u201d \n \nEager to continue working with children, Libia began volunteering with preschool and afterschool programs in San Francisco as a childcare provider and Spanish teacher. A coworker, noticing Libia\u2019s expertise, soon suggested she open her own in-home childcare business. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know such a thing existed!\u201d, Libia recalled. \n \nLibia\u2019s in-home childcare center, called \"Nest Garden Heart\", has now been in business for nearly 15 years and Libia is a pillar in her community. \u201cIt is amazing to work with children and to be able to watch them grow,\u201d says Libia. \u201cMany of them first come to my home when they\u2019re as young as 2 months old, and stay until they are ready to go to preschool. I\u2019m there as they take their first steps and get their first teeth.\u201d \n \nNest Garden Heart offers a wide variety of activities and resources to help the children learn and grow, including areas dedicated to reading, music, theater and costumes, and art. This encouraging educational environment is particularly important given that many of the children in her care are special needs or at-risk youth who come to Nest Garden Heart via San Francisco family service agencies. Libia also offers overnight childcare to parents who work the night-shift and need a safe space to leave their children.  \n \nSince Libia received her first loan from Opportunity Fund in 2006, she has used two microloans to renovate her backyard and set up a garden and play space. Now, with a loan Libia will be able to purchase new equipment and furniture designed for special needs children, replace worn-out and missing educational supplies, and ensure that her small business continues to be a success.\n\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":6200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2957.96,"image":{"id":714110,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Child

Now, six years later, she says that defying those predictions is one her proudest accomplishments. \u201cEveryone told me I wouldn\u2019t be able to do it\u2013 but look!

Iliana and her husband founded the business with their own savings and, by sticking to a tight budget, successfully expanded from mobile flower sales in a parking lot to operating their own shop. \u201cWe are growing and earning more money, but it can be difficult each month to pay for our house, or business, and our normal expenses,\u201d explains Iliana. \u201cWe didn\u2019t even know that a loan was an option for a tiny business like ours.

This loan will also help her begin to establish a credit history and give her the option to seek larger business loans in the future. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":715637,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To increase inventory of flowers and gifts for Valentine's Day","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"US","country":"United States","town":"Richmond, CA","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39.76 -98.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":132,"posted_date":"2011-02-23T22:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Iliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":81.72},{"due_date":"2011-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":83.14},{"due_date":"2011-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":83.63},{"due_date":"2011-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":84.24},{"due_date":"2011-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":84.77}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.72},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.14},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.63},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.24},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.77}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":81.72,"local_amount":81.72,"processed_date":"2011-03-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-21T08:15:16Z","rounded_local_amount":81.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201339482,"comment":null},{"amount":82.5,"local_amount":82.5,"processed_date":"2011-04-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:38:38Z","rounded_local_amount":82.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206209512,"comment":null},{"amount":83.14,"local_amount":83.14,"processed_date":"2011-05-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-29T07:57:37Z","rounded_local_amount":83.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211284825,"comment":null},{"amount":83.63,"local_amount":83.63,"processed_date":"2011-06-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-22T07:59:38Z","rounded_local_amount":83.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":217381937,"comment":null},{"amount":84.24,"local_amount":84.24,"processed_date":"2011-07-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-18T07:52:15Z","rounded_local_amount":84.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221734787,"comment":null},{"amount":84.77,"local_amount":84.77,"processed_date":"2011-08-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-27T08:21:07Z","rounded_local_amount":84.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227105067,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-02-24T00:53:36Z","paid_date":"2011-09-27T08:21:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":274925,"name":"Esther Maria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Esther de 26 a\u00f1os, es una mujer trabajadora que est\u00e1 trabajando con esfuerzo y dedicaci\u00f3n para sus hijos de 12 y 5 a\u00f1os ya que esta actualmente separada. \n\nElla tiene una peque\u00f1a tienda en la parte delantera de su casa en donde vende arroz, az\u00facar, l\u00e1cteos y otros productos.

She earns her living by buying and selling fruits & vegetables.  Her husband Conrado, who is 59 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have six children who are 12 to 37 years old. Carmelita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 13 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Carmelita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 14,000, which she added to her working capital, helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 14th loan, she is borrowing PHP 20,000, which she intends to use to buy more fruits and vegetables to resell so that she can continue to save up for the higher education of her children and expansion of her business. Carmelita is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

is a 49-year-old married who supports her family by operating two business ventures:  buying and selling Ready-to-Wear (RTW) clothes and buying and selling bananas. She lives in Toboso, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 1995 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly net income of PHP 1,200. Susana is borrowing PHP 14,000 to purchase more stocks to sell. This will be her 21st loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 12,000, which she paid off well within its term was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Susana aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She lives in Sta. Catalina, Negros Oriental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2002 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 5,000. Felisa is borrowing PHP 15,000 to purchase more stocks to sell. This will be her 18th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Felisa aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Catalina, Negros Oriental. She earns her living by operating a sari sari (general) store. Her husband Rodrigo, who is 41 years old, works as a carpenter to earn his living. They have three children who are 10 to 21 years old. Susan joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 10 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Susan has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 7,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 11th loan, she is borrowing PHP 20,000, which she intends to use to purchase more stock to sell so that she can continue to save up for the college education of her children and house renovation. Susan is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

She earns her living by venturing into several businesses: running a general store, buying and selling rice and charcoal. Her husband Pablo, who is 62 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities. They have three children who are 13 to 26 years old. Gloria joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1994 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 20 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Gloria has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 20,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 5,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 21st loan, she is borrowing PHP 20,000 to fund her business operations so that she can continue to save up for the college education of her children. It is Gloria's dream that her children graduate from college.  Gloria is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nLorna operates a variety store where she also does a little direct selling of cosmetics, clothing and footwear. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 PHP worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Arlene earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of $9.50 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, she is requesting a 20,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nLorna hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she hopes to be able to help her neighbors and community through her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nRiza operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 PHP worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Arlene earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her home. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of about $10 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 10,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMa. Riza hopes to be able to expand soon. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":715861,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to expand her product inventory","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Caloocan City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-02-19T14:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ma.

She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  a general store and an abaca weaving businesses. Her husband Joelito, who is 45 years old, works as a laborer to earn his living.  They have three children who are 10 to 23 years old. Pilarina joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2009 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past two loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Pilarina has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 7,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 7,200,  uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her third loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000 to buy stocks of products for her general store so that she can continue to save up for future expansion of her business. Pilarina is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n<br>Anna Liza operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which sells groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to members of the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy a sachet of shampoo, 5 PHP-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Arlene earns a living by purchasing supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and other members of the local community. She earns a minimum of 400 PHP in sales every day.\r\n<br>To help her continue to operate her business, she is requesting a 10,000 PHP loan. She will be using the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. Anna Liza hopes to be able to expand soon. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n<p>\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Her youngest son stays at home; he is just 10 years old.\r\n \r\nKhursheed is part of this group loan from Kiva partner Asasah. She has applied for a loan for her husband\u2019s business. With the loan, he will buy goats and sell them at a good profit.\r\n   \r\nKhursheed is hopeful that this investment will be productive for her husband and make him better profits in the future.\r\n  \r\nShe is a regular loan user of Asasah and this is her fourth loan application. In previous loan years, she has maintained a good credit behavior and never missed any meeting.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":715919,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy goats for the animal sales business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PK","country":"Pakistan","town":"Mian Channu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"30.45 72.366667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":60,"posted_date":"2011-02-19T14:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Khursheed ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bashiran","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Samina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-02-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PKR","disbursal_amount":52000,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":4768},{"due_date":"2011-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4768},{"due_date":"2011-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4768},{"due_date":"2011-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":4768},{"due_date":"2011-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":4768},{"due_date":"2011-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":4768},{"due_date":"2011-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":4768},{"due_date":"2011-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":4768},{"due_date":"2011-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":4768},{"due_date":"2011-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":4768},{"due_date":"2012-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":4320}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.31},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.31},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.3},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.31},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.31},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.31},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.3},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.31},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.31},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.31},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":57.31,"local_amount":4768,"processed_date":"2011-03-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:15:12Z","rounded_local_amount":4890.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201233024,"comment":null},{"amount":57.31,"local_amount":4768,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:13:28Z","rounded_local_amount":4890.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206099429,"comment":null},{"amount":57.3,"local_amount":4768,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:34:50Z","rounded_local_amount":4890.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211169832,"comment":null},{"amount":57.31,"local_amount":4768,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:34:46Z","rounded_local_amount":4890.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216452575,"comment":null},{"amount":57.31,"local_amount":4768,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:17:21Z","rounded_local_amount":4890.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221616530,"comment":null},{"amount":57.31,"local_amount":4768,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:28:25Z","rounded_local_amount":4890.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":226985659,"comment":null},{"amount":57.3,"local_amount":4768,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:22:53Z","rounded_local_amount":4890.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232744504,"comment":null},{"amount":57.31,"local_amount":4768,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:25:24Z","rounded_local_amount":4890.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238548989,"comment":null},{"amount":57.31,"local_amount":4768,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:16:10Z","rounded_local_amount":4890.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244507786,"comment":null},{"amount":57.31,"local_amount":4768,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:22:45Z","rounded_local_amount":4890.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250715462,"comment":null},{"amount":51.92,"local_amount":4320,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:34:12Z","rounded_local_amount":4430.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257118364,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-02-20T01:08:16Z","paid_date":"2012-02-15T09:34:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":274987,"name":"Sakina's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sakina is a member of this group loan.

That truck will allow them to transport fruits and vegetables from villages to their business place.\r\n  \r\nAnush asks for an 800,000 AMD loan to buy a new sewing machine and other necessary equipment for her sewing business and to fill in the missing amount of money for truck buying.
