Habib is a diligent and tenacious farmer, who strives to meet his family\u2019s needs. His wife does not work and thus, he carries the financial burden alone, through his farming income, to meet his family\u2019s needs. Habib works on a 1-hectare farm owned by his parents. His harvests are sometimes not maximized because his cultivation method and seeds are not the best. Better farming supplies, seeds and fertilizer require a larger capital, which he lacks. \r\n\r\nHabib is now relieved that IMON International is helping him to get the loan that he needs to improve his farming. This loan will be used to buy superior seeds, organic fertilizers and pesticides. Habib is waiting for his next harvest, which he hopes will yield better results than his previous harvests. He will use his farming income to support his children\u2019s educational needs. If there is still some money left, he really hopes to fix his unfinished house.      \r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi.  The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Carmelita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to invest in expanding the business. Carmelita is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the 12th loan taken out by Carmelita from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

face of financial hardships in her alcohol brewing and sales business in Mpiriggwa-Mityana. It is not such a lucrative business, as manifested by the 10,000 Kenyan shillings she gets weekly, but nonetheless, Joyce remains upbeat about her future prospects. With earnings from this business she has been able to provide meals and other necessities, though minimally, to her family. She reckons this loan will give her business a new lease of growth.

She is 39 years old and has a sixth-grade education. She is single and has three children: Sheila, 17, who is in baccalaureate studies; Roberto, 12, who is in middle school; Diana, 5, who is in kindergarten. Ang\u00e9lica has a business selling Mexican food, and with the loan she plans to purchase refreshments, grocery items, ingredients, vegetables and desserts for her business. She also plans to service her car and buy some parts and fix some damage to it. Her business is called Cafeter\u00eda Ang\u00e9lica. She offers typical regional dishes to customers such as tortas and tacos, as well as sweets, coffee and refreshments. She started her business 10 years old, getting permission to sell food in Normal Rural school in Amilcingo. She learned by watching how they prepared the food, and with her first loan she purchased supplies, a grill and a griddle. Her business still is in the school, which takes her about 15 minutes to travel to. Her business is important because it provides her with everything she needs to take care of her children, and it's a job she values a lot. She thanks God for the job, and she likes everything about it. She is very proud of her business because it is hers and she doesn't depend on anyone. Her customers are the students and the teachers, and she tends to about 100 customers. Her business is popular because of her good customer service. The challenges she faces is that during the rainy season her sales drop, and there is competition in front of the school where other businesses sell food. She uses the profits to provide for her children and cover her expenses. Her daughter Sheila helps with the business in the afternoons, tending to customers and preparing meals at home for another day. Amilcingo is a small but pretty town where they produce candies, peanut butter, tamarind and other items as well as harvest peanuts, corn and amaranth. Ang\u00e9lica's business has helped her family financially, providing food and covering all their school fees. She would like to make improvements to her home, installing new doors and glass windows, and adding a water tank. Her hope for the future is for her children to continue their studies and earn degrees. She plans to use the loan so her business earns more revenue. Ang\u00e9lica is very pleased with this loan and is going to use it to keep working selling food.

P. is a young man of 24 years of age. He is single, and he works in a mechanics shop that he founded some years ago. He finished his high school education, but did not continue his studies due to his complete dedication to his work.\r\nHe is requesting a loan to buy tools and accessories for his work. With this loan, he will buy: four way wrenches, tongs, motor grease, lubricants, filters, antifreeze, brake fluid, pistons, and spark plugs. Things are going well for Irineo and his shop, but he does not own the premises. So far, he has been able to pay the rent on time and also pays his assistant on time.

","en":"Juan is 20 years old, single and works in automotive repair and general mechanics. He and his brother work in the same shop. He left high school after his second year, choosing to work full time, which he has done for 5 years.  Juan is a very upstanding young man who is full of life. He enjoys his work and he approaches each day enthusiastically. He is passionate about fixing cars.\r\n\r\nAs far as income, he feels like he can't complain given that he and his brother share expenses associated with the rent and maintenance of their shop.   Juan sees the need to improve in his business by purchasing tools he lacks as well as other additional materials. The money from this loan will be put towards buying pliers, wrenches, various kinds of motor oil, filters, spark plugs, pistons, brake fluid, and antifreeze, among other items. Juan invested all of his capital specifically in improving the service provided in his business. At the shop, they do very good work which is why their clients come to them and know him and his brother very well, not to mention their father who also works in the automotive business, selling tires for all kinds of cars and trucks.   \r\n\r\nJuan tells us is that the greatest challenge he faces is himself, in striving to improve each day, continuing to learn and retaining his customers. He sees each day as another opportunity to improve and promote his business.   He has never lacked for work and for that reason he has recently been in the process of growing his business. Juan wishes to have his own garage, with the necessary and appropriate equipment to facilitate their work. He wants for other young people, like him, to learn this trade, instead of taking the easy rode of alcohol, thefts and drugs. He is willing to help other young people by teaching them so that they can become self-sufficient and offer assistance to their families to improve their lives.   \r\n\r\nOne of his hopes is that God will grant him health and more life so that he can one day own his own garage. With that gift, aside from just fixing cars, he could offer employment to other people. He would also like to have his own house and in the future have his own family, but not without having something to offer them.   He is grateful to those who are instrumental in providing his loan. Thanks to all for your support and trust and may you continue supporting those who need it most.

Each day, Mari strives to keep her store stocked with basic goods as well as products that are in high demand. \r\n\r\nOver time, not only have their children grown, but so has their need for an education, clothing, shoes etc.  Her husband decided to go to the United States when the income from the store no longer was sufficient to meet their family's needs.\u2028  Mari's needs prompted her to request a loan to be put towards her business. With the loan, she was able to buy rice, beans, eggs, oil, milk, canned chili peppers, salt, cookies, some soft drinks and bottled juice. She has related to us that with this assistance her business is improving and she is able to offer more products to her clients. The money she earns goes toward loan payments, reinvestments and purchasing necessary items. \r\n\r\nThe challenge Maria is facing is with competing stores.  It can be difficult at times to maintain her business due to the raise in the price of commodities as well as the increasing number of near by businesses.  The advantage Maria has is that she does not have to pay rent because her business is located in her home.  However, what is not in her favor is the limited space she has for her products because of the small size of the room where the store is located.  \r\n\r\nMaria indicates that in spite of everything her business is doing well and she hopes to make it grow more. She would like to increase the size of the space where her store is located in order to stock it with more products. She would also like to improve her housing and see her children study in a career track. Maria is grateful to Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad for the loan. Receiving it and learning how to invest it have been a great help. Maria wishes the best to all those who have made the assistance possible."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":685875,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"The loan request described below is to purchase food products and staple goods such as; rice, beans, soup ingredients, milk, sugar, canned chili peppers, canned beans, canned sardines and tuna, salt, eggs, laundry detergent, body soap etc. ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-01-14T02:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Estela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-01-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":9000,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":562.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":187.5,"local_amount":2250,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:44:16Z","rounded_local_amount":2273.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191430836,"comment":null},{"amount":187.5,"local_amount":2250,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:44:58Z","rounded_local_amount":2273.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195850089,"comment":null},{"amount":187.5,"local_amount":2250,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:43Z","rounded_local_amount":2273.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201292363,"comment":null},{"amount":187.5,"local_amount":2250,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:09:10Z","rounded_local_amount":2273.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206160621,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-01-14T11:24:22Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T11:09:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":264691,"name":"Laura Georgina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Se\u00f1ora Laura P. es socia del banco comunal Las Cumplidas, vive por la parroquia de San Joaqu\u00edn siendo este sector el mayor productor de hortalizas ya que su gente se dedica a la agricultura y cr\u00eda de animales. \n\nNuestra socia tiene 46 a\u00f1os, es viuda hace 12 a\u00f1os y tiene 5 hijos de 27, 25, 23, 16 y 15 a\u00f1os de edad, su segunda hija es casada y vive independiente, su primera hija  estudia en la universidad, su tercera hija a egresado de la universidad, sus dos \u00faltimos hijos estudian en un colegio de la ciudad.

G. is 74 years old and her husband is the same age as her. They had 9 children, of whom 8 are living and 1 has passed away. Despite her age she still sells fruits and vegetables. She has installed a small stand in her home and whatever profits she makes in her  business she reinvests them in the purchase of more merchandise and to provide for some of her  husband's needs. Carmen is a very hardworking person and despite her advanced age and her diabetes she's never without an occupation to earn an income. Carmen has enjoyed being independent of her children by having her own money for whatever emergency comes up. She does not depend at all on her children. They each have their own obligations, family, and dependents to take care of. \r\n\r\nCarmen requested a loan to supplement her working capital, to invest in her small business. She is confident she will be able to repay the loan. This loan was used to purchase: bananas, oranges, mandarin oranges, apples, peaches, pineapples, watermelons, cantaloupes, tomatoes, chilli peppers, onions, garlic, romaine lettuce, potatoes, carrots, chayotes, and zucchini. \r\n\r\nCarmen's wish is to have no further complications in her health. Diabetes is a disease that requires much attention and a somewhat complicated treatment. She hopes not to have a health crisis, but she also wants to prosper with her business. She wants to see steady sales and to never fail to have enthusiasm and wish to work.\r\n\r\nHer hope is kept up when she is able to see her great grand children. Her husband is in good health. She hopes to not have to suffer and to one day pass away without pain. She says that she is not upset about the hour of her passing. \r\n\r\nShe is grateful to all of those around the world who have taken the time to read about her life.  To all those individuals who feel sad or depressed, she wishes them to look up on her life as an example of how beautiful it is to reach her age. Life is a little box full of surprises, but one has to be ready for all those things that are in store for us. Thanks to Kiva and Fundacion Realidad (Kiva Field Partner).

","en":"This group is called \u201cFlor de Primavera\u201d (Flower of Spring), which is located in the community of Calvario del Carmen, San Felipe del Progreso.  Its membership consists of nine women, all of whom are <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mazahua\" target=\"_blank\" >Mazahuas<\/a>.  These nine women know how to embroider, sew, and knit.  They make napkins, tablecloths, vests, and other items.  Some of the women sell their embroideries to earn some extra money, but they all raise livestock and want to use this loan to buy chickens, turkeys, and sheep to raise.  This is generally a poor community.  All of the residents work in the fields and take care of animals.  The men work as masons and must leave town and travel to the city to work on construction jobs.  After finishing their work, they return to town so that they can care for their animals and their crops.\r\n<p>\r\nThe names of the women are as follows:\r\n1.\tMaria Felipa R. V., age 67, knows embroidery and raises sheep.\r\n2.\tAngelina Gonzalez M., age 33, has a grocery store and raises animals.\r\n3.\tZeferina C. Lopes, age 37, raises animals, chickens, and turkeys.\r\n4.\tAmalia M. C., age 25, raises sheep and manages a general store in her home.\r\n5.\tCatalina C.

M., age 38, raises chickens and is the group leader.\r\n<p>\r\nDo\u00f1a Margarita says the nine members were excited to form a group because they have known each other since childhood and have been neighbors all of their lives.  For this reason, they are confident that they can move forward as a group and trust one another.  The group members conduct themselves well and get along with each other.  This group is called \u201cFlor de Primavera\u201d because it was formed during the spring and the name seemed to be a good idea.  \r\n<p>\r\nDo\u00f1a Margarita will start raising chickens and turkeys because these animals sell well throughout the year.  She has experience raising these animals, but she lacks the money to buy them.  With this loan, she now plans to buy new animals to raise because at first she had difficulty raising chickens and turkeys because they got sick.  She will immediately buy vaccines to prevent them from dying because if one animal gets sick they all become infected.  \r\n<p>\r\nDo\u00f1a Margarita says the loan will benefit her family because she has children in school.  She has one child who is 10 years old and attends elementary school while another one started preschool.  Her other two children are older and work, for a total of four children.  Do\u00f1a Margarita wants to buy her children clothes and school supplies.  She and her husband are not formally married, but they live in their own home.  Do\u00f1a Margarita\u2019s husband works as a mason and they must live off of what little he earns.  Her goals include moving forward with her animal business.  Not only does she want to raise chickens, but she also will use her loan and some of her profits to buy sheep and cows.  These funds will help her acquire a pair of sheep, so she will her next loan to buy a few cows.

","en":"The following group is called \"El Carmen\" and it is located in the community of Carmen Ocotepec.  The community is very religious and it should be mentioned that the town is mostly made up of women. The men of the community go to the United States to work for the sake of their family\u2019s quality of life. The men who send money will come back to their village when they have enough to build a house and to start a life back home.  The women raise livestock animals and with the funds that their husbands send them, they are able to keep the children in school and they can start building a house for when the men return.\r\n\r\nThe members of the group are hardworking women who enjoy success and work hard to help their husbands with the family, striving to give better opportunities to the children. The names of the members are the following: \r\n\r\n1. Argelia Ivonne C. M. raises chickens and turkeys. \r\n2. Nancy B. G. has a convenience store. \r\n3. Joaquina C. F. raises sheep. \r\n4. Rosa Sanchez C. raises sheep. \r\n5. Rafaela R. S. raises chickens. \r\n6. Marcelina C. F. has a convenience store.\r\n7. Gregorio Sanchez C. is a taxi driver. \r\n8. Natividad Esmeralda O. E. raises chickens and turkeys.\r\n\r\nThis group decided on that name because the name of the community is El Carmen Ocotopec, to  underline that they are from that community. The representative for the group comments that the members know each other now but they didn't prior to the organization of the group. Some are neighbours and others come from far, even though they are from the same community. It was a bit unusual how they all come together as a group.\r\n\r\nThe representative of the group is Maria Joaquina C. F.. Joaquina lives with her common-law husband and they have four children together, 3 girls and 1 boy. Her husband is a taxi driver, working from the very early morning until sunset. The kids go to school. Two are in primary school and 1 is in high school. The other child has not reached school age yet. Joaquina and her family live in a house that has been lent out to them by her mother-in-law. She dreams of building her own home, but their situation is not easy. She also needs to work to help her husband, and as she has children in her care she doesn't have time to work. Joaquina decided to raise sheep for later resale, with the goal of earning an extra income for the family. She has some sheep already but she wants to increase her flock. Joaquina doesn't find it difficult to raise them. She has been raising sheep since she was a girl and she knows how to do it. \r\n\r\nJoaquina has a son with special needs and he goes to a special school.

With the help of her past 14 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Margie has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 21,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6,500, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 15th loan, she is borrowing PHP 22,000, which she intends to buy tailoring materials so that she could continue to save up for future home repairs and education of her children. Margie is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. About NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She earns her living by operating two business ventures: selling of fruits and a general store businesses. Her husband Antonio P., who is 61 years old, works as a carpenter to earn his living.  They have two children who are 34 and 39 years old. And they have already a job of their own. Cecilia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2006 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 10 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Cecilia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 20,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 31,200, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 11th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 22,000, which she intends to use to pay for more buy stocks of fruits to sell to a market so that she could continue to save up for future family needs. Cecilia is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

V. is from the village of Esperanza West.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from planting and harvesting rice for sale. Simplicio has been engaged in his business for over 14 years and earns approximately 30000 PHP per harvest.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Simplicio joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Simplicio is requesting a oan of 21000 PHP, which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. This loan will be the 1st loan taken out by Simplicio from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand his business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas.

To make a living, Emerlinda owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector running a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food & daily use products in the local community. Emerlinda has been engaged in her business for over 2 years and earns approximately 3500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Emerlinda joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Emerlinda has successfully repaid a previous loan  from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. Emerlinda is requesting a new loan of 15000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. This loan will be the 8th loan taken out by Emerlinda from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

She will hire a worker who will collect orders from different boutiques and clothes-selling shops. With the loan, she will buy supplies such as cloth, beads and colored thread in bulk. Then she will fulfill the orders on time and increase her sales. \r\n\r\nHer elder son also does embroidery. He learned this art from Bilqees and helps her in completing the orders on time. Her second son is a driver by profession. Her daughter is 11 years old and stays at home.

C. is from the village of Taguilon. She is 47 years old. Evangeline is married and has three school aged children. To make a living, she owns and operates a fishing boat. She has been engaged in her business for over fifteen years and earns approximately $100 a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Evangeline joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and to have the ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,000 PHP from PMPC. \r\n\r\nEvangeline is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase materials for fishing boat repair. This will be her 2nd loan from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in north-western Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

By working very hard, Efra\u00edn has been able to make his fields very fertile and productive. Every day, he works in his fields with dedication, constantly improving his crops. He takes his harvest to sell at the wholesale market of the city of Pichanaki, where he generally receives very good earnings. What he likes most about his work is cultivating his crops. He has done this work for six years already, and he thinks the hardest part is transporting his products to distant areas. Over time, he hopes to buy new land to expand his plantings and increase his earnings. This is Efra\u00edn's second loan with MFP; he has been very punctual with his previous payments and he plans to continue in the same way. In his communal bank, he is a very responsible member who always keeps up to date with the agreements made by the group. Efra\u00edn plans to invest the two thousand Peruvian soles he is requesting in buying fertilizer and insecticides for his fields, and he hopes to improve his production.

Yanacoto\u201d is one of the most united community banks that we have in our agency.  The members have been working with EDAPROSPO for 6 years.  One of the longest-standing members of this group is 48 year-old Basilia.  Basilia is a single mother with four children, one of whom is still a minor.  She works in a number of business activities such as: selling clothes to order, selling 'cebiche' (marinated fish) and selling fruit.  She makes all of her sales as an itinerant street vendor.  She also makes jewelry (necklaces and bracelets).  The small income she makes from this work helps her to cover her youngest son's education expenses and her household expenses.\r\n\r\nBasilia requested her loan from EDAPROSPO in order to buy jewelry materials (murano glass, cat's-eyes, natural stones, elastic and cotton) for making bracelets and necklaces that her customers have requested from her.  She will also make sportswear and shirts for the back-to-school season.\r\n\r\nBasilia would like to improve her home so that she can have her own work space.

Her future plans are to have a wholesale store and to have enough money to give her children all their needs and to pay for their degree studies.\r\n\r\nAlina is just one member of the 10 person group, La Alternativa 4 & 5. Together, these Dominican entrepreneurs are able unite in solidarity, allowing them access to funding that they would otherwise never be able to receive on their own.

Alina started her business with her first loan from Esperanza.\r\n\r\nThis Esperanza associate began with us around 5 years ago, and this is her 11th loan.

By working hard at her furniture-making and food vending businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of 6,000 Philippine pesos (PHP).\r\n\r\nFor this loan, Elizabeth is borrowing 15,000 PHP so she can purchase more materials and inventory. This will be her ninth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 15,000 PHP, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom.

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jannette B. is from the village of Gosi Sur. She is 47 years old and the group leader of a four-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Jannette B.'s Group.\r\n\r\nJannette is married. To make a living, she owns and operates a general store, selling a variety of different products in the local community. She has been engaged in her business for over twenty-five years and earns approximately $94 a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, she joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase new items to expand her product offering.\r\n\r\nJannette is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be her 2nd loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business as savings for future emergencies. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful micro-finance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":692277,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

People living outside the major urban areas rely almost entirely upon herding and subsistence farming. Thanks to herding, the development of dairy businesses is being promoted.\r\n<br>Ainura J., 32, is the leader of this group. She and her husband devote their whole time to taking care of a couple of dairy cows. Every day, early in the morning, Ainura milks several liters and heads to a local market to sell the milk to customers. Ainura is very happy with her business, since her milk is of good quality and is always in high demand. The family started this business eight years ago with capital of 15,000 KGS. A monthly income of 9,000 KGS has helped them to raise three children, who are in school now. \r\n<br>Ainura has gathered this group of ambitious entrepreneurs in order to request a loan, which she is sure will be repaid by the established deadline. Ainura hopes to use her loan to purchase another dairy cow. She plans to spend her business returns on a good university education for her children.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Where did this loan come from?<\/b><br>\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.

Several farmers joined together in farming activities such as agriculture, cattle breeding and dairy production. This was a strategy for boosting the country\u2019s production. Unfortunately, \u201ckolkhozy\u201d failed after the collapse of the Soviet Union, leaving hundreds of thousands of peasants managing the land on their own. \r\n<br>Sairagul S., 43, is the leader of this group. In Soviet times she used to be a dairymaid in a local \u201ckolkhoz\u201d. Like many others, she was left helpless after the collapse of Soviet Union. Having no education, but excellent skills in cattle breeding, she decided to continue this occupation. Three years ago, Sairagul ventured into the resale of cattle, which proved successful. Nowadays she spends most of her time taking care of cattle, but she also works as a salesperson in a nearby market on weekdays. Sairagul earns 6,000 KGS per month, but she still is unable to purchase some sheep for resale. In order to accomplish this goal she has applied for a loan from Kiva. Sairagul would like to spend her business returns on finishing the construction of her house, which she started two years ago. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>Where did this loan come from?<\/b><br>\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

In that season, Inomjon acquired adequate income and that income was used to improve his home and to save for the children\u2019s education expenses. \r\n\r\nBecause he spent the season diligently selling fertilizer, his own land is unprepared for planting. Currently, it is the rainy season, the  appropriate and suitable time for planting. Inomjon has taken the initiative to resume working on his land while selling fertilizer.

Inomjon is optimistic that his venture will be successful and all his efforts will improve the family\u2019s welfare.    \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes having been a key post along the Silk Road and having witnessed the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC, and communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
