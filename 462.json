His success, however, all boils down to his diligence and steadfast entrepreneurial spirit.\r\n\r\nThis happily married father of six says he began his business with savings from his former fishmonger business. In a week he makes 80,000 Ugandan shillings as profits. He also operates a commercial motorcycle transportation business commonly referred to here as boda-boda.\r\n\r\nSsenoga\u2019s reckoning is that this loan will come in handy to financially help him to buy more bananas to sell and also to pay for repairs to his motorcycle.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2725,"image":{"id":599725,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

Amer works in tiling: casting tiles and polishing them. Amer has been working in this field for 22 years and is always keen to develop his work. It is Amer's second loan from the Group and he has a good credit history. His first loan had a positive impact on the development of his work. This time, he seeks funding to buy a small pickup truck to facilitate the transfer of his tools and tiles to and from his workshop. His professionalism has helped him gain the trust of his clients, whether they be neighbors, relatives or friends of friends. Amer seeks to expand his business in the future, with the ultimate aim of entering the public contracting business.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Arabic by Rania ElMaraghy, Kiva

Since 1994, he has owned a small grocery store in the area of Bint Jbeil. The store earns a living for him, his wife, and his three children. Hatem sells food products in his store, including soft drinks, water, canned products, vegetables and fruits, as well as toys and gifts. Due the region\u2019s difficult economic conditions, Hatem also works as driver, transporting students and to and from their schools during the academic year. His good reputation in the area is the main reason behind his success, as he has all the qualities that motivate parents to use his services in transporting their children. Hatem had previously dealt with Al Majmoua, and was well able to repay his loan. He is now coming forward with a request for another loan to purchase a car that will help him earn additional income. The loan will also help him pay school expenses and purchase new school stationery for his children. His diligence is the secret to his success. Hatem aims to grow in the future by owning a transportation network that services students, or through expanding in the grocery and wholesale food products field.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

She is a widow and has three children: two grown daughters, who live on their own, and one son, who is the main light of Ainash\u2019s life.  \r\n\r\nShe works in a local school in Naryn city and is characterized as a very well-wishing and positive person. As it was very hard to live on a low wage and to bring the children up by herself, Ainash decided to begin her own business in cattle breeding. In 2000, using her initial capital of 10,000 soms (KGS), she bought cattle for fattening and reselling. Because of an absence of appropriate conditions for livestock maintenance, Ainash decided to keep them in the neighboring village, at the farm of her mother-in-law. Such assistance from her late husband\u2019s family serves as an example of the deeply rooted, warm relations between them and Ainash. \r\n\r\nIn 2008,  Ainash applied for a loan of 100,000 KGS, which she used to buy more cattle. The revenues from this loan were used to pay for an education for Ainash\u2019s son, who was eager to be a serviceman and successfully entered the military academy. \r\n\r\nNow Ainash intends to use this loan of 100,000 KGS to broaden her business by purchasing 18 sheep and five bull-calves. In the future, using the revenues, she plans to construct her own barn near the house. \r\n\r\nBai-Tushum and Partners uses Kiva funding to target the especially vulnerable population.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Manzura is 29 years old and she is a very good entrepreneur. She is married and the loving mother of two children. Her husband has no fixed job and this is the reason that two years ago she decided to start her own business. Manzura started with very little merchandise, but little by little her business grew and she started to sell clothes with excellent results. She is very clear about the secret of success in a business. She knows it is the variety of products that she offers because if a client is looking for something that she does not have, he or she may never return to her. For this reason, she tries to be fully stocked. Manzura is requesting a loan of $1,000 USD to purchase merchandise and new clothes for the season.\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

","en":"Mohamad is a 33-year-old, single man from Bint Jbeil. Since 2005 he has owned a bookstore, in which he sells school books, stationery, school bags and photography. Mohamad previously dealt with A.-Majmoua and enjoys a good reputation. He is now asking for a loan to boost his business as the new academic year approaches. In the beginning he lacked capitA. and he improved it with the previous loan he obtained from the group. The business is now developing gradually. His good manner with customers and his reasonable prices at a time of economic difficulties distinguish him and his business from other bookshops in the neighborhood. Mohamad hopes to one day open another branch in another area and to keep developing his business to include different areas.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Arabic by Rebecca Saab Saade, Kiva

They have been living in a two-room little house made of bricks for the last 15 years.  \r\n\r\nBashiran has applied for a loan from Asasah for her husband\u2019s business. With the loan, he will buy a new donkey cart because the old cart has become rough and rotten in different areas. Due to its roughness Bashiran\u2019s husband can\u2019t put heavy loads on it and, as a result, his business is affected. Bashiran is hopeful that by purchasing a new donkey cart, her husband will be able to do his work more comfortably and make more income.\r\nShe is a regular user of Asasah and has a good credit record. This is her fourth loan application.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":601115,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"To

","en":"Adel is married and lives in Tyre with his wife and 3 children. He is ambitious, and is tired of his van, which he uses for the work he\u2019s been doing since 2000; selling coffee, tea, and hookahs as a peddler, roaming from one village to the other in Tyre. Adel often settles in one location where his regular customers hang out. The quality of his product and his hygiene standards encourage many people, including friends, neighbors, and tourists, to buy his products. Adel has previously dealt with Al-Majmoua and has a good borrowing history. His previous loan had a positive impact on his life, as it significantly improved his financial situation.

Sr., who is 50 years old, works as a carpenter to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have six children who are 17 to 28 years old. \r\n\r\nCorazon joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1997 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 10 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Corazon has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 18,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 9000 PHP, uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 11th loan, she is borrowing 18,000 PHP, which she intends to use to buy more foodstuffs to sell in her coffee shop and her general store to sustain her businesses and continue to save for future home repairs and expansion of her business. Corazon A. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

L. is a married woman who lives in Bangkal Highway, Brgy. Jonobjonob, Escalante City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures: a sari-sari (general) store and a computer-gaming business. Her husband Antonio L., who is 60 years old, also helps with his wife's business activities. They have 4 children who range in age from 21 to 33 years old. Two of her children have their own families. \r\n\r\nAracili joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 12 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Aracili has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 20,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 12,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 13th loan, she is borrowing PHP 22,000, which she intends to use as revolving capital for her general store so that she can earn enough to continue to save up for the future to improve their house and for their basic needs. Aracili L. is a Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\") woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF: <b>\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon. Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

M. is a 46-year-old married woman who supports her family by operating three business ventures:  selling Ready-to-Wear (RTW) clothes, raising livestock and food vending. She lives in Purok 6, Brgy. Cubay, La Carlota City, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2006 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. \r\n\r\nBy working hard in her RTW sales, livestock and food vending businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of 7,200 PHP. Suzette is now borrowing 15,000 PHP to sustain and grow her businesses. This will be her sixth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 12,000 PHP, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom. Suzette aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

C. is a 36-year-old married woman who supports her family by operating two business ventures:  seaweed (guso) farming and food vending. She lives in Pulo, Brgy Cervantes, Escalante City, Negros Occidental. She cultures Eucheuma seaweed (guso) along the coast line and sells it as raw material for carrageenan, a very in-demand binder used in food products. Because seaweed farming does not involve constant work, Arlen can earn additional income by selling cooked food, doubling her earning capacity.\r\n\r\nShe has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 1996 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her seaweed (guso) farming and food vending businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of 15,000. \r\n\r\nArlen is now borrowing PHP 19,000 to purchase seaweed materials and use as additional capital for food vending.  This will be her 8eighth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 19,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Arlen aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She is 40 years old and happily married with two kids, both of whom are attending school in Namengo-Lugazi. \r\n\r\nTo get a viable and sustainable financial means of subsistence that she and her family could rely on, she began her fish selling business two years ago. To take root in this business, she had to use savings from her bar business, which is still a side business for her. In a week, out of her fish business, she makes profits totaling up to 500,000 shillings.  \r\n\r\nUnder the auspices of this loan, Fatuma wants to boost her business by buying more fish to resell and some to smoke and keep as reserve just in case client demand goes up. Just like in any other part of Uganda, fish customers in Lugazi normally have preferences, some an inclination for smoked fish and some fancy fresh fish. The upshot of increased sales, Fatuma gleefully says, is going to be an increase in profits for her business. This, she says, will improve the longevity of her business and, most important, enable her to give her kids a better education.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":601035,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","use":"The purchase of more fish for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Lugazi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.377222 32.919722","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2010-09-18T23:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatuma ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Regina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Shamimu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Livingstone","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florence","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":1550000,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":96875},{"due_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":96875},{"due_date":"2010-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":96875},{"due_date":"2010-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":96875},{"due_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":96875},{"due_date":"2010-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":96875},{"due_date":"2010-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":96875},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96875},{"due_date":"2010-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":96875},{"due_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":96875},{"due_date":"2010-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":96875},{"due_date":"2010-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":96875},{"due_date":"2010-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":96875},{"due_date":"2010-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":96875},{"due_date":"2010-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":96875},{"due_date":"2010-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":96875}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":290625,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T09:16:22Z","rounded_local_amount":295312.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172297363,"comment":null},{"amount":175,"local_amount":387500,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:36:10Z","rounded_local_amount":393750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177467647,"comment":null},{"amount":218.75,"local_amount":484375,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:22:24Z","rounded_local_amount":492187.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182605735,"comment":null},{"amount":175,"local_amount":387500,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:25:41Z","rounded_local_amount":393750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188744799,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-09-19T02:21:30Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T14:25:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":231626,"name":"Baby Rose","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Baby Rose S. is a married woman who lives in Prk.

They have two children who are 1 and 10 years old. \r\n\r\nBaby Rose joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2003 because she wanted something better for her family.

Her previous loan of 19,500 Philippine pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of 6,000 PHP, improving the family's standard of living. This time, for her 10th loan, she is borrowing 19,500 PHP, which she intends to use to purchase more seashells to sell so that she can continue to save up for the future to meet their daily needs.

Hiyang-hiyang, Barangay Patag, Silay City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating three business ventures: a general store, a pig fattening business and a charcoal selling business. Her husband, Domingueto P., who is 46 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have two children who are 21 and 31 years old. \r\n\r\nMerlita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2003 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 13 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Merlita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 25,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of $575, raising the family's standard of living. \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 14th cycle loan, she is borrowing 25,000 PHP again, which she intends to use to buy inventory to sell in her general store so that she can continue to earn and save up for future expansion of her businesses. Merlita P. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She earns her living by operating a Carenderia or eatery  business.  Her husband Nonilo P., who is 41 years old, works as a Carpenter and Plumber to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have 4 children who are 3 to 20 years old. \r\n\r\nEdna joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1998 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 13 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Edna has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 20000,  uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 14th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 20000, which she intends to use to purchase of raw food ingredients to cook and sell in her carenderia or eatery so that she could continue to earn and  save up for future for the education of her children. Edna P. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

B. is a married woman who lives in Sitio Cagay, Brgy Buenavista, Escalante City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures: selling ready to wear clothes and direct-selling of Natasha products, a popular low-cost line of personal care products. Her husband Ismael B. Jr., who is 40 years old, works as a Baker to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have 5 children who are 3 to 20 years old. \r\n\r\nGina joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1994 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 13 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Gina has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 15000,  uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 14th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 19500, which she intends to use to purchase of more product to sell so that she could continue to save up for future house improvements. Gina B. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

She lives in Prk. Santan I, Brgy Old Sagay, Sagay City, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 1998 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her sari-sari (general) store business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average income of PHP 4000. \r\n\r\nGloria is now borrowing PHP 15000 so that she could  purchase more products to sell in her Sari-sari store.  This will be her 11th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 15000, which she paid off well within its term was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Gloria aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well eing by following the  Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

D. is a married woman who lives in Hda.

They have three children who are 16 to 30 years old, with two of their children having their own families and only one living at home to help Heide in her business activity. \r\n\r\nHeide joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1999 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 9 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Heide has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 19,000 PHP, which she added to her own capital, helped her earn a monthly profit of $1184, raising the family's standard of living. \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 10th cycle loan, she is borrowing 19,000 PHP again to supplement her own capital so that she can buy more fruits to sell. Heide is working hard so that she can sustain her family's daily needs and be able to save up for the education of her youngest child, and to set aside some money for the future security of her family. Heide D. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\r\nHelp NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by clicking the link to the NWTF Kiva lending team on Kiva.org to join our

His family consists of his wife and his three children who are 19, 17, and 16 years old.  Omar is a pork merchant.  He started his business when he got married because he had to leave his parents\u2019 house and had to find a way to support his wife.  He started buying pigs to butcher and sell the meat to grocery stores and butcheries.\r\n\r\nOne of the advantages of the business is that it is very profitable and this has allowed him to support his family although with many economic limitations.  One of the disadvantages is that the market is saturated with people who do the same kind of work and some of them, in order to sell their products quickly, do so at such low prices that he is unable to compete.\r\n\r\nWith the support this loan gives him he hopes to have sufficient profits to support his household and to buy school supplies, uniforms and shoes that his children need to go to school.\r\n\r\nHis fellow group member, Iris, sells snacks.

This will be her 7th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 16,000 PHP, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom.

She earns her living by operating three business ventures: a sari-sari (variety) store, P.O Card (cash cards) and a Natasha dealership (selling shoes, apparel, accessories and personal care products by catalog order). Her husband, Cirilo R., who is 50 years old, helps his wife in running the business. They have four children, ranging in age from 24 to 29. \r\n\r\nElsa joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2001 because she wanted something better for her family. With the help of her past 18 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Elsa  has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 10,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of about $100, raising the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 19th cycle loan, she is borrowing 10,000 PHP again, to purchase inventory to sell in her sari-sari store and to buy more p.o cards to sell so that she can continue to save up for the future, to continue her businesses and to expand them for a lifetime. Elsa R. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

With the help of her past 16 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Paulina has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 19,500 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of approximately $230, raising the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 17th cycle loan, she is borrowing 19,500 PHP, which she intends to use to purchase more stock to sell in her general store so that she can continue to save up for the future and for her children's higher education. Paulina B. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\r\nHelp NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by clicking the link to the NWTF Kiva lending team on Kiva.org to join our

G. is a married woman who lives in Sitio. Bulobito-on, Barangay Miranda, Hinigaran, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures: a general store and a fish vending business. Her husband, Antonio G., who is 67 years old, earns his living as a fish vendor, and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have six children who are 5 to 18 years old. \r\n\r\nRebecca joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2001 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 13 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Rebecca has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 14,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of about $103, raising the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 14th cycle loan, she is borrowing 12,000 PHP, which she intends to use to buy more inventory to sell in her general store so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Rebecca G. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

district. These individuals' livelihoods consist mainly of store sales, clothing sales, the manufacture of leather crafts, cooking and selling homemade bread, pies, empanadas, and handmade knitted items. \r\n\r\nAngela is the president of the group. In the photo she can be found in the furthest row above, and third from the left. She has been selling used clothing for the past two years in a kiosk at two fairs close to her house.  Before this she sold articles of leather; for example, coin purses, wallets and cigarette cases, among other things. She decided to change her merchandise to test sales, and thankfully it has gone very well.

belongs to the communal bank \u201cFeria Fluvial\u201d located in Valdivia. She has a stand where she sells fish and shrimp in the fair \u201cFeria Fluvial\u201d in the city.  This fair is part of a commercial part of the city beside the river Calle Calle, and this explains the name of the fair, as \"fluvial\" refers to a body of water, river or lake.\r\n  \r\nMixy\u00b4s stand has been part of the family business for at least 60 years, when her grandmother used to run the business. She has run the stand for the past eight years along with her mother and aunt.  With this loan, Mixy would like to purchase a freezer to store the pre-cooked shrimp and sell them to local restaurants. \r\n\r\nShe is the mother of four: 19, 17, and 10 year olds and a newborn only six months old. Only the three youngest reside with her. Mixy dreams of owning her own house, for which she applied for a mortgage and will receive news by the end of September. \r\n\r\nMixy likes that the payments to Fondo Esperanza are weekly, as they allow her to ask for how much she needs and is able to pay it little by little.

This is Gloria's first experience as president.\r\n\r\nGloria's dream is to convert her stall into a wholesale and retail distributership and seller of fish of the highest quality and the greatest variety. To do that, the loan will be used to increase her working capital and, in this manner, to satisfy the greatest possible demand.\r\n\r\nIn the photo, Gloria is standing, wearing a blue sweater and a flowered white blouse.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Harold Sims, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1400,"image":{"id":601395,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","use":"TO OPEN A NEW STALL IN THE MARKET DUE TO  THE GREAT DEMAND FOR FISH","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"San Juan de Lurigancho-Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.033333 -77.016667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2010-09-21T07:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gloria Rosario","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Karin Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elisabeth Amparo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sofia Victoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maximino","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Altemira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3850,"loan_amount":1400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":963},{"due_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":963},{"due_date":"2010-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":963},{"due_date":"2011-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":961}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":350.18},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":350.18},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":350.19},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":349.45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":350.18,"local_amount":963,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:36:06Z","rounded_local_amount":976.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177390890,"comment":null},{"amount":350.18,"local_amount":963,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:44:03Z","rounded_local_amount":976.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182529170,"comment":null},{"amount":350.19,"local_amount":963,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:52:11Z","rounded_local_amount":976.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188665278,"comment":null},{"amount":349.45,"local_amount":961,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:51:27Z","rounded_local_amount":974.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191408526,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-09-21T17:11:03Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T02:51:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":231729,"name":"Mujeres Reunidas Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"En la ciudad de Yaguar\u00f3n, distante a 8 Kms de la Oficina de Paraguar\u00ed, se reunieron unas mujeres con el objetivo de  aumentar su capital de trabajo y para emprender actividades productivas, de ah\u00ed que coordinamos la reuni\u00f3n para interiorizarse sobre el programa, a quienes les pareci\u00f3 interesante por ser una  oportunidad crediticia muy buena.\nEl comit\u00e9 lleva por nombre Mujeres Reunidas debido a que todas las integrantes coinciden de que \u00e9sta oportunidad les servir\u00e1 de esperanza para progresar, actualmente se encuentran en el quinto ciclo, integrada por 18  luchadoras se\u00f1oras, quienes se esmeran d\u00edas tras d\u00edas para aumentar sus ingresos y por ende brindarle lo mejor a sus respectivas familias.

Iris works in trade, and her main activity is selling groceries. She operates this business under the name of the \"IRIS\" neighborhood store. She has done this work for several years, and it is worth noting that she has known how to manage it well, since her business has remained stable during all this time. Its location is very accessible, because it is on one side of the main highway toward Trojes, next to the clinic of Dr. Gonzalo Lobo. For this reason, she has a very good customer base; people from areas that are farther away come to this clinic, and on their way, they pick up some products from Iris' neighborhood store. \r\n\r\nIn addition to her store, Iris works selling blouses, sandals and lotions. She makes most of her sales of these products going door to door and selling them on credit. Her husband helps her with this, selling and collecting payments while she is tending the store. \r\n\r\nIt is worth mentioning that her living conditions have improved significantly. Iris is married and has one daughter, who is also married, and thus she no longer depends on Iris economically. \r\n\r\nShe will use the loan to buy merchandise to stock her store. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":601421,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"Buying soap, milk, soft drinks, fried snacks, beans, shortening, oil, rice, sugar, tortillas, bread, cookies, coffee, pasta, soups, sauces, toilet paper, batteries, matches, candles, juices, eggs, and salt.

His wife helps him with some of the expenses by selling books.  They have four children.  Sometimes their oldest child helps him sell the newspapers.  He works from 7:00 a.m. until 1:00 p.m. everyday.\r\n\r\nIn order to help his children with their education, he wants to use the loan to buy books and notebooks.  He will use some of the loan to pay the school fees.  In the future he wants to have a vehicle so that he no longer has to use his bicycle when he sells.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":601502,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","use":"Books and notebooks","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Guayaquil (Isla)","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":147,"posted_date":"2010-09-17T15:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan Miguel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":600,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":94.09},{"due_date":"2010-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":96.65},{"due_date":"2010-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":98.51},{"due_date":"2010-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":101.03},{"due_date":"2011-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":103.14},{"due_date":"2011-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":106.58}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.09},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.65},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":98.51},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101.03},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103.14},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":94,"local_amount":94,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:06:20Z","rounded_local_amount":94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172112441,"comment":null},{"amount":96.74,"local_amount":96.74,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:55:27Z","rounded_local_amount":96.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177405878,"comment":null},{"amount":98.51,"local_amount":98.51,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:05:16Z","rounded_local_amount":98.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182544344,"comment":null},{"amount":101.03,"local_amount":101.03,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:08:09Z","rounded_local_amount":101.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188681100,"comment":null},{"amount":103.14,"local_amount":103.14,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T01:46:15Z","rounded_local_amount":103.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191379426,"comment":null},{"amount":106.58,"local_amount":106.58,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:23:25Z","rounded_local_amount":106.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195797412,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-09-17T17:47:40Z","paid_date":"2011-03-15T11:23:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":231773,"name":"Las Minas (Cuenca) Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El banco comunal Las Minas se encuentra formado por 8 mujeres  y 2 hombres, quienes luchan para sacar adelante a sus familias con su trabajo diario.

She has a lathe (a machine for cutting the tagua) which she uses to make the buttons. She then delivers the product to wholesalers in Manta, who send them abroad to be finished. She works from Monday to Friday and on Saturdays she selects the buttons she will take to be sold. She buys semi-processed tagua in Manta, using this kind because it is faster to work with.\r\n\r\nShe will use this loan to buy raw materials because she would like to increase her production and

She delivers her product wholesale to merchants in Manta.  These merchants send the buttons to foreign countries to be finished.\r\n\r\nShe only works from Monday through Friday from 8:00 a.m. until 4:00 p.m.  She gets the raw material in Manta.

F. is from the village of Bitnong, Dupax del Norte, Nueva Vizcaya. She is 54 years old and married with six adult children. To make a living, Rosa owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops. The main source of income for the business comes from planting and harvesting a variety of vegetables for sale. Rosa has been engaged in her business for over 15 years and earns approximately 6,500 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Rosa joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Rosa has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from ASKI, which was used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings and young crops to raise. Rosa is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP to purchase fertilizers such as manure. This will be her third loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI: ASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 21 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

This will be the second loan taken out by Efelia from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\n<b>About ASKI:<\/b>\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

K.  lives in the northwest of Kyrgyzstan. She is married and has four children. She graduated from the Kyrgyz National University and works as a teacher of mathematics in the local school. She is known as a person who sets her whole heart on her pupils' education. Taking into account her striving to make children progressive, she is titled as an Honoured Education Worker.  \r\n\r\nAs it is known, in rural areas, the salaries of teachers are low and do not cover all the expenses of a household. That\u2019s why these people need to find an additional means of subsistence for their families. Kulbara, like many others in such a situation, began her own business in cattle breeding and land cultivating. Starting from buying one cow, she managed to enlarge the number of livestock to 10 sheep, one milk cow, one calf and one horse. Also, Kulbara has a beautiful small-scale garden with apples, pears and raspberries, which gives her some earnings for supporting her children.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Vilma has been engaged in her business for over six years and earns approximately 3,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) a month from it.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Vilma joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Vilma is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be the first loan taken out by Vilma from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of her family. \r\n\r\n<b>About ASKI:<\/b>\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":597767,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To invest in expanding the business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Calaocan Quezon, Nueva Vizcaya","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":123,"posted_date":"2010-09-20T03:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vilma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":5000,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":209},{"due_date":"2010-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":209},{"due_date":"2010-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":209},{"due_date":"2010-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":209},{"due_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":209},{"due_date":"2010-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":209},{"due_date":"2010-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":209},{"due_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":209},{"due_date":"2010-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":209},{"due_date":"2010-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":209},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":209},{"due_date":"2010-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":209},{"due_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":209},{"due_date":"2010-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":209},{"due_date":"2010-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":209},{"due_date":"2010-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":209},{"due_date":"2010-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":209},{"due_date":"2010-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":209},{"due_date":"2010-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":209},{"due_date":"2011-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":209},{"due_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":209},{"due_date":"2011-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":209},{"due_date":"2011-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":209},{"due_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":193}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5.23},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5.22},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5.23},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5.22},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5.23},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5.22},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5.23},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5.22},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5.23},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5.22},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5.23},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5.22},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5.23},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5.22},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5.23},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5.22},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5.23},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5.22},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5.23},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5.22},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5.23},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5.22},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5.23},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4.82}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":31.35,"local_amount":1254,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:28:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1386.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172049123,"comment":null},{"amount":20.9,"local_amount":836,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T12:23:26Z","rounded_local_amount":924.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177339848,"comment":null},{"amount":26.13,"local_amount":1045,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T12:22:07Z","rounded_local_amount":1155.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182474664,"comment":null},{"amount":20.9,"local_amount":836,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T11:54:12Z","rounded_local_amount":924.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188611492,"comment":null},{"amount":25.72,"local_amount":1029,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T01:11:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1137.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191356380,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-09-20T05:46:29Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T01:11:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":231986,"name":"Ezekiel Kariuki","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ezekiel has operated his butcher shop in Naivasha town for the last 12 years.

Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb (20213050012) is a 42 year-old woman living in the town of huy\u1ec7n Y\u00ean Phong.  She is married and has 3 adul -aged children.  To making a living, S. owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector running a general store.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food & daily use products in the local community.  S. has been engaged in this business for over 10 years and earns approximately 5.000.000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2008, S. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  S. has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6.048.000 VND from SEDA.  This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell.  S. is now requesting a new loan of 8.288.000 VND which will be used to invest in expanding the business.  The loan will be the 4th loan taken out by the borrower from SEDA.  S. plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nAbout SEDA:\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to the low income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the Northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":601901,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She is a widow and has 4 older children; only the youngest still attends school.  Marta only studied through 6th grade, and didn't continue because of a lack of financial resources. She lives with her family in their own house and helps support two of her grandchildren who live with them.\r\n\r\nShe continues to live in Matola and has owned her own business for more than 2 years. For the most part she sells frozen chicken and fish, earning a monthly profit of around 3000 to 4000 Meticais. She uses this income to cover household expenses and occasionally saves some money at home as well.\r\n\r\nMarta had taken out loans with other banks but decided to try something different. She found out about Hluvuku [the Kiva Field Partner] through neighbors who also work with the institution. This is her 1st loan, for the amount of 20,000 Meticais. She plans to use this money to buy products (chicken, fish, soft drinks and other items) to increase her stock of merchandise. \r\n\r\nShe is confident that she will be able to repay the loan as indicated and take out new loans later.  In the future she would like to further develop her business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":601906,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchase

Nghi\u00eam Th\u1ecb (20213050023) is a 28 year-old woman living in the town of huy\u1ec7n Y\u00ean Phong - t\u1ec9nh B\u1eafc Ninh.  She is married and has 2 school-aged children.  To making a living, H. owns & operates a business venture in the food sector making & selling food.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling herbs & spices in the local community.  H. has been engaged in this business for over 5 years and earns approximately 3.000.000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, H. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  H. has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,152,000 VND from SEDA.  This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell.  H. is now requesting a new loan of 8,288,000 VND which will be used to purchase additional inventory & working capital.  The loan will be the 4th loan taken out by her from SEDA.  H. plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand the  business.\r\n\r\nAbout SEDA:\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to the low income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the Northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":601908,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

To make a living, H. makes and sells food. The main source of income for the business comes from selling rice products in the local community. H. has been engaged in this business for over two years and earns approximately 4.000.000 Vietnamese Dong (VND) a month from it.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, H. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. H. has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5.152.000 VND from SEDA. This previous loan was used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale.  \r\n\r\nH. is now requesting a new loan of 8.736.000 VND, which will also be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. This will be her fourth loan from SEDA.  \r\n\r\nH. plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support extended members of her family.\r\n\r\n<b>About SEDA:<\/b>\r\n\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to the low-income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the Northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Sor M. is 30 years old, married and the mother of one young child who is already enrolled in primary school.
