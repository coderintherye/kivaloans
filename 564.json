She lives in Olmos, an agricultural area with quite a lot of commercial activity which is located in Lambayeque province, more than one and a half hours from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nFor 6 years, Santos has had a small grocery store located in her home where she sells food products and essentials.  She is located almost 30 minutes from the village of Olmos.  Owing to this distance, Santos' business is one of the few grocery stores in her region.  Consequently, she has an established and loyal customer base and manages to make a good profit margin.  She would like to expand her business by purchasing more merchandise such as rice, sugar and oil.  By investing her loan, she will increase her income and improve her own and her husband's quality of life.\r\n\r\nSantos has had previous loans which she has repaid punctually.

Dong Hai Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mui P. T. (7) is a 74-year-old female living in the town of Thanh Hoa. She is the group leader of a six-member group loan offered by Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is 05-Dong Hai (016-06-05 Dong Hai).\r\n\r\nMui is widowed and has five adult-aged children. To make a living, she owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector operating a specialized retail store, selling confectionery products in the local community. Mui has been engaged in this business for over twelve years and earns approximately $120 a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, Mui joined Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Mui has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4,248,000 VND from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. She is now requesting a new loan of 5,787,900 VND which will be used to purchase additional products to sell.  This will be her 8th loan from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women. Mui plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to save as a reserve for future emergencies.\r\n\r\nAbout the Other Borrowers in the Group:\r\n\r\n1.  D. Phuong Anh (48) is requesting a 5,787,900 VND loan to support her business in the food sector running a food stall.\r\n\r\n2.  P. T. Hong Van (47) is requesting a 5,787,900 VND loan to support her business in the services sector operating a tailoring business.\r\n\r\n3.  N. T. Ngan (16) is requesting a 5,787,900 VND loan to support her business in the retail sector operating a specialized retail store.\r\n\r\n4.  N.

Nga (73) is requesting a 5,787,900 VND loan to support her business in the food sector making and selling food.\r\n\r\nAbout Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women:\r\n\r\nThe mission of Fund for Thanh Hoa Poor Women (FPW) is to provide sustainable financial services to disadvantaged women in rural areas in the Thanh Hoa province.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\nMui P.

Jr. is from the village of Del Pilar, Cabatuan, Isabela. He is 45 years old, married, and has three adult children. To make a living, Domingo owns and operates a business venture making and selling food. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling fish balls and other dim sums to the local community. Domingo has been engaged in his business for over five years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Domingo joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Domingo has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from ASKI, which was used to purchase additional products to sell. Domingo is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will also be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be Domingo's third loan from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand his business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherpeople, and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

This area, like nearly all impoverished areas of the Dominican Republic suffers from unreliable running water (none of which is potable) and electricity you can't count on. The town also has a large Dominican and Haitian immigrant population who live with very limited resources. They love to listen and dance to music in their free time.\n\nJohanna is very excited to receive her first loan with Esperanza Internacional. She plans to invest her new loan in her business. She sells silver jewelry. She will use her income to renovate her home and to purchase some needed items. She lives together with her husband and their only child."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1725,"image":{"id":732879,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Jewelry","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy silver jewelry for resale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"DO","country":"Dominican Republic","town":"Santo Domingo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"18.466667 -69.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":44,"posted_date":"2011-03-17T22:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Johanna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Genova","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sarah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teodora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-02-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"DOP","disbursal_amount":64000,"loan_amount":1725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":5211.43},{"due_date":"2011-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":5005.46},{"due_date":"2011-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":5084.17},{"due_date":"2011-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":5164.17},{"due_date":"2011-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":5245.45},{"due_date":"2011-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":5328.06},{"due_date":"2011-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":5411.95},{"due_date":"2011-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":5497.23},{"due_date":"2011-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":5583.85},{"due_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":5671.85},{"due_date":"2011-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":5761.28},{"due_date":"2011-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":5035.1}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140.46},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.92},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.03},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":139.19},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.38},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.61},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.87},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":148.17},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":152.87},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":155.29},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.71}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":412.41,"local_amount":15301.06,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:55:23Z","rounded_local_amount":15424.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201275383,"comment":null},{"amount":280.57,"local_amount":10409.62,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:54:52Z","rounded_local_amount":10493.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206142643,"comment":null},{"amount":289.48,"local_amount":10740.01,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:07:11Z","rounded_local_amount":10826.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211215639,"comment":null},{"amount":298.67,"local_amount":11081.08,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:59:01Z","rounded_local_amount":11170.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216494014,"comment":null},{"amount":443.87,"local_amount":16468.23,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-17T07:46:25Z","rounded_local_amount":16600.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221657411,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-03-21T16:56:13Z","paid_date":"2011-08-17T07:46:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":282634,"name":"Tatyana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tatyana sells men's clothing at one of the markets in Melitopol city and has been in this business for 14 years.

The business was inherited from her husband\u2019s parents, who gave them some cattle for further breeding. \r\n<p>\r\nAnarkan remembers painfully a time when all families involved in cattle breeding faced fierce economic conditions. Severe winters and extremely dry summers led to a lack of hay for cattle, and the volume of milk received fell dramatically. Anarkan was on the brink of giving up the business, but it was the only thing she had ever done, so she persisted, and survived that period.\r\n<p>\r\nIt's been 25 years since she got involved in cattle breeding. Nowadays the monthly profit reaches 3000 soms. Some of the household electrical appliances are out of order, including Anarkan\u2019s washing machine.

She is 50 years old, is married and has one child. . Leonila is the group leader of a two-member group loan offered by PMPC. While each member receives an individual loan, they are each responsible for paying back the loan of their fellow group member if she is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is \"Leonila L.\u2019 Group\".\r\n\r\nTo make a living, Leonila owns and operates a retail store where she sells both daily-use products and ready-to-wear clothes in the local community. She has been engaged in this business for six years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn July 2009, she joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 14,900 PHP from PMPC. She is now requesting a loan of 14,900 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory. This will be the fourth loan taken out by Leonila from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the living standard of her family. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout Group Loans\r\nIn a group loan, each member of the group receives an individual loan but is part of a group of individuals bound by a group guarantee. Under this arrangement, each member of the group supports one another and is responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":730084,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"

During the 56 years, her life was successful and intensive. This woman\u2019s life has many facets: she is a mother of five, a schoolteacher with many years of experience, and an experienced agricultural worker. All her children, aside from the youngest 24-year old son, have left the nest long time ago and now fly on their own. The youngest son together with his father, who works at the local tax collection agency of their town, take an active part in caring for the livestock.

The happily married father of three is a stickler for diligence and he cites it as the overriding factor as to why he has been able to make significant strides over the course of the last few years. He became involved in this business when he sensed the ready market for staple foods such as Irish potatoes, bananas, cassava, maize, beans, rice, etc in his home area. Before that, William worked in a timber sales business. By his own account, profits from this business enabled him to take root in his current business.

Recently, our client divorced and was left with three daughters to raise.  She has worked for many years in field of medicine and devoted all this time to working in a hospital.  Cholpon had to leave her work since her newborn baby requires constant care.  She spent her savings and salary (10,000 som) to buy three head of livestock.  Cholpon has begun to master a new trade: raising livestock.  After only one year of experience, Cholpon has not had trouble becoming accustomed to her new business.  She has a stable monthly income of 5,000 som. Cholpon explains that there is a steadily-growing demand for livestock production in that region and in the whole world. Cholpon wants to provide the best possible conditions for her daughters.  She is taking out a loan to purchase furniture for their house. This year, her oldest daughter is preparing to enter the university, and Cholpon hopes to provide her a solid foundation.  \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":733240,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy furniture","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Toktogul","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":135,"posted_date":"2011-03-22T12:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cholpon","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"\u0416\u044b\u043b\u0434\u044b\u0437\u043a\u0430\u043d","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"\u041d\u0430\u0441\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0442","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":15000,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2232},{"due_date":"2011-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2363},{"due_date":"2011-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2444},{"due_date":"2011-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2534},{"due_date":"2011-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2658},{"due_date":"2011-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2769}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.36},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.2},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.95},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.91},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.59},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.99}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":48.36,"local_amount":2232,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:30:38Z","rounded_local_amount":2294.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206192751,"comment":null},{"amount":51.2,"local_amount":2363,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-17T08:03:48Z","rounded_local_amount":2429.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211571555,"comment":null},{"amount":52.95,"local_amount":2444,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:30:21Z","rounded_local_amount":2512.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216546215,"comment":null},{"amount":172.49,"local_amount":7961,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:11:25Z","rounded_local_amount":8185.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221714811,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-03-22T14:04:01Z","paid_date":"2011-08-15T09:11:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":282771,"name":"Saruul","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Saruul, 48, is married and lives with her husband and two children in Bayanhongor province of Mongolia.

Unlike many of her peers she always knew exactly what she wants to do in life. When she chose her profession Sypaada was not driven by prestige or the demand of the profession, but rather by what she had a real aptitude for and what gave her gratification. She became a hairdresser.\r\n\r\nWhen she was seventeen Sypaada finished a school of image making and hairdressing. Two years of working with experienced specialists in the country's capital helped her when she moved back to her home town of Toktogul to share her skills with her colleagues. Daily long hour shifts have increased her clientele base. Thus the monthly income for Sypaada is now 10000 soms. With more services offered in her salon there are more expenses. Most expenses include equipment, instruments and supplies. Sypaada plans to spend this loan mainly on buying additional instruments for the salon. Her biggest dream is to open her own beauty salon with highest quality service.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":733251,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","use":"to buy supplies for the hairdressing salon","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Toktogul","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":135,"posted_date":"2011-03-17T21:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":850,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sypaada","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"\u0410\u0437\u0438\u0437\u0431\u0435\u043a","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"\u0414\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0440\u0430\u043c","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":40000,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":4248},{"due_date":"2011-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":4535},{"due_date":"2011-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":4677},{"due_date":"2011-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":4837},{"due_date":"2011-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":5111},{"due_date":"2011-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":5320},{"due_date":"2011-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":5506},{"due_date":"2011-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":5766}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.27},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.37},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.39},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.78},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.61},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.05},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":117},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":122.53}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":90.27,"local_amount":4248,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:30:51Z","rounded_local_amount":4283.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206192752,"comment":null},{"amount":96.37,"local_amount":4535,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-17T08:04:02Z","rounded_local_amount":4573.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211571556,"comment":null},{"amount":663.36,"local_amount":31217,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:30:34Z","rounded_local_amount":31480.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216546216,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-03-18T02:49:57Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T11:30:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":282778,"name":"Hussain","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hussain is a 25 year-old married man, living in Chtaoura with his wife and child.

In the past four years the prices for fodder have almost tripled.\r\n\r\nGulnar N. is 56 years old, a leader of this group. She also fell victim to these economic events. Twelve years ago her starting capital was 12000 soms when she bought two calves. For the entire decade the resale of the cattle was stable. However in the past years the hike in prices on hay due to the weather conditions and water shortages made the situation for animal husbandry workers difficult.\r\n\r\nGulnar and her group are very grateful to Kiva for the loan. It is significantly helping her and other members of the group to alleviate themselves from the difficult financial situation. Gulnar has defined he purpose of this loan as for purchase of another calf to increase headcount of cattle.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":733258,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is married, and has 4 children aged 31, 29, 24 and 20. She has 5 additional dependents who live with her because they are her nieces and nephews.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Juliet established her drug store business. She began her business because she wanted to help with medications and to get more income. Working 6 days a week and 9 hours a day, she earns about Le 829,000 every month from this business.

In addition to his own cows\u2019 production, he collects dairy products from other villagers as well and sells them in Tbilisi. For transportation of the dairy products he uses his own car. \r\n\r\nWith the requested loan amount he plans to renovate his car. As a result of the renovation, the expenses on the car fuel will decrease significantly and will cause a 10% increase in the family\u2019s profit. \r\n\r\nWith the accumulated increased profit, George plans to purchase additional an milk cow for further expansion of the family's small farm.

She makes her home here in a simple structure with two children and her long term partner. She plans to continue enjoying being at home with her children and doing business.\r\n\r\nMargarita is excited to be taking her third loan with Esperanza. She has had her business for one and a half years, starting out with some savings she had accumulated. In less than 4 months, she joined this group for a loan to increase her sales. Margarita plans to use this loan to invest in her business by purchasing chains, bracelets, rings, earrings and plastic jewels. She will use the profits to invest in her business. She would like to have an improved business and to travel to different countries.\r\n\r\nThis Esperanza associate began with us because she wanted to expand her business and needed the capital to increase her sales.

live in the city of La Romana, where the economy depends on the sugar industry and on luxury tourism. It is becoming one of the most exclusive destinations in the Dominican Republic. There is a scarcity of potable water and of electricity, and there is a population of people from the Dominican Republic and Haitian immigrants. Their principle activity is new clothing sales.\r\n\r\nPatria is a single mom with three children. Her most difficult challenge has been to work for her children, in a different country with a different culture. She really enjoys working, and she doesn\u00b4t know what is to be lazy at home. Unless she is sick, she needs to be doing something, selling or doing household activities.\r\n\r\nPatria is very excited to receive her first loan from Esperanza International. She has had her business for about 10 years, when she began selling miscellaneous products. She is planning to invest her loan in the purchase of new clothes, especially spring and summer clothing. Easter is close and the weather is very warm; people are waiting to go to the beach and use light clothing. She plans to use her earnings to reinvest in her business and to provide all they need as a family. Thank you so much for supporting this group.

She is a very kind and hard-working young mother who lives in a rental house together with her husband, 25 year-old Roy, and her beloved daughter, 2 year-old Tatiana, who she would like to provide with a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nLizzeth sells her beauty products by visiting her customers in their own homes.  She is a very persistent and persuasive saleswoman which means that she finishes her cosmetics sales quickly.  She is very well-known in her village and people know that the products she sells are very good quality.  What she most enjoys about her work is advising her customers on the benefits of each product for their skin type.  She has been in this business for 1 year and she considers the most difficult part of her work to be collecting payment since her customers don't always have the money to pay her.  However, she is patient and tries to make sure that her customers pay off their debts.

She opens her doors at 6.00am, ready to receive her early-morning customers who are aware of the variety of merchandise that she has in her store and do not hesitate to buy from her.  They can be sure that they will find what they need.  What Nidia most enjoys about her work is chatting to her customers and finding out what is happening in her village.  She has been in this business for 2 years and she considers the most difficult part of her work to be staying in her store all day without being able to go out.

T. is from Barranquilla.  She has three children aged 10, 12 and 23.  Her main business for the past 15 years has been making garments, costumes and casual clothes, especially for women.  She also makes other income because she has a sales location where, in addition to the clothes she makes, she also sells a variety of other products and offers a photocopying service.\r\n\r\nMartha sells her products through two commercial consultants and directly to companies and universities in the city.  She also sells her products from her sales location to passersby.  Martha started her business after having followed a course in dressmaking where she learned all the techniques necessary for designing, preparing, assembling and putting the finishing touches to women's dresses.  She developed her experience as she worked on other dressmaking projects.  When she was ready, she started her own entrepreneurial adventure.  She bought her first fixed assets and supplies and, for 12 years, she worked out of an apartment, in a small workshop.  However, her first business challenge was that customers didn't come to her workplace so she rented premises and moved her workshop.  She started to obtain the results she hoped for both in terms of sales volume and in number of customers.\r\n\r\nThis is Martha's second loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and her first through Kiva.  She plans to use it to buy raw materials and supplies such as fabric, zippers and threads for making seasonal clothes such as school uniforms.  She will also stock her display cabinet with stationery and other products, taking advantage of the fact that her business is located in an area surrounded by students and teachers.  With her first loan, Martha managed to increase her working capital and improve her family income.  She is working on realizing her dream of increasing her production capacity, increasing her income and helping her children to become professionals so that they can have better opportunities in

The business is her main source of income, and her customers are the owners of food sales operations in the universities, fruit stands, and in general wherever fast foods are sold. \r\n\r\nShe began this business because she worked for 10 years in a microenterprise selling yuca for food use, and its owner did not want to continue with the business, so it was passed on to Claudia. In this way she began selling yuca in bulk, and over time a new opportunity presented it to her through her current clients, who proposed the idea of processing the product and turning it into a paste, so that their work would be easier. Claudia improved her initial enterprise with good results, and today her business is a large processor of this product. \r\n\r\nSince Claudia is a woman who is constantly active, she also works in her free time making clothing, because she likes this work and it generates additional income for her. This is her 11th loan and her first through Kiva, and she will use it to buy yuca to be processed, in order to serve new customers who are interested in buying the paste, since using it allows them to save time and to make their cooking process more flexible. Currently, her sales are stable, because throughout the year, cafeterias, restaurants and fast food businesses make daily orders, since they use this product as a foundation to prepare foods coated in a yuca dough, yuca-based biscuits and cakes, and other items. \r\n\r\nWith her previous loans through the Foundation, she has been able to generate profits to help her family and acquire a house of her own while also expanding her business. Now, her dream is to concentrate on buying a piece of commercial property in the future which is strategically located to allow her to deliver her products efficiently. Also, on the family level, she would like to see her children work in companies and be very successful. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":521.93,"image":{"id":733657,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy yuca for processing in order to serve new customers ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-03-20T14:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Claudia Patricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1070000,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":80154},{"due_date":"2011-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":81690},{"due_date":"2011-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":83256},{"due_date":"2011-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":84851},{"due_date":"2011-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":86478},{"due_date":"2011-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":88135},{"due_date":"2011-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":89824},{"due_date":"2011-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":91546},{"due_date":"2011-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":93301},{"due_date":"2012-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":95089},{"due_date":"2012-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":96912},{"due_date":"2012-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":98764}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.07},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.9},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.74},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.6},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.47},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.36},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.27},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.2},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.14},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.1},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.07}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":43.07,"local_amount":80154,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:04:10Z","rounded_local_amount":81322.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206157483,"comment":null},{"amount":43.9,"local_amount":81690,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:17:51Z","rounded_local_amount":82880.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211230497,"comment":null},{"amount":44.74,"local_amount":83256,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:09:03Z","rounded_local_amount":84469.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216509349,"comment":null},{"amount":45.6,"local_amount":84851,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:50:28Z","rounded_local_amount":86088.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221673571,"comment":null},{"amount":46.47,"local_amount":86478,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:01:11Z","rounded_local_amount":87738.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227320128,"comment":null},{"amount":47.36,"local_amount":88135,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:05:34Z","rounded_local_amount":89419.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232803264,"comment":null},{"amount":48.27,"local_amount":89824,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:17:57Z","rounded_local_amount":91133.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238614349,"comment":null},{"amount":49.2,"local_amount":91546,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:59:34Z","rounded_local_amount":92880.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244568321,"comment":null},{"amount":50.14,"local_amount":93301,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:06:31Z","rounded_local_amount":94661.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250779667,"comment":null},{"amount":51.1,"local_amount":95089,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:19:44Z","rounded_local_amount":96475.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257188085,"comment":null},{"amount":52.08,"local_amount":96912,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:34:44Z","rounded_local_amount":98324.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263324324,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-03-20T18:22:00Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":283027,"name":"Giovana Esmeralda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La socia pertenece al banco comunal\u201d EL AMANECER\u201d;

After moving to the United States in 1998, Rocio knew that opening her own business was a natural choice. \u201cAll of my family does this job. It\u2019s what I know and what I learned. When I first came here it was really hard to find a job; instead, I went into business for myself and began selling crafts on the street in downtown San Francisco,\u201d said Rocio. \r\n\r\nRocio and her husband Alejandro now own a small store, Inkza Crafts, in San Francisco\u2019s Mission District, and also sell their goods at festivals around the Bay Area. Rocio handles the store\u2019s marketing, customer relations, and inventory while Alejandro manages the accounting and administrative aspects of the business. \r\n\r\nHer favorite part about owning a small business, Rocio explained, is being a part of her community. \u201cEach day I am able to meet and make connections with the people around me. I feel free.\u201d As their own bosses, Rocio and Alejandro are able to spend more time with their children. \u201cOur kids can be part of our work. They come to fairs with us and enjoy the food and all the people.\u201d \r\n\r\nOne quarter of the merchandise found in Inkza Crafts is designed by Rocio herself, while the remaining inventory is made by indigenous artists throughout Latin America. The store\u2019s success since opening in 2003 has allowed Rocio to work more on her own designs, and she recently has started to sell her products wholesale. A few stores around the Bay Area now sell her jewelry and crafts, and she is excited to increase that number over the next year. \r\n\r\nRocio and Alejandro first came to Opportunity Fund in 2007 and, using two successive micro loans, were able to build up their inventory and expand their business. Unfortunately, their store was damaged and items were stolen during a recent break-in. A $3,000 micro loan will help them to replace this lost inventory. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3000,"image":{"id":731200,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Jewelry","sector":"Retail","use":"to replace inventory after a robbery","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"US","country":"United States","town":"San Francisco, CA","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39.76 -98.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":132,"posted_date":"2011-03-18T22:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rocio","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-02-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":3000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":308.31},{"due_date":"2011-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":328.93},{"due_date":"2011-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":330.58},{"due_date":"2011-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":333.29},{"due_date":"2011-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":335.11},{"due_date":"2011-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":337.39},{"due_date":"2011-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":339.92},{"due_date":"2011-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":342.01},{"due_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":344.46}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":308.31},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":328.93},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":330.58},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333.29},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":335.11},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":337.39},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":339.92},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":342.01},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":344.46}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":308.31,"local_amount":308.31,"processed_date":"2011-04-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-19T07:58:37Z","rounded_local_amount":308.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206209514,"comment":null},{"amount":328.93,"local_amount":328.93,"processed_date":"2011-05-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:48:03Z","rounded_local_amount":328.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211284827,"comment":null},{"amount":330.58,"local_amount":330.58,"processed_date":"2011-06-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-25T08:00:28Z","rounded_local_amount":330.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":217381939,"comment":null},{"amount":333.29,"local_amount":333.29,"processed_date":"2011-07-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-18T07:52:18Z","rounded_local_amount":333.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221734789,"comment":null},{"amount":335.11,"local_amount":335.11,"processed_date":"2011-08-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-27T08:21:15Z","rounded_local_amount":335.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227105069,"comment":null},{"amount":337.39,"local_amount":337.39,"processed_date":"2011-09-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-20T08:12:06Z","rounded_local_amount":337.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232866402,"comment":null},{"amount":339.92,"local_amount":339.92,"processed_date":"2011-10-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-18T09:49:04Z","rounded_local_amount":339.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238682474,"comment":null},{"amount":342.01,"local_amount":342.01,"processed_date":"2011-11-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:54:52Z","rounded_local_amount":342.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244637962,"comment":null},{"amount":344.46,"local_amount":344.46,"processed_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-19T09:09:31Z","rounded_local_amount":344.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250854382,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-03-21T21:02:54Z","paid_date":"2012-01-19T09:09:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":283035,"name":"Delia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La socia pertenece al banco comunal\u201dSACSAYHUAMAN\u201d; El banco est\u00e1 ubicado en el distrito de Cusco,  perteneciente a la provincia de Cusco y departamento de Cusco.\n\nLa socia es la Sra.
