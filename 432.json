Her store is open all day for the customers' convenience, and it offers a wide range of products to satisfy buyers' needs.

L. is a married woman who lives in Barangay St.Martin, Carmen, Cebu. She earns her living by operating three business ventures: a general store, an auto shop and a computer games business. Her husband, William L., who is 47 years old, works in an auto shop to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have five children who are between the ages of 10 mos. and 23 years old. \r\n\r\nCherelyn joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she wanted for something better for her family. With the help of her past three loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Cherelyn has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. \r\n\r\nHer previous loan of 9,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of $420, raising the family's standard of living. This time, for her 4th cycle loan, she is borrowing 14,000 PHP, which she intends to use as additional working capital for improving and expanding her general store (sari-sari shop) and her computer gaming business so that she can continue to save up for a brighter future and for the education of her children. Cherelyn L. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling gold dust in the local community. Resty has been engaged in his business for over 2 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Resty joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Resty has successfully repaid a previous loan of 13000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to invest in renovating their house. Resty is requesting a new loan of 16000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. This loan will be the 5th loan taken out by Resty from HSPFI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

She has three children \u2013 two sons, one of whom is a student, and a school-aged daughter. Kulsada has a higher pedagogical education, and during the last 20 years she has been working as a teacher of Kyrgyz language and literature in a local school. She is known as a purposeful, positive and sociable person. She likes to work with children and help them to be educated people, which is crucial in the formation of their personalities. Kulsada\u2019s husband is engaged in farming.\nUnfortunately, a teacher's salary in rural areas is very low. That is why in 1995, Kulsada began to engage in stock-breeding using the 10,000 Kyrgyz Soms that she had put aside for a rainy day. At that time, she had only two calves. Gaining experience in cattle breeding, Kulsada broadened her business and today owns three milk cows, three horses and 27 sheep. She also began to cultivate a plot of land. \nKulsada is a really hardworking woman. Her striving to provide her children with a better life motivated her to apply for a loan of 50,000 Kyrgyz Soms for cattle breeding last year. Using the revenues from this loan, Kulsada was able to buy a car for the family. Now, she has decided to apply for a second loan of 80,000 Kyrgyz Soms. She will use it to buy 28 sheep.\nIn the future, Kulsada plans to build a house for her older son and to pay for a good education for the younger one. \n\nKiva's field partner Bai-Tushum and Partners uses Kiva funding to target the especially vulnerable population.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Pineapple 2.\r\n\r\nEvelyn is married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Evelyn runs a store selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap and toothpaste. She has been engaged in her business for over 12 years and earns approximately 8000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Evelyn joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She is requesting a loan of 4000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Evelyn from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

works very hard, having been a farmer since childhood. Today, as a head of household, he works tirelessly to generate a stable income. He works caring for his animals, getting up very early to gather grasses so he can keep his livestock well-fed. At the same time he has a grocery store near his house. Shuhrat sells the milk they produce, as well as grocery products for his community.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

O. is in the livestock business. He breeds livestock, which provides sustenance for his humble home. Yahyojon is a young married man and has one child. It is important to note that since he started his business, he has acquired an abundance of experience due to his great dedication and the knowledge he has acquired breeding his animals. The reason why Yahyojon looks for support from IMON International is that he needs to purchase livestock so he may sell it and in that way, continue with his arduous work with cattle in his sector.  \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Her previous loan of 25,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of 12,000 PHP, bettering the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her sixth cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 25,000, which she intends to use as additional capital to purchase another computer so that she can continue to save up for the future of her children. Evelyn J. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

He is domiciled in Banconi\u2013Koulikoro with his two wives and his children in a district of Sikasso City.  After having run many businesses without success, he got started in the business of storing and marketing grains (corn, millet, and sorghum) seven years ago.  He has a store in Kabo\u00efla I, opposite the Guinso Clinic. \r\n\r\nConcerned about further satisfying his burgeoning customer base, he decided to join the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso in 2009.  He has had an initial loan, which was properly repaid.  He is requesting a second loan to buy 28 sacks of corn, and 30 sacks of millet from towns surrounding Sikasso.  These goods are first stocked up in his store and are then resold in bulk to a customer base composed of retailers and heads-of-household.  \r\n\r\nWith this loan, he envisions making a monthly profit of 180,000 francs CFA.  The profits will be used essentially for helping to cover family expenses and to pay the loan interest.  The rest will be invested in his business.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":572195,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","use":"Buying grains ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abdramane ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":300000,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2010-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2010-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2010-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2011-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2011-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":37500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":216709,"name":"Ploak","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ploak S., 37, is married and resides with her husband and two children in Siem Reap Province, Cambodia, an area known as the most favorite tourist place in the country.

Not having had a chance to go to school and having tried various lines of business without success, some 26 years ago he has launched a business trading electronic appliances (radios, tape recorders, satellite dishes, batteries,  dish antennas, cellular phones and other miscellaneous items). Now he has plenty of experience, enjoys a good reputation in the business and receives many orders.\r\n\r\nAnd thus he is seeking a fourth loan, which will allow him to purchase 10 radio sets of various brands, 15  cellular phones and accessories, 4 satellite dishes, 3 armor-plated batteries, 7  dish antennas and 100 tapes in order to satisfy continuously growing customer demand. He stocks up in Bamako and sells his wares in his store located very centrally in a bus station in Sikasso, next to the K\u00e8n\u00e8dougou Voyage travel agency. He sells for cash as well as in credit. With this loan, he plans to achieve a monthly income of 270,000 West African Francs. He plans to use the income to cover family expenses, pay the interest on his loan and reinvest the rest in his business. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ekaterina Sukhanova, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":572202,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Electronics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchasing various electronics [for resale]","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Salif ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2011-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2011-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":62500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":216713,"name":"Isaac","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Isaac has been operating his mixed farm in Kitale town in Western Kenya for 10 years.

The 46 year old married mother of 6 school going children sweats her guts out selling agro produce like maize, sorghum, millet, beans, peas, ground nuts in a small rural area of Bisheshe, Ibanda. She has been doing this business for the last 6 years, which she started with her little capital from banana sales. She gets many customers who buy her products for food consumption.\r\n\r\nShe is able to make 80,000 Ugandan shillings monthly.

He lives with his family in a large traditional extended family in Mancourani I, the city center of Sikasso (third administrative region of the Republic of Mali).  After working for several years as a driver,  he decided four years ago to return to blacksmithing, the family trade. He pays in cash and often by credit for scrap iron to make various objects (ploughs, drills, carts, axes, cooking pots, etc.) which are sold in the weekly markets of Sikasso\u2019s surrounding areas (N\u2019Tchongobougou, Kadiolo, and H\u00e9r\u00e9makono). He is much sought after and the orders from his clients keep growing. In order to satisify this ever-growing clientele, he decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso microfinance institution.  This is his first loan request which will enable him to buy a ton of scrap iron.  With this loan, he expects to earn an average monthly profit of 150,000 CFA which will be used principally to increase his working capital, contribute to the family\u2019s expenses and pay the interest on his loan.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Connie Archea, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":572212,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Blacksmith","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"To buy scrap iron","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Daouda ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":300000,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2010-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2010-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2010-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2011-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2011-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":37500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":216723,"name":"Muth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Muth C., 22, is married and lives with her husband and a child in Siem Reap Province, Cambodia, an area known as the most favorite tourist place in the country.

She lives with her husband and her four children in Banconi, a neighborhood on the outskirts of the city of Sikasso (in the Third Adminstrative District of the Republic of Mali),\r\n\r\nMrs. S. started her business of warehousing and selling grains (ma\u00efze, millet, sorghum, etc.) after she unsuccessfully tried a number of other businesses.  She has been running her current business for more than seven years.  Her store is in Kabo\u00efla, across from the West African Bank (B.O.A.).  In order to better satisfy the needs of her ever growing client base, she decided to join Soro Yiriwaso micro-finance about six years ago.  She has participated in five group loans with a neighborhood women's group (the Kotognogontala Association of Banconi), and is now on her sixth individual loan; all the previous loans have been repaid on time.  \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Mrs. S. plans to buy 23 bags of ma\u00efze, 10 bags of sorghum and 11 bags of millet.  She buys her stock in the outskirts of Sikasso before re-selling it at discount wholesale or retail prices to clients who are usually heads of households.  She hopes to earn 200,000 francs per month in income that will be used to finance her business, contribute to the family's expenses and pay interest on the loan.  \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Eileen Jessop, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":572215,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","use":"To buy grains","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Salimata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2011-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2011-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":62500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":216726,"name":"Mrs. Nhar Ith Village Bank Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This village bank loan has eighteen people who live in Prey Kduoch village in Takeo province.

With this first individual loan, she plans to purchase one can of vegetable oil, three packs of Maggie cubes, one bag of onions, three bags of mustard etc.\r\n\r\nShe stocks up at the big market of Sikasso and later retails the goods for cash or on credit.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, she plans to achieve monthly revenue of 80,000 West African Francs, which will essentially be used towards covering family expenses and paying the interest on her loan, with the remainder reinvested in  the business.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ekaterina Sukhanova, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":572219,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"Purchasing food condiments","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatoumata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":150000,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-11-06T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2011-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:58:23Z","rounded_local_amount":25430.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166913696,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:41:19Z","rounded_local_amount":25430.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172180827,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:37Z","rounded_local_amount":25430.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177476797,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:39:52Z","rounded_local_amount":25430.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182613507,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:43:12Z","rounded_local_amount":25430.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188751939,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2011-01-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-17T00:56:47Z","rounded_local_amount":25430.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191606189,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-08-01T17:41:26Z","paid_date":"2011-02-17T00:56:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":216730,"name":"Michael","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Michael is 68 years old and is a farmer from the town of Murang'a in Central Province, Kenya.

She lives with her husband and their six children in the Pelengana S\u00e9b\u00e9nikoro district of S\u00e9gou (the third administrative region of Mali). She did not have an opportunity to go to school as her parents, who saw school as the road to perdition for girls, had refused to allow it. Therefore she started working and earning an income early on. She tried different types of activities, such as selling beignets, shoes, millet and grilled peanuts. Finally, she settled on this last line of business (selling millet and grilled peanuts), which she has been engaged in for about 12 years, at the  Ch\u00e2teau de Segou market as well as other local markets (the Monday market in S\u00e9gou and the Thursday market of Banankoro).\r\n\r\nIn order to grill peanuts , she puts them in a large heavy skillet over fire. From time to time she stirs peanuts with a ladle; this repetitive process can take a while\r\n\r\nWith the goal of strengthening her business, she turned to Soro Yiriwaso. She has been a member for 56 months. After four solidarity loans and four individual loans, all duly repaid, she is now on her fifth individual loan, which she plans to use for purchasing 18 bags of peanuts and 12 bags of millet. She stocks up on peanuts in S\u00e9gou and on millet in Banankoro.\r\n\r\nMrs. Dj\u00e9n\u00e9ba S. sells for cash to a customer base composed of both men and women.\r\nShe plans to earn a monthly revenue of 70,000 West African Francs, which will allow her to meet some family expenses and  participate in social events such as weddings, baptisms and funerals. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ekaterina Sukhanova, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":572224,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"Purchasing peanuts and millet","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Segou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14 -6","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dj\u00e9n\u00e9ba  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":400000,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":36363.64},{"due_date":"2010-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":36363.64},{"due_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":36363.64},{"due_date":"2010-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":36363.64},{"due_date":"2011-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":36363.64},{"due_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":36363.64},{"due_date":"2011-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":36363.64},{"due_date":"2011-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":36363.64},{"due_date":"2011-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":36363.64},{"due_date":"2011-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":36363.64},{"due_date":"2011-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":36363.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.73},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.72},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.73},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.73},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.73},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.72},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.73},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.73},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.73},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.72},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.73}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":216736,"name":"Cheuy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Cheuy C., 26, is married and lives with her husband and two children in Siem Reap Province, Cambodia, an area known to be the favorite tourist place in the country.\r\n\r\nC. produces traditional cake, earning an income of USD 3 per day.

Laurent is married to Appoline ABLESSI, a dressmaker, and is the father of three children, some of whom attend school. Laurent lives together with his family and provides for their various expenses, thanks to the income he obtains from his business. Laurent is a dressmaker with a workshop in his home. He would like to make a large number of shirts to sell and to increase his sales. Given the few financial resources at his disposal, Laurent is requesting a first loan from ALID\u00e9, which will enable him to reach his goal. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Connie Archea, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":572249,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"To buy a sewing machine and fabric for shirts.

C. is from the town of Surallah. She is 62 years old, married and has seven children. While most of her children are adults, she still has her younger ones who go to school and hope to finish college someday. Dionisia owns and operates a business raising livestock. The main source of income for the business comes from raising pigs for fattening and sale. She also raises ducks. Dionisia has been engaged in her business for over 25 years.\r\n\r\nDionisia joined CEVI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to do business. Dionisia has successfully repaid a previous loan from CEVI. Dionisia is requesting a new loan of 8,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise & sell. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Dionisia from CEVI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout CEVI:\r\n\r\nCommunity Economic Ventures, Inc (CEVI) has increased its portfolio significantly over the recent years.

The upshot has been that he has been able to reliably provide for his family of 4 school-going children, plus his wife. With this loan, Muhamadi wants to buy more shoes for reselling.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He was encouraged to become a GHAPE member in 2007 as he was finding it too difficult to take care of his family and he was looking for business capital. Also, he has been having a lot of marital problems with his wife. This has made him feel sad all the time but he is appreciative of the fact that he is alive. His desire is to give his children love and education. He states that he feels better each time he provides something for his children.\r\n\r\nSince 2007, he has taken and repaid two loans and has proven himself to be very hardworking. His inability to get investment capital, which could constantly generate income for him to meet his children\u2019s needs, is what motivated him to obtain a loan from GHAPE.\r\n\r\nGiven a loan, he plans to buy palm nuts, groundnuts and farm tools for sale. These articles are in high demand in his area. He knows this business will succeed because he is located at a good business site. He plans to use the profits generated to sponsor his children in school and to cater for the basic needs of his family. \r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instils a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

D. lives in Chimkent village in the north of Kyrgyzstan. She is 56 years old, married and has 7 children. One of them is of school age and the others are grown up. After graduating from Trade College in the capital city, Shabirkul worked in the trade sector for many years. Her colleagues characterized her as a very diligent and responsible person.   \r\n\r\nAfter the breakdown of the Soviet Union, Shabirkul and her family started their own business of cultivating kidney beans, wheat and potatoes. Using the small amount of 3,000 Kyrgyz soms to purchase and plant seeds, Shabirkul and her family worked hard to get a good harvest. \r\n\r\nBeing a persistent person, Shabirkul organized a farmers\u2019 group named \u201cFruitful Land\u201d and applied for a group loan of 20,000 Kyrgyz soms. She bought a milk cow and fodder for her cattle. After that, Shabirkul applied for an individual loan of another 20,000 Kyrgyz Soms, which she used to cultivate beans and potatoes. Shabirkul used her loans as intended and repaid them without any delays. \r\n\r\nAll these activities allowed Shabirkul to give a good dowry to her daughter, hold her son\u2019s wedding and renovate her house. In 2009, life put Shabirkul through a severe test: her husband had a stroke and died. However, Shabirkul braced herself to make her children\u2019s life stable.  \r\n\r\nShabirkul is applying for a loan of 25,000 Kyrgyz soms to purchase fertilizer to cultivate her plot of land with wheat, kidney beans and potatoes. With the revenues from the loan, she plans to broaden her business by purchasing cattle and building a barn.\r\n\r\nBai-Tushum and Partners uses Kiva funding to target the especially vulnerable population. Kiva borrowers benefit from a 5% discount on the interest rate if they pay back without delay.\r\n\r\nBai-Tushum and Partners is one of the leading Microfinance Institutions in Kyrgyzstan. As a reliable financial partner, Bai-Tushum contributes to the economic development of the Kyrgyz Republic through the delivery of microfinance services in rural and urban areas that lead to increased employment and meet the interests of its clients and investors.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":572307,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Chimkent","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2010-07-22T21:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shabirkul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":25000,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2011-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":220},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":330}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":220,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T01:43:33Z","rounded_local_amount":10354.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191378702,"comment":null},{"amount":330,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:22:34Z","rounded_local_amount":15531.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221622638,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-07-23T02:12:15Z","paid_date":"2011-08-15T08:22:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":216799,"name":"Henrik","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Henrik H. is 58 years old; he lives in Tsovaghugh village, Sevan area.

With your help Kholik can get ahead.   \n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Makhsud is 34 years old, married, and has three children. Makhsud has been a farmer since he was very young. He plants potatoes and other vegetables and also raises cattle at his house. Makhsud alternates the crops so that while one is growing the other is ready to be cleaned and prepared, until finally be begins to plant potatoes again. Growing potatoes is very profitable because there are certain seasons when prices are higher and farmers have the opportunity to increase their capital. Currently Makhsud needs funds for growing his crops and purchasing young cattle, and for that reason he applied to IMON International with the request of 13000 Somoni loan. He will spend this loan for buying seeds, fertilizer and young cattle. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Development Group-Mukono","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mukono Town, like any other metropolis in Uganda, is crawling with a commercial motorcycle craze, commonly known around the country as Boda Boda. Most people use this form of transportation to beat the gridlock traffic jams that are commonplace all over the country. One person who has developed an inclination towards this craze is 38 year old K. Wilson, a married man with 3 school-going children. It goes without saying that this business is lucrative and that is principally the reason why there are so many people joining this business. \r\n\r\nWilson like many of his friends has his stage at Ngandu Trading Center.

is a market entrepreneur from Kamenka. She sells groceries, tea, coffee and fruits in one of the local markets. Liana owns a small vending kiosk equipped with electricity and located in a good part of the marketplace. Liana started her business 10 years ago. Presently, she has 32,000 Grivnyas of turnover capital. Her net profit amounts to 5,000 Grivnyas a month. \r\n\r\nLiana is requesting a loan of 10,000 Grivnyas to purchase additional merchandise for her kiosk. She tries to offer only fresh produce for sale which has helped her gain good reputation among customers.

V\u00edctor is grateful to those individuals who will be approving his loan request because the money will be useful in helping him to make progress in his business.  The loan will go toward the purchase of wood for building new pens.  Part of the money will be used to have electricity installed into his home. This will allow him to have light on his farm because it is very dark at night, thereby making it difficult for him to feed the animals.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":572415,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase wood to build more guinea pig pens & pay to have electricity installed","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Victor ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":76.03},{"due_date":"2010-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":77.28},{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":80.87},{"due_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":85.05},{"due_date":"2010-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":88.32},{"due_date":"2010-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":92.45}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.41},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.91},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.35},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.02},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.33},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.98}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":61.32,"local_amount":153.31,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:40:07Z","rounded_local_amount":173.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166887432,"comment":null},{"amount":32.35,"local_amount":80.87,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:35Z","rounded_local_amount":91.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172154435,"comment":null},{"amount":34.02,"local_amount":85.05,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:14:16Z","rounded_local_amount":96.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449744,"comment":null},{"amount":35.33,"local_amount":88.32,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:00:53Z","rounded_local_amount":99.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588447,"comment":null},{"amount":36.98,"local_amount":92.45,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:03:28Z","rounded_local_amount":104.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188724950,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-08-02T01:23:47Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T14:03:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":216848,"name":"Jenet","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jenet A. is single and prepares locally-made drinks with bread to sell at Elmina.

The members chose the name thinking that they are capable of contributing to the development of their families.\r\n\r\nEach of them is involved in a different activity among which we can mention the following: raising small farm animals, basket weaving, the sale of daily use items, sale of typical costumes.\r\n\r\nShe will use the loan to buy animals so that she can generate more income because one of the limiting factors she has faced is the lack of capital.  However, they have gotten ahead and hope that their investment will grow and generate more income.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1900,"image":{"id":572432,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy pigs and sheep.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Totonicap\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":113,"posted_date":"2010-07-24T03:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1900,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rigoberta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Nohem\u00ed","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nicomedes Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Magdalena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Santos Felipa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Basilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eulalia Argueta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elsa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":15000,"loan_amount":1900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2010-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2010-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2010-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2010-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":316.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":316.66},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":316.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":316.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":316.66},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":316.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":316.67,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2010-08-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:41:55Z","rounded_local_amount":2530.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166802448,"comment":null},{"amount":316.66,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2010-09-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:44:43Z","rounded_local_amount":2530.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172072469,"comment":null},{"amount":316.67,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2010-10-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:04:55Z","rounded_local_amount":2530.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177363973,"comment":null},{"amount":316.67,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2010-11-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-14T09:19:35Z","rounded_local_amount":2530.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182499088,"comment":null},{"amount":316.66,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2010-12-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-10T09:34:20Z","rounded_local_amount":2530.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188634693,"comment":null},{"amount":316.67,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:12:25Z","rounded_local_amount":2530.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191377749,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-07-24T13:43:14Z","paid_date":"2011-03-24T08:12:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":216860,"name":"Milton Rene","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Se\u00f1or Rene vive en la casa de su Mama quien le ayuda en la crianza de sus animales, ya que el es soltero su mama le dijo que empiece un negocio y ahorre dinero para que pueda comprarse una casita ya que alg\u00fan d\u00eda te casaras cuenta el,  no sabia que hacer a que dedicarse y  empez\u00f3 a trabajar como ayudante de un cerrajero pero no ganaba lo suficiente es por ese motivo que empez\u00f3 a comprarse una vaquita y le fue bien cuando la vendi\u00f3 luego aumentando a eso compro dos ahora que subi\u00f3 no pudo comprar con lo que tenia es por ese motivo que se animo a sacar el  cr\u00e9dito y as\u00ed poder aumentar para comprarse una vaquita, viendo sus necesidades nosotros le dimos un cr\u00e9dito kiva y esta muy feliz por eso y muy agradecido por la oportunidad.\t\t","en":"\r\nRen\u00e9 lives in his mother\u2019s house.

She lives together with her daughter in her house which she was able to acquire thanks to a great deal of effort.  She works in food sales outside of her home.  In the beginning she used to sell toys and other items.  Cecilia is a very charismatic woman and she always has a lot of energy to work.  This is why she has many customers who always consider her.  She currently prepares hot chocolate; this dessert is in high demand in the current season.  In the future she wants a more stable business such as a store and to leave this business to her daughter, since she likes this type of work.

She is a very creative youth, because 10 years ago she started to make products from the material Porcelanicron (an air dry clay used in crafts), and she has learned many techniques to work with this material.  In addition, she also does liquid embroidery, and her products are very specialized.  She distributes her products through stores and  individuals.  Lately, she has also been teaching this beautiful art to many people, especially youths and housewives, so that more people can live as well as she does.  She named her plastic arts business \"Aurarte,\" where she makes different ornamental figures and she teaches methods for making handicrafts; in the class she teaches students how to prepare the Porcelanicron material, mold the dough, and make the decorative items, which transforms them into an artist with a lot of magic and imagination. \r\n\r\nSince the year 2008, when she received her first loan from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, her life has changed.  Now she has a store that is open to the public daily, and she has improved her income and strengthened her business.  Now she is applying for this loan that she will invest in raw materials for the production of handicrafts in Fomy (craft foam), Porcelanicron and wood.\r\n\r\nAura's dream is to have a big school where she could teach specialized handicrafts and various handicraft techniques, including liquid embroidery and working with Porcelanicron.  Although at time she has faced challenges, such as when she has left her products on consignment at small stores or with individuals and the products have been damaged and sometimes lost, this has been important experience for her because she has learned to be more cautious about her sales systems and is using more effective controls.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar,

Since then, this is the activity she\u2019s been in accompanied by her daughters which has helped her support her family.\r\n\r\nFemina has gotten 3 previous loans during three years from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  Her goal has always been to improve.  This is why she took pastry making courses at SENA (Servicio Nacional de Aprendizaje-National Learning Service) in order to some day having a large pastry shop, which is one of her goals.\r\n\r\nHer dream and challenge is that her two youngest daughters finish their university education so that they will be successful and attain a better quality of life.  Later on she hopes to have her own home because she\u2019s currently a renter.\r\n\r\nFemina is applying for a $1.500.000 COP loan to buy ingredients for her fast-food items, among them grilled meats, potatoes, flours and other ingredients.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva

Her method of work consists of visiting her friends and neighbors to sell these products.  Agueda\u2019s good taste for getting clothing has given her a great advantage with her customers and she is able to sell all of her merchandise quickly.

is a 56-year-old mother of five who lives in Puntarenas, located on the pacific coast of Costa Rica.

Her business is located in the center of Puntarenas; however, her business is not limited to this locale. Ena also has clients in Nicoya, Guanacaste, Playa Samara and Garza. She sells all types of clothes: for children, men, women, sports clothing, intimate clothing, casual and dress clothes. Ena knows her clients depend on her, which is why she has located her inventory and main selling point in a central location.\r\n\r\nEna plans to use this loan to finance the purchase of shirts both for men and children. She has a contact that has guaranteed her a good price. All she needs is an increase in working capital to take advantage of this favorable rate. At the moment, Ena has very low inventory levels, which is why this loan will help her to increase her supply.\r\n\r\nEna is a hardworking entrepreneur. She wakes up early at 4:30 AM to carry out the tasks of maintaining the household. At 7:00 AM she heads to Puntarenas, 10 Kilometers from her house, where she sets up her selling post in the center of the city. Ena works from 10 AM to 5 PM. After work, she heads to night classes where she is working towards the completion of primary school. \r\n\r\nEna has the goal of purchasing a car by the end of the year. She hopes to earn enough money to be able to financially support the studies of her grandchildren, as well as make home improvements. A major obstacle for Ena has been going through the application process for the necessary legal permits she needs in order to sell from her location in Puntarenas. As a result of her perseverance, she has been able to secure the permits, increase her income and the standard of living of her family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":572692,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To
