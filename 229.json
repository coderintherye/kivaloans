She is 34 years old. Meriam is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Meriam owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling seafood products including fish and shrimp in the local community.  They sell it thru peddling. Meriam and her husband peddle their fish using their motorcycle around the village. Meriam has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 2500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Meriam joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Meriam has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Meriam is requesting a new loan of 13000 PHP, which will be used for capital and partly as a down payment for a motorcycle. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Meriam from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to support education and improvement of the house. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

O. is from the city of Ramon Chavez, Cagayan de Oro. He is 48 years old. Elpedio is married and has two adult-aged children. To make a living, Elpedio owns and operates a business venture in the food sector, making and selling food. The main source of income for the business comes primarily from processing and selling pork products in the local community, particularly pork longganisa and tocino. Elpedio has been engaged in his business for over 10 years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month from this work.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2008, Elpedio joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services. He became a member in order to help improve his living situation and increase his ability to engage in business activities. Elpedio has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. \r\n<p>\r\nElpedio is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase the raw ingredients needed to make his food products for sale. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Elpedio from HSPFI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to support the education of his children. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n<p>\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

Wilma has been engaged in her business for over seven years, earning approximately 12000 PHP a month. <p>\r\n\t\r\nIn 2008, Wilma joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Having fully repaid a previous loan of 11000 PHP from HSPFI that was used to invest in expanding the business, Wilma is requesting a new loan of 14000 PHP to invest in further expansion of the business. This will be her fourth loan from HSPFI, and she plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to support the needs of her family.<p>\r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

Since it is the closest border town, many small Mongolian vendors import cheap products to Mongolia. She rents a small stall in Tsahiur shopping mall. Since the start in 2003, she has done quite well; her business capital has increased from 300,000 MNT to 750,000 MNT. In the future, she hopes to create saving accounts for her two children to ensure her children's future. She aims to put aside some of her profits for her children's savings.

R. is from the city of Pigsag-an, Cagayan de Oro. She is 31 years old. Helen is married and has 4 school-aged children. To make a living, Helen owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector operating a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap, and toothpaste in the local community. Helen has been engaged in her business for over 1 year and earns approximately 3000 PHP a month for these activities.<P>\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Helen joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Helen has successfully repaid a previous loan of 11,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Helen is requesting a new loan of 14,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the 4th loan taken out by Helen from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the income of the family. <P>\r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n<P>\r\nHSPFI is an accredited partner of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.<P>\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

H\u00f3a.  Quy\u00ean is the leader of a 4-member group which is accepting a loan offered by T. Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.  The official name of this borrowing group is 32 - Nam Ng\u1ea1n.\r\n\r\nQuy\u00ean is married and has 2 school-aged children.  To making a living, Quy\u00ean owns and operates a business venture in the service sector operating a service-based business.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from providing hairdressing & beauty services to local members of the community.  Quy\u00ean has run this business for over 10 years and earns approximately 1,500,000 Vietnamese dong (or about $84 US) a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Quy\u00ean joined T. Hoa Fund for Poor Women to gain access to financial services to help improve both her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities.

She began a business in 1984 with an initial capital of US$ 50. Between 1984 and 1990, the sale of fresh foodstuffs brought her up to a capital of US$ 100, which allowed her to diversify her business by adding on a general store. This also prospered from 1994 to 2000, at which point Chantal was in a traffic accident as she was out buying goods for her store. Her hospitalization of 4 months caused a noticeable diminishing of her business. <P>\r\n\r\nAfter her convalescence, in 2000, she decided to undertake a different type of business, selling beauty products for women. Since she had acquired so much experience in business management over the years, Chantal was able to accumulate a personal capital of US$ 500 by 2006, which allowed her to open a little factory for pure drinking water that she maintains up to today.<P>\r\n\r\nIn view of her  dream of one day opening a big factory making drinking water so as to serve the population of her neighborhood, which has great need of this product, she decided in December of 2007 to join one of the groups of Hope RDC called \u00ab R\u00e9hoboth Plus \u00bb with the goal of increasing her business's financial base. Chantal is a faithful client of Hope and has received several loans, reimbursing them completely and in a timely manner. <P>\r\n\r\nThe loan she has received in this month of June allowed her to buy 1000 packages of bags of pure water so as to satisfy the needs of her customers and thus increase her profit.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

En 1994, son activit\u00e9 a produit un montant de $300 qui lui ont permis  de s\u2019acheter un gros panier des poissons fum\u00e9s qu\u2019elle a revendu  \u00e0 Kinshasa.  De 1994 \u2013 2000, gr\u00e2ce aux b\u00e9n\u00e9fices accumul\u00e9s, elle a diversifi\u00e9 son affaire en y ajoutant des moustiquaires dont les gens avaient grandement besoin dans son milieu pour combattre la malaria.

","en":"Jos\u00e9phine got into the world of micro-enterprise at the age of 13 in 1985. Taught by her mother, she acquired a solid experience in selling fresh fish in  Mbandaka in the province of Equateur in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In 1994, her business had allowed her to accumulate US$ 300 which let her buy a big basket of smoked fish that she sold in Kinshasa. \r\n\r\nFrom 1994 to 2000, thanks to her accumulated profit, she diversified her business by adding the sale of mosquito nets, which were very necessary for people in her area to combat malaria. From 2001 to the present, Jos\u00e9phine took up the sale of fish, which she is better at. Difficulties in her household in 2006 led to a divorce from her husband and caused a drop in her business. \r\n\r\nJos\u00e9phine is very much encouraged by the loans she receives from Hope RDC. The loan she has obtained in the month of June allowed her to buy 2 baskets of smoked fish which she is selling in view of increasing the income from her business which generates US$ 30 in profit per week. \r\n\r\nHer ambition is to open a little shop and a maize and manioc depot. She has 6 children aged 3-21 of whom only 3 are enrolled in school. Jos\u00e9phine feels good about her business since she is the breadwinner for her family. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva

Several women in the neighborhood got together and decided to form a committee and it has gone well so far.  They don\u2019t have any late payments and have group savings of over $400.  They work to help pay their loan payments.  The women that participate in this committee sell their wares in their neighborhood as well as in the center of San Lorenzo.  \r\n\r\nDue to the economic crisis, several women changed payment plans in this cycle of the committee.  The average loan received by each woman is 530,434 PYG, which will be invested in the purchase of wares that will be sold in their respective commercial activities.  \r\n\r\n1\tYsidora G.\tDressmaker

Meanwhile, Eugenia and her husband work in their neighbours\u2019 small farms from 8am until 6pm for a daily wage of 12 soles (about 4 US dollars) for her and 15 soles (about 5 US dollars) for him. \r\n\r\nAlthough Eugenia and her husband work for their neighbours, they don\u2019t neglect their own plants. They delegate specific tasks to each of their children, so they can learn not only how to farm but also the value of money that is obtained through hard work. \r\n\r\nThis is her fifth loan with MFP. Over the last 3 years, she has gained the esteem, affection and respect of all the members of her communal bank, due to her responsibility and her wise opinions during group meetings. \r\n\r\nShe is now asking for money to buy chemical fertilizers to speed up the even ripening of the coffee beans, so she can get a better price for her future harvests.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Zev Lowe, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":332366,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy fertilizer (Compra de fertilizantes)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-06-10T03:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eugenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":332.52,"local_amount":950.06,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:28:55Z","rounded_local_amount":999.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641364,"comment":null},{"amount":17.48,"local_amount":49.94,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:06:28Z","rounded_local_amount":52.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110733896,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

However, because he likes working and loves his crops he continues working with the same faith with which he started. Currently Modesto has the desire to purchase of stand in the city so that his children can sell their products without the need for a middleman, which will allow them to increase their earnings. He is one of the founders of his communal bank for which he has much affection.  In the five loans that he has had with MFP he has shown himself to be a responsible man with a great sensibility to others problems. The money that he is requesting is to invest in a nursery for his coffee plants that he will in a few months take to plant on new plots of land. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mariela Cedeno, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":332376,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"A coffee plant nursery.

He has 3 children who all study, 1 of which is in secondary school. He leaves home 2 times a week, and has a permanent worker on his ranch that takes care of the daily chores. His wife has a small business in their home (a small grocery store). He is requesting his first loan to build a wall and porch that is of the up most urgency because with the rains, the water currents reach his porch and then flood his house. The wall will serve to expand the porch to which he will also add a roof; he will also add tubes and netting to the wall so he can enjoy the air that passes through. He has worked with cattle for 30 years, and began doing so with his dad when he was a small boy. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mariela Cedeno, Kiva

They have a daughter who is not yet old enough to attend school. Elvis also has a daughter from a previous marriage who lives with her mother and is in first year of high school.

He also provides accounting services to the Hoblan Bakery and Association Gogar for Seniors who pay him US$150.\r\nThis is his eighth loan, and he will use it to repair the floor in a room adjacent to the kitchen in his house. The floor measures 6m x 1.80m and was built using a previous loan, although not with Kiva. It is now in a dreadful condition; the uneven floor allows water from the patio to enter the house when it rains, so repair is urgently needed.\r\nElvis says that because of Kiva partner, AFODENIC, he

Within his home, he has a workshop where he builds doors, windows and different kinds of metallic structures upon request. In his free time, he also works as a motorcycle taxi driver. He considers his work as a locksmith quite profitable, since he has a number of regular customers who recommend him to their friends because of his high-quality workmanship. Alfredo's goal for the future is to build a new workshop in a better location that will be more appealing to his clients. This is his second loan from Microfinanzas Prisma.

Three are men and nine are women.  Mrs. Leonela is their representative.  They work in different areas.  Some of the men work in transportation and some are employees.  The women sell groceries in neighborhood stores, sell bread, clothing, soft drinks, food, and meat and chicken.  They work with the idea of getting ahead in mind and don\u2019t allow themselves to get overwhelmed by completion.  They need some economic support so they can strengthen their businesses.  This is why they need financing so they can buy materials, supplies, and\/or tools that will help generate better earnings so they can contribute to their family\u2019s quality of life.\r\n\r\nThe members of this group are new at this, so they don\u2019t have experience with solidarity groups, but they can count on the support of the group and of their responsibility to fulfill their family obligations.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Shelly Hubman, Kiva

","en":"Lino S. Z. is a 45-year-old man who has four children.  Two of them live on their own and two are with him.  He makes a living selling and buying pigs.  He also sells firewood from his home.  He began his work twelve years ago when he was living in a chaotic situation and his kids started needing things like, better nutrition.  Finding himself in this situation, he decided to begin collecting firewood and to go out and sell it in a small cart.  They were difficult times since the money was often spent on feeding his family, until his wife gave him the idea of raising pigs.  With her help, they have been able to get ahead by doing this.  Lino started earning more and began to ask for loans to buy another donkey, since the former one was very old and he was afraid that it would die soon and he wouldn\u2019t know what to do.  Mr. Lino would like to educate his children so they are not simple firewood salesmen and pig farmers like he is.  A father wants the best for his kids and this is why Lino is requesting a loan, believing he will receive it, since he needs to invest in buying wholesale pigs so he can get a better price.\r\n<br

Hern\u00e1ndez is 42 years old. She is married and has a 13-year-old son. Since she was very young, Juana Teodora has been hard working, and over the course of her life she has launched many businesses that weren't viable. Because of this, she decided to start a business selling fruits and vegetables, and even now it is bringing in money. At first she only sold lemons, but when she saw that her earnings were good, she decided to sell other types of fruit such as loquat, apples, bananas, watermelons, papayas, and other fruits known to the area.

since Mary was a young girl she has loved to sing. In 2005 she began studying music and eventually released a single in 2006. With a full length Gospel CD in 2007 her hobby turned into a business.  Mary writes and performs Christian Gospel Swahili music in South Boston where she has close ties to the African community. Mary sells her music through concerts as well as her website.\r\n\r\nMary has recently received a second loan from ACCION USA to finish producing a series of music videos.  She hopes to break into the large market in East Africa where videos, and not music albums, generate revenue and reach more listeners.  \r\n\r\nShe hopes to reach millions of Swahili speakers in countries like Kenya, Burundi, Tanzania and Uganda.  In addition, she recently noticed that there\u2019s a big market in the United States for her music, that goes beyond the African communities with whom she has close ties.  Mary says many people who buy her CD don\u2019t speak Swahili, \u201cbut they like the beat.\u201d  She currently performs all over Boston and has also performs at large community benefits and fundraisers.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2550,"image":{"id":332380,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Musical

B. is from the village of Garang, Tangub City. She is 43 years old. Crisanta is married and has four school-aged children. To make a living, Crisanta owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector, namely, running a \"sari-sari\" or general store. The main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling daily-use products such as shampoo, soap, and toothpaste in the local community. Crisanta has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 3,500 PHP a month from this work.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2009, Crisanta joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services. Her goal was to help improve her living situation and increase her ability to engage in business activities. Crisanta is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. \r\n<p>\r\nThis loan will be the first loan taken out by Crisanta from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n<p>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

In her shop she sells daily use products such as shampoo, soap & toothpaste in the local community. Riza has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 6000 PHP a month for these activities.\n\nIn 2008, Riza joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and to have the ability to engage in business activities. Riza has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Riza is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Riza from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve his general living conditions.\n\nAbout GDMPC:\n\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

A. is from the village of Maquilao Tangub City.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from fishing and fish selling. Marilou has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Marilou joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Marilou has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from GDMPC. Marilou is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to repair fishing net and invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Marilou from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business and to supplement family needs. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive co-operatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

B. is from the village of San Carlos, Tukuran, Zamboanga del Sur. She is 33 years old. Marivic is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Marivic owns & operates a food stall. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling vegetables & spices. Marivic has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 7,000 PHP (about 150 US dollars) a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Marivic joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Marivic has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional vegetables & spices. Marivic is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP which will also be used to purchase vegetables & spices. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Marivic from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family & children's education. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

E. is from the village of Balide, Aurora, Zamboanga del Sur. She is 57 years old. Erlinda is widowed and has 6 adult children. To make a living, Erlinda owns and operates a \"sari-sari\" or general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap, toothpaste, candies, etc. in the local community. Erlinda has been engaged in her business for over 9 years and earns approximately 5000 Philippine pesos (or about $105 US) a month for these activities.\n\nIn 2007, Erlinda joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve both her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Erlinda has successfully repaid a previous loan of 15000 pesos (or about $315 US) from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell in her general store. Erlinda is requesting a new loan of 10000 pesos (or about $210 US) which will be used to purchase new items to sell in her general store. This loan will be Erlinda's fourth loan from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \n\nAbout GDMPC:\n\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

Maribeth has been engaged in her business for over 7 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2009, Maribeth joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Maribeth is requesting a loan of 5000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Maribeth from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business and for her family's needs. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n<p>\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

I. is from the town of Lumbia, Cagayan De Oro City. She is 41 years old. Eva is married and has 4 school-aged children. To make a living, Eva owns and operates a trading business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from buying cashew nuts and processing them for sale to her established buyer. Eva has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 2,000 PHP a month from these activities.\n\nIn 2009, Eva joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Eva is requesting a loan of 5000 PHP, which will be used to purchase more cashew nuts to process and sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Eva from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income and provide for her family's needs. \n\nAbout HSPFI:\n\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She runs this business out of her home, but also offers house-calls for injections and wound care.\r\nShe received her first loan of 300 soles from the community bank Lideresas en Accion II, and invested that money in the purchase of products such as needles, alcohol and medicines.\r\nShe will invest this loan of 800 soles in the same products in order to restock her medicine chest.\r\nGladys' dream is to start a neighborhood pharmacy in order to grow as a small business woman. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Cyrus Maher, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":332747,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pharmacy","sector":"Health","use":"Purchase of needles, alcohol, medicines, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Trujillo - La Libertad","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.115994 -79.02998","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2009-06-10T16:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gladys Ruth ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":133.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":133.33,"processed_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:24:46Z","rounded_local_amount":137.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52985461,"comment":null},{"amount":45.95,"local_amount":133.67,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:16:39Z","rounded_local_amount":138.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63205876,"comment":null},{"amount":45.71,"local_amount":132.99,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T18:50:01Z","rounded_local_amount":137.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73635116,"comment":null},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":133.33,"processed_date":"2009-09-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T22:45:22Z","rounded_local_amount":137.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87074173,"comment":null},{"amount":45.95,"local_amount":133.68,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T02:16:04Z","rounded_local_amount":138.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96989587,"comment":null},{"amount":45.73,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:40:24Z","rounded_local_amount":137.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103834587,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-06-10T20:14:41Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T13:40:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":114411,"name":"Natama","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Natama S. is currently in the business of selling fruits like mangoes and bananas.

Bakhriddin is a gentleman who has dedicated himself to the business of farming and livestock for the past 3 years. He is married and has a daughter. Currently he is faced with the need to invest in the purchase of cattle. For this simple reason he is seeking the support of IMON International to obtain a loan for the purchase of cattle to sell. Bakhriddin is grateful to everyone supporting him.   \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Koko\u00e8 still lives in Aklakou with her family. As the breadwinner for 3 people, she has been selling staple goods and household products for six years. This activity permits her to cover the needs of her children. \r\n\r\nFor quite some time, she has been seeing her clientele grow, but because she lacks financial means, she is not capable of satisfying their demand. To respond to this situation, she is requesting a loan so that she can place more orders. This will allow her to satisfy the needs of her clientele, considerably improve her standard of living and that of her family, and reimburse her loan within 12 months. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":332803,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"sale of staple goods and household products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TG","country":"Togo","town":"An\u00e9ho","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"8 1.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":22,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Koko\u00e8","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":400000,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":28096.14},{"due_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":28517.58},{"due_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":28945.35},{"due_date":"2009-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":29379.53},{"due_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":29820.22},{"due_date":"2010-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":30267.52},{"due_date":"2010-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":30721.54},{"due_date":"2010-03-14T08:00:00Z","amount":31182.36},{"due_date":"2010-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":31650.09},{"due_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":32124.84},{"due_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":32606.72},{"due_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":33095.82},{"due_date":"2010-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":33592.29}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.46},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.38},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.32},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.27},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.23},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.21},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.2},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.21},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.23},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.27},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.4},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.49}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":114453,"name":"Karomatullo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Karomatullo H. is a married father of three children.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

J. is 42 years old, married and the father of four children.  Inomkul is an optimistic, hardworking man. He works his land with love and dedication every day, so it produces excellent vegetables. Inomkul has been in the  agri-business for more than 10 years. His loving wife is also engaged to the business. Though growing vegetables is a very difficult and time taking job, he hopes to gather a rich harvest.  \r\n<p>\r\nHe is planning to fix his house and save enough money for the well being of his family.  He requests a loan of $1250 USD.  Inomkul appeals to your generous heart for a swift contribution.   \r\n<p>\r\n--------------------------------------\r\nAbout Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Saifiddin is 25 years old, married, and has a little child. He is a villager in Istaravshan town in Northern Tajikistan.\r\n\r\nHe and his brother are farmers who own 0.8 hectares (2 acres) of land that they use to cultivate vegetables. On their plantation, they now face an obstacle because they do not have enough money to buy seeds and fertilizer. So, Saifiddin decided to ask for a loan for this purpose. Be an important part of the well-being of this young and noble family. \r\n\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Palmadera' (The Flowers of Palmadera) community bank belongs to the community of Palmadera, located in the Acoria district of Huancavelica province, in the department of Huancavelica. The majority of the population in this zone work in production and they organize themselves jointly to finance their work in Ayaccocha, Hucro and Huancavelica. The majority work in agriculture, livestock, and business.\r\n\r\nThe community bank consists of 17 partners who request loans between 200 and 800 PEN to use in their businesses; the sum of all loans is 7,100 PEN.\r\n\r\nLeonarda is married and has 3 children who are 14, 8, and 6 years old. She sells meat. Leonarda buys pigs and rams; she kills them at her house and sells the meat. Her husband and children help her in the business. The greatest difficulty that she faces is the region's flash floods, often requiring her to rebuild her business. She requests a loan of 400 PEN to buy livestock and feed for the animals. Her dream is to sell wholesale, for which she would need to invest more money. Currently she is saving to buy blankets for her children, who study out of town.\r\n\r\nAng\u00e9lica is married and has 5 children who are 13, 10, 8, 6 and 2 years old. With her first loan she received 6 months ago, she bought clothes for her children, not knowing to invest in her business. Only with part of the loan she bought small animals to raise at home and sell, slowly repaying her loan. Because of the bad investment she had problems but in spite of the difficulties she felt responsible and repaid her first loan. She requests another loan of 800 PEN to start her business; she wants to have a chicken farm so she can sell and eat the eggs. She would like to save for the repairs her house needs.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Vivian Lu, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2375,"image":{"id":333356,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Fulfill loan requests between 200 and 800 PEN, to be used in businesses.

At the same time, she is in her house taking care of her family.  She currently needs a greater investment to be able to fill the existing demand.  She does not have sufficient capital.  With the economic support she gives her husband, they have improved their house.  This motivates her to keep going forward.\r\n\r\nAntonia del Carmen V. is married.  She and her husband are now alone, just as they started out.  Their children have left home to form their own families.  Her primary business is making and selling tortillas.  With the income she receives she contributes to the food expenses.  Her husband works as a guard at the Institute, but his income is not much.  However, by putting the two incomes together they have been able to get ahead.  They have improved their house, and they feel very happy.\r\n\r\nLuis Edgardo L. works for a coffee processor.  On his days off he sells new clothes on foot.  He has been doing this for many years, and he has a good client base.  He currently needs to better stock his business.  That is why he is asking for a loan, to increase his income and achieve a better level of life.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":182857,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"Buy corn, wood, oil, pork skin, packaging bags ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Danli","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.033333 -86.583333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":118,"posted_date":"2009-06-10T23:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Norma Suyapa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Antonia Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luis Edgardo ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":17000,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2428.57},{"due_date":"2009-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2428.57},{"due_date":"2009-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2428.57},{"due_date":"2009-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2428.57},{"due_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2428.57},{"due_date":"2009-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2428.57},{"due_date":"2010-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2428.58}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.57},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.57},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.57},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.57},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.57},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.57},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":90.77,"local_amount":1714.55,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T23:43:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1716.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53007682,"comment":null},{"amount":52.94,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:04:22Z","rounded_local_amount":1001.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63229922,"comment":null},{"amount":166.39,"local_amount":3142.87,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:14:08Z","rounded_local_amount":3147.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73661500,"comment":null},{"amount":128.57,"local_amount":2428.58,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T01:44:23Z","rounded_local_amount":2431.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87101529,"comment":null},{"amount":166.4,"local_amount":3143.13,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T05:44:10Z","rounded_local_amount":3147.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97018553,"comment":null},{"amount":113.45,"local_amount":2142.87,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:28:28Z","rounded_local_amount":2145.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103863200,"comment":null},{"amount":105.88,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:26:47Z","rounded_local_amount":2002.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110752895,"comment":null},{"amount":75.6,"local_amount":1428,"processed_date":"2010-01-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:28:41Z","rounded_local_amount":1429.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118141971,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-06-17T03:13:16Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T12:28:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":114567,"name":"Ray","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ray is in the business of providing solutions to homes and businesses.

In addition, Aurora rents space to a number of businesses in a commercial district in her city. These two sources of income provide her with enough to cover her family's expenses and her children's education. In the near future, Aurora would like to have a well-supplied sewing workshop, since she works from home at the moment. This is her sixth loan with MFP, and what she likes about her communal bank is that all the members are responsible with their payments, as well as being very engaged in the variety of activities required by their loan advisor. She will use the requested loan to purchase sewing supplies (cloth, thread, etc.), as well as repairing structural damage in one of her commercial spaces so she can rent it out.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Andrea Rosenberg, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":333580,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","use":"Purchase sewing materials and repairing one of her rental spaces","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-06-11T14:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aurora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":297.85},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":315.2},{"due_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":327.8},{"due_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":338.04},{"due_date":"2009-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":354.43},{"due_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":366.68}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.52},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.38},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.63},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.09},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":119.62},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":123.76}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":100.52,"local_amount":297.85,"processed_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:43:05Z","rounded_local_amount":302.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990743,"comment":null},{"amount":106.38,"local_amount":315.2,"processed_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:44:54Z","rounded_local_amount":319.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211844,"comment":null},{"amount":110.63,"local_amount":327.8,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:29:20Z","rounded_local_amount":332.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641371,"comment":null},{"amount":114.09,"local_amount":338.04,"processed_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:39:26Z","rounded_local_amount":342.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080810,"comment":null},{"amount":119.62,"local_amount":354.43,"processed_date":"2009-10-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:15:00Z","rounded_local_amount":359.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996951,"comment":null},{"amount":123.76,"local_amount":366.68,"processed_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:55:30Z","rounded_local_amount":371.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842290,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-06-16T23:13:30Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T13:55:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":114591,"name":"Mar\u00eda Mercedes","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":" \nLa se\u00f1ora Mar\u00eda S. se dedica a su negocio de venta de productos diversos ofrecidos en su propia pulper\u00eda la cual ha logrado manejar y sacar adelante gracias a sus esfuerzos por mejorar el negocio.\n\nElla es una dama que ha logrado aprovechar los cr\u00e9ditos brindados por Ceprodel y hoy en d\u00eda una vez m\u00e1s acude para ser beneficiada con un nuevo cr\u00e9dito que le permita la compra de dichos productos para ofertarlos en la pulper\u00eda y de esta manera contribuir al bienestar de su amada familia que tiene que mantener.\n\n","en":"Mar\u00eda S. dedicates herself to the her business in the sale of various products offered in her small grocery store, which she has been able to manage and continue expanding thanks to her efforts to improve the business. \r\n\r\nShe is a woman who has been able to take advantage of the loans offered by Ceprodel and now she again seeks a new loan that will allow her to purchase products to offer in her small grocery store;
