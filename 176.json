In her town the people work in such activities as coffee production, vegetable farming, commerce, and the production of crafts. Laura has been married for 20 years and has three children: Adriana, who is 19, Karen, who is 17, and Kevin, who is 14. All three are students. When they got married, her husband was a farmer and she worked in the home. \r\n\r\nThey hoped to improve their living conditions, so they looked for alternatives. Fifteen years ago they started a business making clothes. At first they didn\u2019t know anything about the business, so they experimented bit by bit. Now, Laura makes different types of clothing and sells it to businesses in the community and nearby towns, with the help of her husband. The business has greatly improved her family\u2019s living conditions. Her greatest satisfaction is the fact that all of their children are able to study. \r\n\r\nLaura is part of the Empresa de Cr\u00e9dito Comunal de San Crist\u00f3bal Norte (SACRIN) (Communal Credit Enterprise of San Crist\u00f3bal Norte), one of the 100 EDESA partner organizations in Costa Rica. As a member, she has received a total of 10 micro loans, which have allowed her to grow as an entrepreneur and to provide for her household\u2019s needs. All of this has allowed her to improve her self-esteem, as she has gone from being a homemaker to a business owner. \r\n\r\nLaura is currently requesting a loan of $1,200.00 to buy a special sewing machine (Kober brand). This sewing machine will allow her to make hems in blouses, t-shirts, and other clothing items. With this investment, she hopes to increase her production and improve the quality of her products. Laura says that thanks to this loan, she will be able to offer better options to her customers.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jennifer Day, Kiva

In addition to operating his farm, Gabriel sells grocery products in a kiosk in the community in order to generate additional income to support his business.\r\n\r\nHowever, he has been having difficulties with his farm because there is a disease attacking his cocoa crops.

There is a particular tree in the forest that can be used to design or manufacture the mortar. Felicia goes to the forest and places the timber logs in order to be used for the mortar. It is said that the Ashanties use mortar more than the other tribes in Ghana. \r\n\r\nFor the past two years now, Felicia has been doing this to take care of her home. It has become a challenge as she finds it difficult to get wood for the mortar as a result of a government warning on the frequent cutting of timber in our forest reserves. She is requesting the loan to buy wood to manufacture the mortar. With her larger customer base, Felicia believes she can make lots of profit from the business growth to help her kids in school.

She understands customer ethics and is also aware that the customer is cash for that reason she does not down-play quality and excellent service. She prepares and sells local foods like fufu, banku and other local dishes. Fufu is prepared from pounded cassava and plantains, taken with all kinds of soup. Banku is prepared from milled maize grains and it is taken with hot pepper or soup. With her tasty meals she has attracted lots of customers in the area where she works. Therefore it has become necessary to employ additional hands to assist her in her food delivering service. <P>\r\n\r\nGeorgina says prices of raw materials have gone up significantly and she needs the support of a loan to enable her to meet her production expenditure. With the loan, she wants to purchase more raw materials like bags of maize, baskets of cassava, plantains, meat, fish, vegetables and firewood to prepare her meals. She would be grateful for your assistance. She believes she can fulfill her late husband's dream by providing the children with education. Georgina belongs to a village bank called Sarah.

Vive en una casa propia con su esposa. A\u00fan no tiene hijos. Su familia se ha dedicado desde hace muchos a\u00f1os a la ganader\u00eda tanto para leche como para carne. \u00c9l sigui\u00f3 los mismos pasos y actualmente tiene una finca que es la que le ayuda a salir adelante. \nLa comunidad en la cual vive Danny se llama El Sauce de Santa Teresita de Turrialba. Es una peque\u00f1a comunidad rural de unos dos mil habitantes. Sus pobladores se dedican a la producci\u00f3n de leche y siembra de caf\u00e9. Tiene un relieve irregular y mucho del terreno se mantiene como bosque tropical h\u00famedo. La comunidad tiene paisajes muy pintorescos que combinan el bosque tropical con dos lindas lagunas, plantaciones de caf\u00e9 y lecher\u00edas. El Sauce se localiza aproximadamente a hora y media en bus de Turrialba, el centro de comercio m\u00e1s cercano, sin embargo varias veces al a\u00f1o, el camino se vuelve intransitable por las lluvias que caen en la zona. Este es sin duda uno de los principales desaf\u00edos para la comunidad. Cuando no exist\u00edan actividades muchas personas optaron por salir a buscar trabajos en Turrialba o en fincas bananeras ubicadas en el Atl\u00e1ntico de Costa Rica. Actualmente los precios del caf\u00e9 y la leche han mejorado por lo tanto los vecinos buscan c\u00f3mo invertir en proyectos en la misma zona.\nHace dos a\u00f1os, se instal\u00f3 en la comunidad una planta de elaboraci\u00f3n de quesos de la Asociaci\u00f3n de Productores de Leche de El Sauce. Por lo tanto, en los \u00faltimos dos a\u00f1os Danny ha ido especializ\u00e1ndose en la producci\u00f3n de leche que luego vende a esta planta. \nEl queso de la regi\u00f3n donde vive Danny es famoso en todo Costa Rica. Es un queso fresco que se le conoce tradicionalmente como \u201cQueso Turrialba\u201d. A los \u201cticos\u201d (como se les conoce a los habitantes de Costa Rica) les gusta mucho comprar el queso Turrialba para comerlo en el desayuno junto con tortillas, arroz, frijoles y huevos. Por esta raz\u00f3n, el mercado para el queso que se har\u00e1 con la leche que venda Danny es muy bueno.\nDanny desea obtener un microcr\u00e9dito para comprar una vaca lechera m\u00e1s y as\u00ed aumentar la producci\u00f3n de leche. El sabe que contar con una vaca m\u00e1s es un mayor sacrificio y demandar\u00e1 m\u00e1s trabajo pero dice que si quiere sacar su familia adelante tiene que esforzarse en producir m\u00e1s. Danny dice que sacar\u00e1 este pr\u00e9stamo para mejorar la calidad de vida de su esposa y de \u00e9l en este momento y si con el paso de los a\u00f1os hay hijos que tengan una mejor calidad de vida y tal vez que ellos puedan tener la oportunidad de estudiar que \u00e9l no tuvo.\nActualmente Danny orde\u00f1a a mano en una peque\u00f1a instalaci\u00f3n de madera que acondicion\u00f3 como sala de orde\u00f1o. Si aumenta la producci\u00f3n espera ir haciendo un local mejor y en unos a\u00f1os poder comprar un equipo de orde\u00f1o. Tambi\u00e9n le gustar\u00eda ir mejorando los pastos con variedades m\u00e1s adecuadas para la producci\u00f3n de leche y as\u00ed contar con una finca que le permita producir m\u00e1s.\nDanny es cliente de la Asociaci\u00f3n de Productores de El Sauce, una organizaci\u00f3n local socia de la microfinanciera EDESA. Gracias a su vinculaci\u00f3n con esta organizaci\u00f3n ha obtenido ya 5 microcr\u00e9ditos y los ha cancelado satisfactoriamente. Los montos han ido incrementando desde los US$ 300, US$ 430, US$ 500, US$ 600 y US$ 700. Actualmente  Danny necesita un pr\u00e9stamo por $1.000 para comprar su vaca lechera. \n","en":"Danny Villalobos R. is 31 years old. He lives in his own house with his wife. They do not have children yet. His family has had cattle for many years, for both milk production and meat production. He has followed the same path and now has a farm that helps him to get ahead.\r\n\r\nThe community where Danny lives is called El Sauce de Santa Teresita de Turrialba. It is a small, rural town of two thousand inhabitants. The people of the town work in milk production and coffee farming. The topography is hilly and most of the area is maintained as tropical rainforest. The town has very picturesque landscapes that combine the tropical forest with pretty ponds, coffee plantations, and dairies. El Sauce is located approximately one and a half hours by bus from Turrialba, the closest center of commerce. Even so, several times a year the road becomes impassible because of the rains. This is, without a doubt, one of the biggest challenges for the community. When there weren\u2019t many jobs, many people chose to leave to look for work in Turrialba or in banana plantations located on the Atlantic coast of Costa Rica. Lately the prices of coffee and milk have improved, so now people from the area are looking for ways to invest in projects there. Two years ago a cheese processing plant was started by the Milk Producers Association of El Sauce. Because of this, for the past two years Danny has been specializing in producing milk that he then sells to the cheese factory.\r\n\r\nThe cheese from the region where Danny lives is famous throughout Costa Rica. It is a fresh cheese that is traditionally known as \u201cTurriabla Cheese.\u201d Ticos (a nick-name for the people Costa Rica) like to buy Turrialba cheese to eat it at breakfast, along with tortillas, rice, beans, and eggs. This is why the market for the milk that Danny sells, which is then made into cheese, is very good.\r\n\r\nDanny hopes to obtain a micro-loan to buy another dairy cow so that he can increase the milk production. He knows that having another cow is a big sacrifice and will require more work, but he says that if he wants to help his family get ahead, he\u2019ll have to work hard to produce more. Danny says he will take out this loan to improve the quality of life for his wife and himself right now; if the years pass and there are children, he hopes they will have a better quality of life and maybe they can have the opportunity to study that he didn\u2019t have.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Danny milks by hand in a small wooden shed that he set up as a milking room. If his production increases, he hopes to construct a better building and then, in a few years, be able to buy a milking machine. He would also like to improve his pasture with varieties of grass that are better suited to milk production and in this way have a farm that will allow him to produce more.\r\n\r\nDanny is a client of the Producers Association of El Sauce, a local partner organization of the microfinance organization EDESA. Because of his ties to this organization, he has received 5 micro-loans and he has repaid them satisfactorily. The amounts have increased from US$300.00, to US$430.00, to US$500.00, to US$600.00, and to $700.00. Danny now needs a loan of $1,000.00 to buy his dairy cow.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jennifer Day, Kiva

S\u00f3lo tuvo un hijo que ya es mayor de edad y se atiende s\u00f3lo. Ella vive en una peque\u00f1a casa donde tambi\u00e9n instal\u00f3 su negocio, una pulper\u00eda (tiendita de abarrotes) para vender productos b\u00e1sicos a sus vecinos. \nLa comunidad en la cual ella vive se llama El Sauce de Santa Teresita de Turrialba. Es una peque\u00f1a comunidad rural de unos dos mil habitantes. Sus pobladores se dedican a la producci\u00f3n de leche y siembra de caf\u00e9. Tiene un relieve irregular y mucho del terreno se mantiene como bosque tropical h\u00famedo. La comunidad tiene paisajes muy pintorescos que combinan el bosque tropical con dos lindas lagunas, plantaciones de caf\u00e9 y lecher\u00edas. El Sauce se localiza aproximadamente a hora y media en bus de Turrialba, el centro de comercio m\u00e1s cercano, sin embargo varias veces al a\u00f1o, el camino se vuelve intransitable por las lluvias que caen en la zona. Este es sin duda uno de los principales desaf\u00edos para la comunidad. Cuando no exist\u00edan actividades muchas personas optaron por salir a buscar trabajos en Turrialba o en fincas bananeras ubicadas en el Atl\u00e1ntico de Costa Rica. Actualmente los precios del caf\u00e9 y la leche han mejorado por lo tanto la poblaci\u00f3n busca invertir con proyectos en la misma zona.\nDo\u00f1a Deyanira inici\u00f3 su negocio hace aproximadamente un a\u00f1o. Su objetivo es tener una actividad econ\u00f3mica rentable que no la obligue emigrar a Turrialba a buscar trabajo como empleada dom\u00e9stica. A\u00fan no puede mantener abierto el negocio todo el tiempo que quisiera ya que no tiene suficiente capital como para invertirlo en comprar toda la mercader\u00eda necesaria. Ella comenta que al tener el negocio en su propia casa no tiene que pagar alquiler o construir un local lo cual le ayuda a que el negocio salga adelante.\nCon el microcr\u00e9dito que ha solicitado, ella desea comprar m\u00e1s mercader\u00eda que pueda vender para as\u00ed hacer m\u00e1s grande el negocio y brindar un mejor servicio a sus vecinos. Espec\u00edficamente comprar\u00e1 abarrotes b\u00e1sicos como arroz, frijoles, verduras, productos enlatados, refrescos, jab\u00f3n, y todo lo que se refiere a la canasta b\u00e1sica del costarricense que vive en las zonas rurales. Deyanira comenta que el servicio que ella brinda es muy importante ya que no existe otra pulper\u00eda en la zona. Ella espera que el microcr\u00e9dito le ayude a impulsar su negocio, colaborar con la comunidad y que las personas no tengan que viajar hasta Turrialba para comprar sus abarrotes.\nDeyanira es cliente de la Asociaci\u00f3n de Productores de El Sauce, una organizaci\u00f3n local socia de la microfinanciera EDESA. Gracias a su vinculaci\u00f3n con esta organizaci\u00f3n, ella ha obtenido varios micropr\u00e9stamos para su negocio los cuales ha pagado satisfactoriamente. Los montos han ido incrementando desde los US$ 200, US$ 550 y US$ 600. Actualmente ella necesita un pr\u00e9stamo por $1.000 para realizar la compra de la mercader\u00eda necesaria para ampliar su negocio. \n","en":"Deyanira Montero J. is single mother who is 45 years old. She only had one son, and he is grown up and provides for himself. She lives in a small house where she also has her business, a small grocery store, where she sells basic products to her neighbors. The community in which she lives is called El Sauce de Santa Teresita de Turrialba. It is a small, rural town with two thousand inhabitants. They work primarily in milk production and coffee farming. It has a hilly topography and most of the area is maintained as tropical rainforest. The town has very picturesque landscapes that combine the tropical forest with pretty ponds, coffee plantations, and dairies.\r\n\r\nEl Sauce is located approximately one-and-a-half hours by bus from Turrialba, the nearest center of commerce. However, several times per year the road becomes impassible due to the rains. This is, without a doubt, one of the greatest challenges for the community. When there weren\u2019t many jobs, many people chose to leave to look for work in Turrialba or in banana plantations located on the Atlantic coast of Costa Rica. Lately the prices of coffee and milk have improved, so now people from the area are looking for ways to invest in projects there. Deyanira began her business approximately one year ago. Her goal is to have economically feasible work so that she won\u2019t have to emigrate to Turrialba to work as domestic help. She still can\u2019t keep her business open as much as she would like because she doesn\u2019t have enough capital to invest in all of the necessary merchandise. She explains that having the business in her home means she doesn\u2019t have to pay rent or construct a building, which helps her move ahead with her business. \r\n\r\nWith the micro-loan she has requested, she hopes to buy more merchandise to sell and thereby grow the business and provide better service to her neighbors. Specifically, she will buy basic grocery goods, such as rice, beans, vegetables, canned goods, soft drinks, soap, and everything else that rural Costa Ricans typically need. Deyanira has commented that the service that she provides is very important because there is no other small grocery store in the area. She hopes the micro-loan will give momentum to her business and help her to collaborate with the community so that people won\u2019t have to travel to Turrialbla to buy groceries.  \r\n\r\nDeyanira is a client of the Producers Assocation of El Sauce, a local partner organization of the microfinance organization EDESA. Because of her ties to this organization, she has obtained several micro-loans for her business, which she has repaid satisfactorily. The amounts have increased from US$200.00, to US$550.00, to US$600.00. She currently needs a loan of $1,000.00 to buy the merchandise that is necessary to grow her business. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jennifer Day, Kiva

San Rafael is a rural community where most people raise livestock for milk and meat.  It has a warm climate and is very popular with tourists who come to see the Arenal volcano, the clear blue rivers, hot springs, lakes, mountains and the natural beauty of the region.  Pineapple, cassava, oranges and beans are some of the crops grown in the surrounding agricultural areas.\r\n\r\nSilvia is married to Carlos Garc\u00eda and they have a two-month-old daughter named Jimena.  Silvia and Carlos work together on a 12-hectare farm which they rent; this is also where their home is.  They have been raising livestock on this farm for two years.  Her family has a long tradition of raising livestock as both her father and grandfather were in the livestock business.  Silvia is also working hard to finish her university degree which she pays for with the revenues from farming.\r\n\r\nBecause she wants to increase her income to improve her quality of life and be able to continue studying, Silvia needs a microloan of USD $1,000.

Although the house does not yet have electricity, she doesn't get discouraged and is determined to get ahead with the business she started. Without anyone's help, Demetria goes out pushing her little cart every night to sell her delicious salchimotes (a food made of fried corn and sliced sausages), which are sampled by passersby. Many people end up eating three or four plates. Her business is doing very well, thanks to her low-priced salchimotes. She loves it when customers praise their delicious flavor, but she doesn't like having to endure the freezing cold at night. She's worked in this business for 10 years and has decided to improve it.

Tiene una peque\u00f1a finca en la cual hay una naciente de agua en la parte m\u00e1s alta.\nGrifo Alto es una comunidad rural que se ubica aproximadamente a una hora de San Jos\u00e9 que es la capital de Costa Rica. Queda en las monta\u00f1as y tiene una vista muy linda de valles, r\u00edos y monta\u00f1as que miran a la costa pac\u00edfica de Costa Rica. Grifo Alto queda sobre la carretera que va hacia las playas por lo tanto muchos turistas paran ah\u00ed a comer, o simplemente disfrutar de los paisajes y el ambiente rural. En la zona hay muchas fincas peque\u00f1as que se dedican tanto a la agricultura como a la ganader\u00eda. Anteriormente se sembraba mucho tabaco pero luego los precios bajaron y la gente busc\u00f3 otras opciones.\nDon Carlos aprovech\u00f3 la naciente de agua que hay en su finca y construy\u00f3 un estanque para criar tilapias. Por su edad y lo dif\u00edcil del terreno tard\u00f3 casi dos a\u00f1os para hacer el estanque utilizando s\u00f3lo un pico y una pala porque en el lugar no puede entrar maquinaria porque es muy inclinado. Don Carlos dice que le cost\u00f3 mucho hacerlo especialmente sacar las piedras m\u00e1s grandes. \nUna vez hecho el estanque comenz\u00f3 a criar tilapias. Cuando crecieron las primeras comenz\u00f3 a venderlas con una hielera a la orilla de la carretera que pasa frente a su finca. Luego de un a\u00f1o, como el negocio iba bien pens\u00f3 construir un negocio peque\u00f1o y tuvo la idea de cocinar la tilapia y venderla preparada en platos con comida t\u00edpica. El plato t\u00edpico en Costa Rica se conoce como \u201cel casado\u201d e incluye arroz, frijoles, tortillas, pl\u00e1tanos, ensalada y tilapia u otra carne. En su negocio participan su esposa y su hija quienes atienden el restaurante.\nAl d\u00eda de hoy el Ministerio de Salud le est\u00e1 pidiendo varios requisitos para ampliar el local y dar un mejor servicio a sus clientes. Por esta raz\u00f3n est\u00e1 solicitando un microcr\u00e9dito de $ 540 que le permita comprar madera, pintura, clavos y otros materiales para ampliar el local. \nDon Carlos es socio de la Empresa de Cr\u00e9dito Comunal de Grifo Alto de Puriscal la cual es una de las organizaciones comunales socias de EDESA.

A. is 65 years old and lives in Costa Rica in the community of Grifo Alto de Puriscal. He is married and lives with his wife and daughter who is named Marisela G.. He has a small farm, in which there is a spring in the higher part. \r\n\r\nGrifo Alto is a rural community that is situated approximately one hour from San Jose, the capital of Costa Rica. It is situated in the mountains, and it has a beautiful view of the valleys, rivers and mountains that look out over the coast of Costa Rica. Grifo Alto is along the highway that goes to the beach, and for this reason, many tourists stop there to eat or simply to enjoy themselves in the countryside and rural surroundings. In this area, there are many small farms that are dedicated to raising cattle. Before that, they raised tobacco, but then the price went down and people looked for other options. \r\n\r\nDon Carlos improved the spring that is on his farm and constructed a pond where he raises tilapi. Because of his age and the difficulty of the terrain, almost two years passed making the pool, utilizing only a pick and shovel because the place is so steep that machinery can\u2019t get there. Don Carlos says that it cost a lot to make, especially moving the very large rocks.\r\n\r\nOne time he finished making the pool and began raising tilapia. When the first ones were born, he began to sell them in an ice bucket along the edge of the highway that passes in front of his farm. After one year, when the business was going well, he thought he would make a little more business, and he had the idea of cooking the tilpapia and selling it prepared on plates with customary foods. The customary food in Costa Rica is known as \u201cthe marriage\u201d and includes rice, beans, tortillas, plantains, salad and tilapia or another meat. His wife helps in this business, and his daughter works in the restaurant part. \r\n\r\nAt the present time, the Minister of Health is asking that various requirements be met for improving business and giving better service to customers. For this reason, arlos is asking for $540 that will enable him to buy wood, paint, nails, and other materials to improve the location. \r\n\r\nDon Carlos is a member of the Communal Credit Corporation of Grifo Alto of Puriscal, which is one of the communal organizations of EDESA. Actually, he is not counting on a loan, but he has seen the value of investment capital from this organization.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Misty McNally, Kiva

Anteriormente se dedicaba con su familia al ganado de engorde (carne) pero poco a poco ha ido cambiando al ganado de leche lo cual le ha ayudado a sacar adelante a su familia.\nDon Olman vive en El Sauce de Santa Teresita de Turrialba. Es una peque\u00f1a comunidad rural de unos dos mil habitantes. Sus pobladores se dedican principalmente a la producci\u00f3n de leche y siembra de caf\u00e9. Tiene un relieve irregular y mucho del terreno se mantiene como bosque tropical h\u00famedo.

He has been producing milk for three years. Previously, he and his family were raised cattle, but little by little he has shifted to dairy, which has helped him to move his family forward. \r\n\r\nDon Olman lives in El Sauce de Santa Teresita in Turrialba. It's a small rural community of 2,000 residents. The settlers all work mainly in milk production and coffee planting.  It has a rugged terrain and much of the ground is damp tropical forest. The community has very picturesque scenery: tropical forest combined with two pretty lakes, coffee plantations, and dairy farms. El Sauce is located about 1.5 hours by bus from Turrialba, the closest commercial center, however several times a year, the road becomes impassable from the rains that fall in the region. This is without doubt one of the main challenges for the community. When there were not a lot of activities, many people opted to leave and search for work in Turrialba or on banana farms located on the Atlantic in Costa Rica. Presently, the price of coffee and milk has improved, hence the neighbors are looking to invest in projects in their own region. \r\n\r\nDon Olman started planting a small area of his farm with pasture which has given him better food for his dairy cows. Moreover, he wants to keep his costs low by using food that he can produce on his own farm instead of needing to buy extract and other food that is more expensive. Presently, his grass is cut and picked by hand using a machete. Don Olman wants to take out of loan of \u00a2500.000 ($900) to buy more grass seed and a machine to pick the grass.  He says he will achieve more food for the cows within his own farm and he will be able to improve his output and make more money. The loan he is going to take will improve the quality of life of his two children and his wife. If there are more earnings, it benefits the whole family.\r\n\r\nDon Olman is a client of the Association of Producers of El Sauce, a local organization that partners with the microfinance institution EDESA.  Thanks to his connection with this organization, he has already received four loans, and all have been repaid satisfactorily. When Don Olman started he had no land or cows, but through his connection to the organization he has taken loans and repaid them, and this has changed his life, so that now he is considered a micro-entrepreneur. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Cara Gutterman, Kiva

With the loan from Microfinanzas PRISMA, she will buy more wool and expand her business; she also wants to buy weavings ready-made in order to sell them which she estimates will cost her 1000 soles.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Laure Kwon, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":267321,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","use":"To buy materials for weaving","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-02-10T03:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":165}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.6}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":54.28,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-03-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:31:52Z","rounded_local_amount":175.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117030,"comment":null},{"amount":54.28,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:43:25Z","rounded_local_amount":175.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117031,"comment":null},{"amount":54.27,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:53:58Z","rounded_local_amount":175.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011944,"comment":null},{"amount":54.28,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-06-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:37:07Z","rounded_local_amount":175.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989790,"comment":null},{"amount":54.28,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:45:23Z","rounded_local_amount":175.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989791,"comment":null},{"amount":53.61,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:46:13Z","rounded_local_amount":173.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210922,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-02-10T04:35:50Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T16:46:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":87685,"name":"Maria Hortencia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Do\u00f1a Maria Hortencia tiene 46 a\u00f1os de edad, reside en  villa reconciliaci\u00f3n con cuatro hermosos hijos mayores de edad, su esposo vende repuestos de motos en un establecimiento de un mercado de la capital, su negocio es una pulper\u00eda y vende tambi\u00e9n medicamentos, ropa zapatos con mucho esfuerzo ha logrado establecer este negocio con ahorro y ayuda de su esposo desde hace quince a\u00f1os, y cr\u00e9ditos que Afodenic le ha brindado para crecer en  su negocio, con esta solicitud es la once la cual va invertir en insumos diarios para ofertar a sus clientes.

His goal is to keep his business going because he totally depends on it as his only source of income and a means to help his brother, nieces and nephews, his only family.  He most wants to set the business up in a better place because he would like to have his own shop, preferably in his house, a grocery where he can sell his merchandise.  He dreams of remodeling his humble house and teaching his nieces and nephews the importance of hard work in reaching your goals.  Buenaventura has borrowed from Fundacion Leon 2000 before and his performance has been very good.  He's made a success of the business because he's persistent and because he knows that he can get what he wants if he works hard.\r\n<p>\r\nBuenaventura makes a living selling snacks and cold drinks.  His business is located on the northern edge of UNAN, just outside the university.  He's operated the business for 20 years.  He started it on his own, having learned to work hard from the time he was a boy, with only a few products kept in a basket, selling cigarettes and candy to passers-by.  He worked as a street vendor around Leon where he met a lot of students who were customers for the cigarettes he sold.  The work was exhausting because his house was far away, so he decided to find a spot to set up permanently.  He had to find a place with a lot of passers-by so he decided on the street near UNAN.  Buenaventura has borrowed from Fundacion twice and has a good payment record.  He's now applying for a loan which he will use for working capital.  He'll increase the range of products he sells to meet customer demand and buy from different distributors in Leon so that he can get a favorable return for Fundacion Leon 2000 and the organizations that are interested in helping small businessmen.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":267348,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Working capital.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-02-07T03:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Buenaventura Ojetaciano","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":6000,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":57.95,"local_amount":1158.94,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:38:06Z","rounded_local_amount":1158.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27092059,"comment":null},{"amount":42.05,"local_amount":841.06,"processed_date":"2009-04-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:36:46Z","rounded_local_amount":841.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35985441,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-05-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:08:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44446057,"comment":null},{"amount":50.73,"local_amount":1014.56,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:42:11Z","rounded_local_amount":1014.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52956694,"comment":null},{"amount":99.27,"local_amount":1985.44,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T14:00:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1985.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63174117,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

F. is 25 years old and married.  This young entrepreneur has no children.  Her life has been spent working for herself, and her intentions are to support her business.  Previously, she had the experience to own this business but due to the economic situation her business declined; now her intentions are to keep promoting the sale of her clothes. Her goals are to improve herself in life and she recently studied in the last year of her career, for she wants to fight to achieve that goal, as the situation in the country is difficult and she wants to have children who can have a good place to study and live and a solid economic base. Her dreams are to be a great entrepreneur who generates income inside her country and have an economic influence at the national level.  It is one of her dreams that she would like to make the country progress and that students can have the confidence to develop their personal ambition. \r\n\r\nYoung Gema's economic activity is selling used clothes and cosmetics.  She has owned her business for four years, and it is located in her house.  Gema started this activity with the objective of financing her university studies.  With the help of her mother she received a loan from Fundacion Leon in 2000; she achieved the financing to start this business, and has since tried to maintain it, with much effort and sacrifice.  Some times her studies would not allow her to give it complete attention; it was very difficult in the beginning and she did not have many clients or many options to offer them, and moreover she had to overcome the crisis facing her family, and some times she had to leave to sell on the street.  However, when she obtained enough clients, her business became fruitful and this is the reason she decided to ask for financing for working capital, as she has to buy her products by the box, and moreover she has to travel to Managua and Chinandega, for that is where it is most favorable to make her purchases. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Cara Gutterman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":267353,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"Capital to buy clothes and cosmetics","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-02-10T06:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gema Daly ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":5500,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":458.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":458.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":458.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":458.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":458.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":458.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":458.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":458.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":458.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":458.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":458.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":458.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":23.7,"local_amount":474.01,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:38:17Z","rounded_local_amount":474.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27092060,"comment":null},{"amount":22.13,"local_amount":442.65,"processed_date":"2009-04-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:36:54Z","rounded_local_amount":442.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35985442,"comment":null},{"amount":22.92,"local_amount":458.33,"processed_date":"2009-05-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:08:28Z","rounded_local_amount":458.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44446058,"comment":null},{"amount":22.92,"local_amount":458.33,"processed_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:38:49Z","rounded_local_amount":458.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52956695,"comment":null},{"amount":183.33,"local_amount":3666.68,"processed_date":"2009-07-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T13:59:34Z","rounded_local_amount":3666.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63174118,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-02-10T10:01:38Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T13:59:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":87689,"name":"Maria De La Concepcion","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda de la Concepci\u00f3n P.

D. is 59 years old, married, and has 2 children.  Her eldest son is 15 years old and is in his third year of high school.  Her youngest son is 7 years old and is in the third grade of elementary school.  Her husband works for himself now because he has come down with an illness but they still need to retain the customers that provide the family with their main source of income.  Now, he is fighting to recover and it is difficult to return to work.  Still, he is thinking about the future and hopes to save enough money for retirement and to better provide for his household.  \r\n\r\nDona Maria has been running a business selling second-hand clothing and cosmetics out of their home for 8 years, and also traveling to visit customers.  She first started the business to help generate more income for the family.  She specifically decided to sell second-hand clothing since she did not know what type of work she could do after she was previously a pork butcher.  They previously owned a small store, but they could not continue running the store while his illness required him to stay in bed.

Her family is currently residing in Barangay Cabisera 14-16 of Ilagan, Isabela, where there are existing community projects such as building new community centers and a clean and green program. \r\n\r\nJesica is requesting a loan amounting to PHP 4,000.00 for her rice vending business to assist her husband with their financial and basic needs for their family. She will buy four sacks of rice averaging 50 kilos per sack for the business. She also shared that with a sack of rice, she can earn a net income of PHP150, enough to support their daily immediate needs at home. She hopes to expand the business further in the future. Jesica said despite the hardships of life, they must still go on and must do something in order to overcome life's difficulties.

Both the preceding loans were correctly reimbursed. <P>\r\n\r\nThey intend to use this loan to buy lengths of \"bazin\" wholesale in Bamako (the capital of the Republic of Mali) as well as dyes, etc. The dyed \"bazin\" is sold retail in the market in Koutiala. <P>\r\n\r\nThey each hope to make an average profit of 110,000 F CFA over the course of this loan cycle, which will be used to repay the loan and cover the expenses of their extended families, investing any remainder in their businesses. Their ambition is to diversify their businesses by taking up other income-generating activities such as opening a beauty salon.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1375,"image":{"id":267530,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","use":"dyeing, purchase of \"bazin\" cloth, and coiffure","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"KOUTIALA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.383333 -5.466667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-03-02T17:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ami ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djen\u00e8ba ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nematou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djen\u00e8bou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Korotoumou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adiaratou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Niagna ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":700000,"loan_amount":1375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":116666.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":116666.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":116666.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":116666.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":116666.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":116666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":229.17},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":229.17},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.17},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.17},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.17},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":458.33,"local_amount":233333.34,"processed_date":"2009-03-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:08:25Z","rounded_local_amount":235073.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135818,"comment":null},{"amount":229.16,"local_amount":116666.67,"processed_date":"2009-04-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:29:03Z","rounded_local_amount":117536.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033617,"comment":null},{"amount":229.17,"local_amount":116666.67,"processed_date":"2009-05-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:39:19Z","rounded_local_amount":117536.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44620985,"comment":null},{"amount":229.17,"local_amount":116666.67,"processed_date":"2009-06-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:21:56Z","rounded_local_amount":117536.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53019950,"comment":null},{"amount":229.17,"local_amount":116666.65,"processed_date":"2009-07-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:19:32Z","rounded_local_amount":117536.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242695,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-03-02T22:08:02Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T19:19:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":87747,"name":"Karibea Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Happy S., age 35, is single.

This year, Ganchimeg is taking her fifth loan, with excellent credit history, to expand the grocery store. As a result of her business income, she bought a vehicle, and built a 30 square meter house for her mom. \r\n\r\nNow she needs a loan in the amount of MNT 900,000 to increase her capital as Mongolia's lunar New Year approaches at the end of February.

She tries to make more money for the family by working hard each day. About 15 years ago, she decided to start raising and selling animals. This way she pays for the education of her three children who have high hopes for the future. She raises calves and sheep and later sells them according to her clients' demand at the markets. She prepares them ready to eat for the eating pleasure of the people in her country. <P>\r\n\r\nSince Nortoji aspires to a great future, she decided to expand her businesses with the sole purpose of improving her family's living conditions and help pay for her children's education so that they can one day become good citizens in society.<P>\r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Kushmurod is 45 years old. He is married with three children. All his children are in school and are performing well. He has great passion for dairy farming and has been in this business for 15 years together with his wife. He would like to expand his business by adding another cow to the ones he has. This is because recently he acquired orders from outside town to supply milk. Kushmurod is requesting $ 800 USD in order to buy another cow and to feed them. With additional income Kushmurod will be better able to cater for his family's financial obligations, especially the education of his children.  \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Yuldoshboy was born in 1956 and is married with 6 children. As an aspiring and hard-working man he has always dreamed of achieving success in whatever he does. Thus, when he joined IMON International, he was able to make much progress with his previous loan, which he invested mostly in crop farming. Then, he saw a new business opportunity: rearing of the young cattle, which is very profitable because of the constant demand for meat at the market. Given this loan, Yuldoshboy will purchase young cattle and feed for them to expand his business. He plans to use the profits from his business to educate his children, improve the structure of his home, and improve the standard of living of his family.  \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

","en":"Ernestina de Socorro M. is 49-years-old, single, and has two children.  Her oldest son is 30 and works for himself.  Her younger son, 28, works and studies.  Her partner is a driver.  Ernestina wants to grow her general store so she can have more economic security and confidence, as everything depends on the national economy.  Her dream is that the economic aid we get from the industrialized countries will continue to support us as it has up to this point.  It really does provide a great benefit because it helps poor people grow, bringing a higher quality of life to each and every one of them.  \r\n\r\nErnestina would like to open a mini mart so she can earn more money to defray household expenses and her debt to the Foundation.  She wants to run a business in which customers are satisfied with their purchases.  She has been in business for 29 years, working from her house running a general store and selling food.  She went into business on her own initiative, opening a stall at the market; but then she started her food business, because food is very popular and she was looking to attract customers.  That's how she got into her current business.  She also added a candy basket to her store.  Circumstances, however, did not allow Ernestina to keep up her stall at the market because she couldn't pay the rent on the space, so she decided to set up shop in her house and run her business there.  Ernestina is seeking a loan for working capital so she can buy a selection of products, which she'll use to stock her store.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jill Heske, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":267637,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-02-07T18:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ernestina Del Socorro ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":4000,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":363.64},{"due_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":363.64},{"due_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":363.64},{"due_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":363.64},{"due_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":363.64},{"due_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":363.64},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":363.64},{"due_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":363.64},{"due_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":363.64},{"due_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":363.64},{"due_date":"2009-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":363.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":18.18},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":18.18},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.18},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.18},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.18},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.18},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.18},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.18},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.18},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.18},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.2}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":18.18,"local_amount":363.64,"processed_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:41:52Z","rounded_local_amount":366.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20400059,"comment":null},{"amount":18.18,"local_amount":363.64,"processed_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:36:44Z","rounded_local_amount":366.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27092062,"comment":null},{"amount":18.18,"local_amount":363.64,"processed_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:39:50Z","rounded_local_amount":366.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35985444,"comment":null},{"amount":18.18,"local_amount":363.64,"processed_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:10:56Z","rounded_local_amount":366.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44446060,"comment":null},{"amount":18.18,"local_amount":363.64,"processed_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:40:25Z","rounded_local_amount":366.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52956697,"comment":null},{"amount":18.18,"local_amount":363.64,"processed_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-05T09:31:01Z","rounded_local_amount":366.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":66055588,"comment":null},{"amount":18.18,"local_amount":363.64,"processed_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T15:30:01Z","rounded_local_amount":366.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73599723,"comment":null},{"amount":18.18,"local_amount":363.64,"processed_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T17:57:33Z","rounded_local_amount":366.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87035613,"comment":null},{"amount":5.64,"local_amount":112.83,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T21:43:37Z","rounded_local_amount":113.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96948016,"comment":null},{"amount":30.72,"local_amount":614.45,"processed_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:32:44Z","rounded_local_amount":619.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103789989,"comment":null},{"amount":18.2,"local_amount":363.6,"processed_date":"2009-12-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:32:10Z","rounded_local_amount":366.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110680680,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-02-07T23:20:18Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T13:32:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":87793,"name":"Adwoa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Adwoa N. is forty-five years old.

He is married. Marvin has three children whose ages are the following: his eldest son is 12 years old and is in his first year of secondary school. His other son is 10 years old and is in the 5th grade. His daughter is 8 years old and is the 4th grate. His life partner sells pastries and cosmetics. Marvin's goals are to increase his business enough to prevail since he always has been a person who does not neglect his responsibilities such as the support of his family. HIs dreams are to purchase a property for his children since where they live now belongs to his mother-in-law since they do not have the necessary resources to rent a house where they may live. He would also like to establish a pastry business for his wife since this would be a good fountain of income.\r\n\r\nMarvin's economic activity is selling general merchandise such as shorts, blouses, pants and underwear. He conducts business on foot. He's owned this business for nine years. Marvin started this business through family since, since he was young, his family taught him to earn money in an honest way. At the young age of 18, he began to sell products such as underwear and socks for men for which he traveled to different markets in search of customers to whom he could offer his merchandise. One of the most difficult things that he came across was starting without the support of his family. He decided to overcome this on his own and get his family ahead. His love for the work helped him obtain the business that he currently runs and for which he now needs a loan to purchase products since he thinks he will invest this money well so that his children will not have to go through the same difficulties that he encountered in order to support the business he possesses now.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kate Divjak, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":267641,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Working capital.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-02-08T22:50:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marvin German ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":5000,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":416.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":21.85,"local_amount":437.08,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:37:45Z","rounded_local_amount":440.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27092063,"comment":null},{"amount":19.81,"local_amount":396.26,"processed_date":"2009-04-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:36:43Z","rounded_local_amount":399.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35985445,"comment":null},{"amount":20.83,"local_amount":416.67,"processed_date":"2009-05-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:08:23Z","rounded_local_amount":419.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44446061,"comment":null},{"amount":45.96,"local_amount":919.16,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:41:51Z","rounded_local_amount":926.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52956698,"comment":null},{"amount":16.53,"local_amount":330.85,"processed_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T15:25:47Z","rounded_local_amount":333.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73599724,"comment":null},{"amount":20.83,"local_amount":416.67,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T15:32:03Z","rounded_local_amount":419.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73599725,"comment":null},{"amount":20.83,"local_amount":416.67,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T17:58:58Z","rounded_local_amount":419.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87035614,"comment":null},{"amount":83.36,"local_amount":1666.64,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T21:41:07Z","rounded_local_amount":1679.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96948017,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-02-09T04:22:57Z","paid_date":"2009-11-15T21:41:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":87795,"name":"Abena","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Abena D. is fifty years old.

She is requesting this loan to bolster this business. She intends to buy only sacks of onions. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":267663,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"purchasing 65 sacks of onions","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Cotonou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.35 2.433333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2009-02-06T17:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":350000,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":35000},{"due_date":"2009-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":35000},{"due_date":"2009-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":35000},{"due_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":35000},{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":35000},{"due_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":35000},{"due_date":"2009-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":35000},{"due_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":35000},{"due_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":35000},{"due_date":"2009-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":35000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":70,"local_amount":35000,"processed_date":"2009-03-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:31:13Z","rounded_local_amount":35902.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27047011,"comment":null},{"amount":140,"local_amount":70000,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T10:19:07Z","rounded_local_amount":71804.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35938615,"comment":null},{"amount":70,"local_amount":35000,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:48:17Z","rounded_local_amount":35902.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44396252,"comment":null},{"amount":70,"local_amount":35000,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T17:08:53Z","rounded_local_amount":35902.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52904136,"comment":null},{"amount":70,"local_amount":35000,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-20T07:44:41Z","rounded_local_amount":35902.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63126160,"comment":null},{"amount":70,"local_amount":35000,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T10:52:26Z","rounded_local_amount":35902.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73549589,"comment":null},{"amount":70,"local_amount":35000,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T11:13:23Z","rounded_local_amount":35902.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86983379,"comment":null},{"amount":70,"local_amount":35000,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T12:08:21Z","rounded_local_amount":35902.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96895755,"comment":null},{"amount":70,"local_amount":35000,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T11:09:29Z","rounded_local_amount":35902.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103735351,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-02-07T07:15:07Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T11:09:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":87809,"name":"Betty","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Greetings from Betty U.  in Rwezamenyo Sector, Nyarugenge District, Kigali (capital of Rwanda)!

In the future, she hopes to also have the assistance of her daughter who will also study cosmetology; this will allow her to expand the shop and put up a new store in the market to sell clothing.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Scott Crandall, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":267677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"Purchase of athletic clothing to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2009-02-08T23:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Noemi Marcelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":100,"loan_amount":100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:06:37Z","rounded_local_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20393198,"comment":null},{"amount":0.25,"local_amount":0.25,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-02T08:03:46Z","rounded_local_amount":0.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44439227,"comment":null},{"amount":24.75,"local_amount":24.75,"processed_date":"2009-07-01T06:59:59Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:06:46Z","rounded_local_amount":24.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52949944,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-02-09T00:28:55Z","paid_date":"2009-07-15T20:06:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":87822,"name":"Gilbert","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"\t\t            \r\nGilbert N. is married to Mary and blessed with seven children.

N. is a carpenter by profession and he will be investing his loan in furniture; selling of planks, making chairs, cupboards, tables, beds and other item from wood. His business will succeed because he has been doing this particular trade for some time in his community.

For now, however, Martha is saving her part of their money as much as possible so that she can eventually purchase a sewing machine and set up a dressmaking shop in their home.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Christopher Knutson, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":267700,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchasing beauty products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2009-02-13T22:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Martha ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":100,"loan_amount":100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:06:15Z","rounded_local_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20393201,"comment":null},{"amount":0.25,"local_amount":0.25,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-22T07:41:49Z","rounded_local_amount":0.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44439230,"comment":null},{"amount":24.75,"local_amount":24.75,"processed_date":"2009-07-01T06:59:59Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:06:42Z","rounded_local_amount":24.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52949947,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-02-14T01:23:50Z","paid_date":"2009-07-15T20:06:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":87833,"name":"Attaa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Attaa A. is 34 years old.

She saw the outskirts develop, and has had a restaurant, well known and appreciated by the district, for eight years. The restaurant is called La Esquina del Sabor. She has not always owned her restaurant. Before she opened her restaurant she had a beauty salon, but had to leave because she fell sick. Once she returned to work she began selling food. She chose this type of work because she couldn't leave her seven and eight year old daughters alone. She began selling filled potatoes and tamales to the neighborhood on Sundays. Because of the good seasoning of her food, her business has grown. At her age of fifty, Yolanda is now separated from her husband. Nevertheless, she now has a good restaurant and two daughters, who are now older, one of which is working as a teacher. Yolanda has received loans from EDAPROSPO since almost two years ago, and the profits of her business are invested in the improvement of the kitchen of her restaurant and her home. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lois Parshley, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":267808,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"Operaci\u00f3n de su hija menor y techado de su casa","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2009-02-11T06:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yolanda Felicita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":470,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":118.75},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":118.75},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.75},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":353.72,"local_amount":350,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:06:33Z","rounded_local_amount":353.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20393213,"comment":null},{"amount":2.52,"local_amount":2.5,"processed_date":"2009-04-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-29T08:17:11Z","rounded_local_amount":2.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35978361,"comment":null},{"amount":5.02,"local_amount":4.97,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-25T07:45:48Z","rounded_local_amount":5.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44439242,"comment":null},{"amount":113.74,"local_amount":112.53,"processed_date":"2009-07-01T06:59:59Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:06:43Z","rounded_local_amount":113.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52949953,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-02-11T14:26:52Z","paid_date":"2009-07-15T20:06:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":87888,"name":"Adjoavi","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"A.

Of course, she also wants to improve her business so that it will become stable. \r\n<p>\r\nHaving her happy and loving family, Sylvia seems to be already fulfilled with her life but according to her, nothing is permanent in life. Thus, she must strive harder and look for better opportunities that will improve her family's life.  One of these opportunities is to venture into businesses which will guarantee more income opportunities. \r\n<p>\r\nAt 49, Sylvia is more attentive than when she was younger. She is married to Lucas, who is not only her partner in life but also her business partner. Their children are Reynaldo, who is 29 years old and who did not graduate from college, and Nomar, who is 25 years old and a nursing graduate but who is unemployed due to lack of employment

Her small, happy and organized family serves as Vicky's motivation to work harder in order to attain success. \r\n<p>\r\nVicky runs a smoked fish vending business. She is requesting a loan of $100 to expand this business.  She will buy different varieties of vegetables, meats, and snacks at wholesale prices in the public market, which is far from her village.  It does not matter to her even when she needs to ride a passenger jeep (which is rarely available) in order to reach the public market because the price there is cheaper.  She has to sacrifice for the sake of her family.\r\n<p>\r\nFrom her daily income, Vicky wants to save for the future education of her daughter.

Aside from retailing vegetables, Visitacion also ventures into selling secondhand ready-to-wear clothes to generate more income so that she may be able to meet all her family's needs. \r\n<p>\r\nShe is doing her best because she really wants to support the education of her children, who will soon enter college. She prays hard that her loan request will be granted  for the sake of her children who are studying well to achieve their ambitions in life. \r\n<p>\r\nVisitacion is 39 years old and married to Florendo, who is 45 years old and involved in farming activities. They are blessed with three children: Mark Jeffrey, who is 16 years old and a high school senior; Florendo Jr., who is 12 years old and in the last grade of elementary school; and Claris Jane, who is 9 years old and in grade three. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":262811,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Estelita happily shared that her family is bonded with love and that they live harmoniously. \r\n<p>\r\nEstelita wants a loan of $150 to finance their passenger tricycle's daily operation since it is their only daily source of income while they are waiting for the harvest season. Some of the loan will also be used to provide for their needed farming inputs. Their tricycle is being operated alternately by her two sons Ernesto and Enrico. \r\n<p>\r\nEstelita is so thankful that her children are very responsible, although they have no interest in pursuing their studies any more.  At times, Estelita envies her neighbors whose children were able to finish college and had the chance to seek better jobs, unlike her children, who just settled in their simple life.\r\n<p>\r\nEselita believes in the golden rule, \u201cDon\u2019t do unto others what you do not want others do unto you.\u201d Therefore, Estelita said, she must always be friendly and should maintain her good relationships to her neighbors and fellow men in the village. \r\n

B. is a vinegar and soy sauce manufacturer in the village of Barangay Lapogan Tumauini, Isabela. This is a business initiated by her daughter, who has just gotten married. She continues the business to earn additional income aside from farming to sustain her family's needs. \r\n<p>\r\nConcepcion is 55 years old and married to Juanito Basili, a farmer who was formerly a community councilor. They have six children: Nick is 35 years old, married, and a high school graduate; Nedy is 31 years old, married, and a college graduate; Novie is 30 years old, also married, and a computer engineering graduate; Nomar is 27 years old and a college graduate too; Nida is 25 years old and the only one who did not finish college; and the youngest, Norie Ann, is 21 years old and in the fourth year of college. \r\n<p>\r\nConcepcion is proud that their children are now enjoying a good life despite the hardships the family has encountered, especially during the time when all her children were still studying. Concepcion is not selfish so she did not prevent her children from marrying, reasoning that they are educated enough to decide what they need to do or not do. \r\n<p>\r\nNow, Concepcion still strives to support her youngest child in finishing her last year in college. She hopes to increase her daily income from her vinegar and soy sauce manufacturing and vending business in order to sustain their family's needs.  Thus, she hopes to get a loan of $150, which will serve as her additional capital. She also wishes to attend trainings in the future to improve her business.  These include product development, packaging and labeling, since she is not using any business name yet.

Salomen came to know about GHAPE in the year 2003 after encountering some challenges in life such as ill health, death of relatives, and poverty. In order to overcome these challenges, Salomen received her first loan in the year she came to know of GHAPE in the amount of 20,000 frs; she received a loan of 60,000 frs in the year 2004, 80,000 frs in the year 2005, and 150,000 frs in the year 2007. The repayment of the various loans was done promptly.<P>\r\n\r\nGiven her present loan, she plans to rent a plot for cultivation for 100,000 frs; 50,000 frs will be used for the purchase of seeds, and 50,000 frs will be used for the purchase of fertilizer. She will commence repayment on the fourth month from the day of disbursement. This  business will help her community by providing food for them, and many of them will buy from her. With the profit from the loan, she plans to give sound education to her children, complete her house, and bring her daughter  who has been sick for a long period of time to the hospital. She prefers to receive a loan from GHAPE  because of the social training GHAPE  offers, and the issue of collateral security is not a problem.<P>\r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instills a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.  \r\n

is married to Fanka Gabriel and they have 4 children all below 15 years of age. E. is living with her entire family in a house of 3 sleeping rooms and one sitting room. E. has faced so many challenges in life such as the death of her parents, school dropout and family problems. These problems made life unpleasant to E. until the year 2006 in which she came to the knowledge of GHAPE and became a member. E. obtained her first loan from GHAPE in the year 2006, which was 20,000 FRS, and received 150,000 FRS in the year 2008; the repayments were made promptly.<p>\r\n\r\nWith a loan of 250,000 FRS, E. plans to buy more yams for 100,000 FRS, plantain and cocoyam for 100,000 FRS, and fruits and vegetables like pineapples, carrots, and bananas for 50,000 FRS. <p>\r\n\r\nE. greatly believes the business will progress because of the experience she has had in the business and the high demand for her goods. With this business, E. helps her community by supplying food to them, reducing their need to travel to the market and even increasing the economic status of her community. She plans to use the profit from the loan to pay for her children's school fees and to feed and clothe her children. Her repayments will commence in the fourth month from the day of disbursement.<p>\r\n\r\nShe prefers to receive loans from GHAPE because of the training GHAPE offers before disbursing loans, the proper follow up that is done when the loan is repaid, and the comfortable method of repayments. <p>\r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon. GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach. Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values. Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.

is married to  Gideon M. and they are blessed with seven children, none  of them below 15 years of age.  Mary is living in a house with 6 sleeping rooms and one sitting room with her entire family. Mary has been a very hard-working woman during her whole life just to sustain her family. In the cause of hard work, Mary encountered some challenges in life such as the death of her son, of other relatives, and poor health. These challenges made life miserable for Mary until the year 2007 when she discovered GHAPE as a source of relief and became a member.<P>\r\n\r\nIn that same year of 2007, Mary received her pioneer loan of 40,000 FRS CFA and the repayment was made promptly. If she receives this loan, she plans to rent farmland for cultivation for 50,000 FRS, purchase seedlings, manure, fertilizer for 75,000 FRS, and 25,000FRS will be used to hire laborers to work in the farm.\tMary is convinced the business will progress because of the experience she has had in farm work. Furthermore, she is commonly known in her locality as a main supplier of these goods, and she is considered trustworthy by the members of her community.<P>\r\n\r\nThe farm work that Mary  does will  help her community by reducing  their distance to the market in order to buy what she is supplying. Mary plans to use the profit from her loan to pay her children's school fees, feed them, and to take of their medical fees if they are sick and taken to the hospital. Mary prefers to receive a loan from GHAPE because of the trust she has in GHAPE; the method of repayment is comfortable and convenient. <P> \r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instills a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.

F., born in 1963, is married and blessed with four children. He has been a hard-working boy from childhood when he got a job. This job was very short since he was sacked from the job without any fault of his. He also lost his brother who usually supported him in paying school fees and the basic needs of the family. With these drawbacks in life, poverty set in as he now was really unable to maintain the living standards of the family. He then moved to a little two-room house. The school for the children was changed which made them trek very long distances as they even became sick and expenses grew. Faced with these difficulties, his luck changed when his friend introduced him to GHAPE in 2008 were he got his first loan of 400,000 frs which he finished  paying back. He is now asking for a loan which he will use to purchase newspapers, firewood, and piglets.<P>\r\n\r\nHe knows the business will succeed since his community is in need of firewood for cooking and also the pigs will provide pork and  the  pig manure will be used to improve land to farm food crops and vegetables to the community. <P>\r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instills a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.

was married but his wife recently died, leaving behind six children, of whom three are below 15 years of age. Being a hard-working man, he has faced some challenges in life such as ill health, poverty and the death of his wife.<P>\r\n\r\nThese problems made life difficult for him until the year 2006 in which he came to know of GHAPE and enrolled himself. In that same year, Christopher received his fist loan of 20,000 FRS; he received a loan of 35,000 in the year 2007, and 100,000 FRS in the year 2008. Christopher was able to make all repayments of his previous loans promptly.<P>\r\n\r\nGiven this loan, he plans to buy vegetable seeds, a sprayer, and insecticide for the vegetable. This business will help the community by providing fresh vegetables for them. Christopher plans to use the profit from the loan to pay his children's school fees and give them good food. He will start repayment on the fourth month from the day of disbursement. Christopher prefers to receive a loan from GHAPE because the method of repayment is comfortable and convenient.   <P>\r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instills a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.

This has made Unice very worried when she sees her friends doing well.  In the cause of hard work, she encountered some challenges in life such as the death of her father and poor health. These challenges made life miserable for her until the year 2007 when she discovered GHAPE as a source of relief and became a member.<P>\r\n\r\nIn that same year of 2007, she received her pioneer loan of 40,000 FRS CFA and the repayment was made promptly.

She is convinced the business will progress because of the experience she has in the business and because she is considered trustworthy by the members in her community.

They do their buying at the big open-air market of  S\u00e9gou and sometimes buy rice in the stores of S\u00e9gou Coura. The 1600 yards of plastic fiber will be woven into nets on which \"senis\" and \"fon fons\" (floats?) are affixed.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This is how the group members became part of the loan program of the micro-credit institution Soro Yiriwaso, with which they are now on their eighth group loan.  The first seven loans have been repaid without difficulty.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis new loan will be used to buy:  50 <i>pagnes<i> (lengths of colorful West African cloth) made of cotton (kol\u00e8ba); the supplies for making <i>bogolan<i> the mud cloth of Mali: 1 sack of <i>n\u2019galama<i>, 1 sack of wild grape skins, a tub of black clay, laundry soap both powdered and in cakes; 13 lengths of WAX brand <i>pagnes<i>; and the ingredients for incense: <i>magnon kiss\u00e8ni<i>, an exotic plant, <i>n\u2019gu\u00e9ni<i> seeds, and 20 bottles of perfume.  \r\n<p>\r\nTo dye <i>pagne<i> cloth, designs are drawn with a mixture of clay and powdered soap that is then wetted in a concoction of <i>n\u2019galama<i> and wild grapes.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <p> \r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They purchase fresh milk in their village, as well as in Kamakono, a village located 3 kilometers away. Millets is obtained from their daily work during harvest season in the men's fields, as well as at the weekly fair at the grand market in S\u00e9gou.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <p> \r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p> \r\n\r\nIMON's History<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <p> \r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

They essentially raise livestock and sell milk and milk products.  \r\n<p>\r\nAfter having correctly repaid their first two loans, this group is on its third group loan, which will be use to buy 85 sacks of milled seeds and two sacks of rice.  Supplies are gotten at the weekly fair at the grand marketplace of S\u00e9gou (at the vendors\u2019 square of Niono).  The milled seeds are used to feed their milk cows during the dry season;  also used are the winnowing remains from processing peanuts and black-eyed peas, fodder, and millet bran.  The milled seeds enable the increased production of milk, which is sold, fresh or curdled, and door-to-door in the S\u00e9gou area.  The rice is sold in the village and at the M\u00e9dine marketplace of S\u00e9gou.  These sales are made at the retail level, cash or credit accepted, to a diverse customer base.  \r\n<p>\r\nThe group members plan on realizing an average monthly profit of 33,000 francs CFA that will be used for repaying the loan interest, buying some milled seeds, and addressing the needs of the children (clothing and medical costs).  Their main objective is to increase their working capital, which generates income that will be used to buy milk cows.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1425,"image":{"id":269002,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Milk Sales","sector":"Food","use":"To buy milled seeds and some rice ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Segou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14 -6","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-03-02T17:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariam                              ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Fatoumata           ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bata                      ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata             ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Kadiatou               ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadia           ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mantini\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Assan           ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamou        ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":720000,"loan_amount":1425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":120000},{"due_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":120000},{"due_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":120000},{"due_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":120000},{"due_date":"2009-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":120000},{"due_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":120000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":237.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":237.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":237.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":237.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":237.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":237.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":237.5,"local_amount":120000,"processed_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:07:58Z","rounded_local_amount":120234.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135822,"comment":null},{"amount":237.49,"local_amount":120000,"processed_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:28:16Z","rounded_local_amount":120234.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033621,"comment":null},{"amount":237.5,"local_amount":120000,"processed_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:38:45Z","rounded_local_amount":120234.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44620989,"comment":null},{"amount":237.5,"local_amount":120000,"processed_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:21:21Z","rounded_local_amount":120234.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53019954,"comment":null},{"amount":237.51,"local_amount":120000,"processed_date":"2009-07-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:18:58Z","rounded_local_amount":120234.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242699,"comment":null},{"amount":237.5,"local_amount":120000,"processed_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:42:22Z","rounded_local_amount":120234.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678207,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-03-03T06:18:20Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T22:42:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":88070,"name":"Alex","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alex is 40-years-old and is married with four children.

She has been in this business for about five years. Currently, Yaa needs a loan to buy tubers of yam in bulk in order to cut down on cost that she otherwise incurs as a result of the frequent trips to procure the yam tubers.

Susana's family lives in a rented apartment in Koforidua, a small commercial and farming community located near Offinso in the Ashanti Region of Ghana. Susana works very hard to help her husband financially support their family. She earns income trading banana and oranges, which is a business run by many women in the community. Susana buys bags of oranges and unripe banana from farmers in the nearby villages, stores the banana to ripe and then sells it to retailers in the local market. She has been in this business for ten years and has always dreamed of saving enough money to support her children in school. She is therefore asking for a loan to buy banana and oranges in bulk to be able to increase her business profit

Thomas. As a widow, Beatrice has four children, two of whom need to be cared for as they are below the age of fifteen. Life was very not easy for her when her husband died, and her child was involved in an accident. In the year 2003, Beatrice came to know of GHAPE and enrolled herself, so that she could obtain a loan and continue with her business, from which she raises money to pay school fees and provide food for her children.\r\n\r\nGiven a loan, she plans to buy corn for \u201ccorn beer\u201d production (\u201ccorn beer\u201d is one of the most common drinks in the NW region of Cameroon). It is produced from ground corn, palm wine, and palm oil. She is very convinced the business will progress, because she has been doing the same business for a very long time, has a good business site and many customers. Furthermore, she was trained in business management, marketing techniques, and credit discipline and has showed commitment in investing and repaying her loans. She promises to make her repayments on time. These activities of Beatrice will help her community by providing them with food and drink for their social activities, at a moderate cost. She plans to raise money to invest in an additional line of business, buy food, and pay school fees for her children from the proceeds of the business.\r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon. GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach. Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values. Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement. GHAPE instils a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":269075,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase corn for corn beer, as well as palm oil and palm wine.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Ntaghem, Bamenda, NW.

She entered school to enroll in the university for education, but her husband did not permit her to study or work because he said that women should be in the house to care for children.  This is how she spent her life until her husband allowed her to work from home.  For seven years, she has had a business that sells fritters and also starters, such as stuffed potato and causa.  Since she has been with Fina, she has received loans that have helped her greatly to succeed in her business.  With Bancomunal, the time that passes is beautiful, and she relaxes.

member of the Medalla Milagrosa ('Miraculous Medal') community bank.  He is from the department of San Mart\u00edn, 23-years old and single.  At the age of 3 his mother moved him to Lima, where he studied until finishing high school.  Since he was 15 Meyer has worked with his mother as a street vendor, working from 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. selling ice cream, and from 6:00 to 10:00 p.m. selling candy and roasted bean snacks.  \r\n\r\nMeyer suffers from health problems; when he was 12 he dislocated his knee playing soccer and didn't have the money to seek medical attention.  As a result, he gets tired easily and doesn't have much strength in his leg.  Every day he arrives home from work aching.  \r\n\r\nMeyer needs a loan of 1,000 PEN to buy candy, beans, and ice cream.  He has many goals and wants to study automechanics, buy a moto-car, and rent a store to sell groceries.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Vivian Lu, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":269142,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase of candy, roasted beans, and ice cream.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2009-02-12T00:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Meyer Jhasmani","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:26:20Z","rounded_local_amount":263.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20397386,"comment":null},{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:14:07Z","rounded_local_amount":263.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27089091,"comment":null},{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-04-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:06:04Z","rounded_local_amount":263.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35982427,"comment":null},{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-05-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T22:52:18Z","rounded_local_amount":263.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44442956,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-02-12T15:07:35Z","paid_date":"2009-06-15T22:52:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}}]}
