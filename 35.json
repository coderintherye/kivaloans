Chipas are a traditional food, much like bread, made with corn starch, cheese, milk, and vegetable oil, that is widely eaten in Paraguay.  She has done this for more than 20 years and she told us that thanks to this work, she and her husband, Sr. Mario Fernandez, were able to give their family a good education and even buy their own house.\r\n<p>\r\nHer main customers are factories where they make chipas and bakeries in the neighborhood; they buy the ingredients\u2014corn starch, cheese, vegetable oil, etc\u2014from her daily.  The San Francisco de Caacupe neighborhood, where she lives, is a prominent area for chipas production which helps her sales, especially on the first days after every weekend.\r\n<p>\r\nIn the months up to December 8, the demand for chipas production is incessant because of the Virgin of Caacupe celebration on that day.  Pilgrims from various parts of the country go to the city of Caacupe to attend the mass at the basilica there.  Sales are very good during this period and the neighborhood hums with activity as everyone in the neighborhood busies themselves making chipas for sale.\r\n<p>\r\nSra.

Por ello la venta es muy buena en esa \u00e9poca y genera un dinamismo en el barrio ya que casi en todas las casas de la ciudad elaboran chipas para vender.<p>\r\nDesea el cr\u00e9dito para comprar m\u00e1s almid\u00f3n, queso, ma\u00edz, porque la demanda de sus productos es bastante alta."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":57609,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"Buy merchandise for sale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PY","country":"Paraguay","town":"Caacupe","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-25.383333 -57.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":58,"posted_date":"2007-09-02T19:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Asunci\u00f3n","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-09-16T21:51:32Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":250,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":41.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":41.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":42,"local_amount":42,"processed_date":"2007-10-03T09:26:55Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-04T18:55:46Z","rounded_local_amount":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":62563,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":42,"local_amount":42,"processed_date":"2007-11-03T10:29:47Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-04T18:55:46Z","rounded_local_amount":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":75945,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":42,"local_amount":42,"processed_date":"2007-12-03T10:31:45Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-04T18:55:46Z","rounded_local_amount":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":90793,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":42,"local_amount":42,"processed_date":"2008-01-03T10:22:10Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-04T18:55:46Z","rounded_local_amount":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":107511,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":82,"local_amount":82,"processed_date":"2008-01-04T18:55:46Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-04T18:55:46Z","rounded_local_amount":82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":108331,"comment":"Prepayment"}],"funded_date":"2007-09-02T21:51:32Z","paid_date":"2008-01-04T18:55:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":17131,"name":"Felicita","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Felicita, 48, is married and has two children.

In the case of the \"pacas\", we are talking of even higher margins than those usually found in the business, as these are pressed bundles of new and used clothing that are sent to poor countries as assistance, but end up being traded in an \"open\" market in this country.

Irma can make 2 <i>huipiles<\/i> in 15 days, and then she sells them in the market in Chimaltenango for about US$65 each.  She'll invest this loan, as she did the previous one, in the yarn she needs for weaving and in embroidery thread. She says that having a bit of capital via the loan just makes things a little easier \u2013 it's not a big problem trying to get money together to buy yarn, which used to be the case. In fact, she still has a little left from her last loan, which is completely paid off. \r\n<p>\r\nIrma's dream is to build a house and buy some land.

Lilian told us that she began sewing more than 20 years ago.  She learned from her mother, who she helps and trades work with.  Lilian is a humble person and a very hard worker, thanks to her efforts and the support from the Fundacion Paraguaya, she has been able to gain independence and establish her own sewing shop where her clients come to request different types of clothing.   Lilian makes wedding dresses, blouses, uniforms, etc. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p> She would like there to be more opportunities for work in her country because the economic situation for most people is more stable.  In this way, they can avoid more people emigrating to other countries in search of work.  Already many of her clients have left for other countries.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p> In recent months, Lilian has received a large quantity of orders, and to be able to complete them she would like to buy thread, fabric, buttons, zippers wholesale, because buying in greater quantities enables her to get better discounts from her suppliers.   To make this happen, she is requesting a loan of $200. <\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLa se\u00f1ora Lilian tiene 36 a\u00f1os, es madre soltera de un hijo var\u00f3n a quien ella brinda todo el amor y cuidados necesarios. \r\nLilian nos cuenta que se inici\u00f3 en el rubro de la costura hace mas de 20 a\u00f1os y lo aprendi\u00f3 de su madre, con quien siempre intercambian trabajos y se ayudan.

Ella realiza vestidos de novias, quincea\u00f1eras, camisas, uniformes, etc. \r\nElla desea que en el pa\u00eds existan m\u00e1s fuentes de trabajo para que la situaci\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica de todos sea m\u00e1s estable de esta forma evitar que la gente emigre a otros pa\u00edses en busca de trabajo, ya que muchos de sus clientes emigraron a otros pa\u00edses.\r\nEn los \u00faltimos meses ha recibido una gran cantidad de trabajos, para poder cumplir con todos desea adquirir telas, hilos, botones y cierres al por mayor ya que comprando en grandes cantidades obtiene mejores descuentos de sus proveedores.

is one of the old members in the Sologa Mulifanua Center. She is on her fifth loan and she is still running her Samoan oil business together with an additional business of weaving fine mats. <p>Although the loan seems big compared to the business, Puaaelo, as mentioned before, also weaves and sells fine mats at very high prices.

is a busy entrepreneur from Zaporoshye, Ukraine. She runs two kiosks where she sells a nice selection of women\u2019s dresses and hats. Married with two children, Alla started her business not long after graduating from college. One of her biggest motivations for operating her business is to provide for the needs of her children.\r\n\r\nShe has had one kiosk for several years at a great location at a market near a train station and manufacturing plant. The market is open late and stays open on weekends, allowing vendors there to earn extra income.

With the blows life was giving her at that time, and in a foreign country, she saw the necessity of returning to Paraguay, to start all over again from zero.\r\n\r\n<p>She started out selling merchandise in the street. At that time she had just one big bag which she carried on her back, going from house to house offering her products. In this way she made working capital and, little by little, with much sacrifice, her business kept growing. She had the chance to buy a new house and in that way raise her 5 children and offer them a good education. Today, she already has a good quantity of customers, and thanks to her effort and the support of her children, she is able to open a small business inside her own home.\r\n\r\n<p>With the loan she is requesting, she plans to expand her stock of merchandise.

Although it seems to be a long name, it really is a commonly used form to name someone in the Dominican Republic, and in general, in Hispanic cultures. Her second last name, \"Del Carmen\", is given after the patron saint \"Del Carmen Virgin\" from the Catholic tradition of having patron \"Mother of God\" who bears different name depending on where it is that it's used as such. It isn't strange to find that this particular \"Virgin\" is popular in the island of Puerto Rico. Insofar as her last name is concerned, the \"D. L.\"  stands for the origins of her ancestors: the Province of \"L.\" in Spain. Her second last name, R., is as common as the name \"Smith\" may be in certain parts of the U.S.A.\r\n<p>\r\nMercedes had 9 children, but today she only has one living with her.  Her husband died some time ago, and now she must care for her recently injured son. He was procuring the food for their plates, but fell from the motorbike on which he gave rides for a living. He is now living with a cast and there\u2019s no certainty as to when or how he will be able to riD. the bike again.

She sells door-to-door for cash and on credit. She also makes clothing for children in \"Ao poi \", a handcrafted fabric with needlework typical of Paraguay, to order. Her clients are teachers, neighbors, business people and on occasion, clients who live in the cities of Luque, Aregu\u00e1 Limpio and San Lorenzo, some 20 km from Dora's home. <p>Dora has been selling jewelry for 3 years; she started her business with the financial help of the Fundaci\u00f3n Paraguay. She and her husband are poor and self-made people with a strong sense of responsibility when it comes to paying their bills and loans.

A  retiree 10 years ago but she did not just stay home and collect pension from the government. All her five children are grown up and they would like very much help their parents financially but Mrs Chi\u00ean does not want to depend on her children. This is why she had contracted a loan from \"Qu\u1ef9 T\u00ecnh th\u01b0\u01a1ng\" organization 10 years ago.  With an small initial loan of only 50 USD, she invested in a small store selling basic goods. Her inventory includes cooking oil, sugar, instant noodle cups ...etc. This not only generates income for her but also provides her a sense of personal satisfaction knowing that she can take care of her self. With the full support from her husband, also a retiree, Mrs Chi\u00ean requests a loan of 200 USD to buy more stock for her store which will in term increase her revenue.   \r\n<p> <b>Translated from Vietnamese by Khang Ho-Si, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nSau khi v\u1ec1 h\u01b0u, ch\u1ecb L\u01b0u Th\u1ecb Chi\u00ean, x\u00e3 H\u01b0ng \u0110\u1ea1o, huy\u1ec7n H\u01b0ng Nguy\u00ean kh\u00f4ng ch\u1ea5p nh\u1eadn vi\u1ec7c ch\u1ec9 ng\u1ed3i nh\u1eadn nh\u1eefng \u0111\u1ed3ng l\u01b0\u01a1ng h\u01b0u c\u1ee7a nh\u00e0 n\u01b0\u1edbc.

Mrs. T. starts loaning money in 1998 with the starting amount of $50 to invest in her butchery business.  After her four children grew up and left home, without any one to help out, she had to change to fish-farming and raising pigs.  Her husband, Mr. Tran Minh Quy, is a disable war veteran but has helped her a lot in both of these businesses.  On average, for every farrow of pig she sells (usually once in every 3 months) she earns a profit of $150.  Currently, Mrs T. is asking for a loan of $825 to invest in her home projects.  This amount of money will be used to buy breeding fish (for $312), breeding pig (for $200) and foodstuff for them (for $312).\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Vietnamese by Anh Hoai Nguyen, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nCh\u1ecb Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb Tuy\u1ebft, 55 tu\u1ed5i s\u1ed1ng c\u00f9ng v\u1edbi ch\u1ed3ng v\u00e0 c\u00f4 con g\u00e1i nu\u00f4i t\u1ea1i x\u00e3 H\u01b0ng \u0110\u1ea1o, huy\u1ec7n H\u01b0ng Nguy\u00ean, Ngh\u1ec7 An. 4 ng\u01b0\u1eddi con l\u1edbn g\u1ed3m 2 trai, 2 g\u00e1i \u0111\u1ec1u \u0111i l\u00e0m \u0103n xa \u00edt c\u00f3 d\u1ecbp v\u1ec1 th\u0103m cha m\u1eb9, ch\u1ecb Tuy\u1ebft m\u1ed9t m\u00ecnh ch\u0103m lo h\u1ea7u h\u1ebft c\u00f4ng vi\u1ec7c trong gia \u0111\u00ecnh.

28 years of age, Mrs. Essi D. is her husband\u2019s third wife and mother of three children. Generally, husbands who have several wives tend to neglect their role as fathers because they are weighted down by too much responsibility for supporting their households. It is thus the women who eke out a living for their children, feeding, clothing, and educating them. Such is the situation that Mrs. D. finds herself in. <P>Fortunately for her children, Essi is a dynamic woman with lots of business activities. Currently, she has opened up a little telephone stand, together with selling shoes and various other products. In order to expand these micro-businesses, Essi is asking for a loan of US$ 1000 which will serve her as business capital. This will allow her to increase her profit and improve living conditions for her family.<P><B>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva volunteer<P><\/b>Ag\u00e9e de 28 ans, Madame D.

45 years of age, Mr. Jean A. is married and has five (5) children and eight (8) additional people in his care. His principal work is the buying and selling of small ruminants. This business requires lots of travel because he needs to go to remote areas where these animals cost less. This necessitates considerable financial means. The business is very profitable, but his lack of capital makes his income insignificant, and living conditions remain difficult in his household. To strengthen his business, he is asking for a loan of $1000 which will serve to buy, transport, and re-sell small ruminants.

He is totally irresponsible and shows almost no concern for the welfare of his children. As a consequence, Mrs. A. lives in extreme poverty and many of her children do not attend school. In order to survive, she generates income from growing cassava. The tuberous roots of cassava are turned into tapioca that she sells at the market. The quality of her product has given her today a large clientele, but she can no longer meet their demand because she does not have enough cassava. To address this situation, she would like to buy some cassava fields to use in her production. She is therefore requesting a business loan of $700 to buy cassava and produce and sell tapioca. This will bring change to her day-to-day life.\r\n<p>\r\nAg\u00e9e de 47 ans, Madame A. Akou est mari\u00e9e et m\u00e8re de huit (8) enfants.  En dehors de ses propres enfants, elle a \u00e0 sa charge quatre (4) autres. Son mari qui n\u2019a aucun emploi fixe a cinq femmes avec une vingtaine d\u2019enfants. Il est totalement irresponsable et ne se soucie gu\u00e8re du bien-\u00eatre des enfants. La cons\u00e9quence est que Madame A. Akou  vit dans une extr\u00eame pauvret\u00e9 et nombre de ses enfants ne vont pas \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole. Pour survivre, elle a comme activit\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9ratrice de revenu la culture du champ de manioc. Les tubercules de manioc sont transform\u00e9s en faine (gari) qu\u2019elle vend sur le march\u00e9. La qualit\u00e9 de son produit fait qu\u2019elle a \u00e0 ce jour une client\u00e8le abondante qu\u2019elle n\u2019arrive plus \u00e0 satisfaire car elle n\u2019a pas suffisamment de manioc. Pour am\u00e9liorer cette situation, elle d\u00e9sire d\u00e9sormais acheter des champs de manioc pour sa production. Elle sollicite \u00e0 cet effet un cr\u00e9dit de $700 qui va lui servir de fonds de commerce pour l\u2019achat de manioc, la fabrication et la vente du gari. Cela apportera un changement dans sa vie de tous les jours.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from French by Sarah Llewellyn, Kiva

BY MATT FLANNERY\r\n<br><br>\r\nMr A. Kossi was born in 1975 in Gati in the prefecture of Zio. After his primary studies, he obtained a car  driving licence. Not having the means to buy a car, he completed 5 years of farming after that.   Married and father of two children, his wife does not have any income generating activity  -- with the result that all the needs are all supported by Mr A.. From his farming business, the family performs well -- it is responsible for the family's survival. \r\n<br><br>\r\nHe is honest and rigorous,  In order to have his own motor-driven pump, he requests a loan of $1000. He will be able to thus increase the farm's cultivable surface for an increase in its profits. This will be able to thus provide even more suitably for the needs of the family.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nORIGINAL FRENCH\r\n<br><br>\r\nMonsieur A.

This loan will help H. become a self reliant person who is also able to meet all his family's living expenses."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":60677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","use":"Puchase of a small taxi vehicle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Wandegeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.35 33.55","type":"point"}},"partner_id":37,"posted_date":"2007-09-05T15:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sekibuule","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-09-19T18:54:07Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2007-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2007-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2008-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2008-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2008-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2008-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2008-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":150}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2007-10-19T09:23:14Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-25T12:26:04Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":69491,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2007-11-19T10:25:48Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-25T12:26:04Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":83671,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2007-12-19T10:26:10Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-25T12:26:04Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":99426,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2008-01-19T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-25T12:26:04Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118138,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2008-02-19T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-25T12:26:04Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":138221,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2008-03-19T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-25T12:26:04Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":161208,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2008-04-30T11:53:08Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-25T12:26:04Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":197132,"comment":null},{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2008-07-25T12:26:04Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-25T12:26:04Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":277280,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2007-09-05T18:54:07Z","paid_date":"2008-07-25T12:26:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":17616,"name":"Elshan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elshan has 10 years of experience in this business.
