There are many designers, who are generators of ideas and low-level seamstresses, who execute the intended idea. However, very often both sides face misunderstandings which are caused by the absence of a middle linkage between them. The industry is in need of mid-level employees who would interpret top designers' ideas into small tasks for seamstresses. \r\n\r\nZoya, 53, is the leader of this group. She is one of those linkage employees who are critically important for any business. Zoya is married and has been providing private sewing and designing services for two years. She acquired these skills while working for a local fashion house. Her business was started with the purchase of a sewing machine for 10,000 soms. This equipment is Zoya's main asset and helps create hundreds of looks. A monthly profit is around 6,000 soms (~$135); however, a very small part of it is saved for the purchase of additional equipment. Zoya would like to use the loan for the purchase of a new type of sewing machine that would definitely improve the quality of her clothing. \r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\t\r\n This loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\n MBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She also sells cooked rice with sauce, pasta, etc. She buys her supplies in B\u00e9nin. She has been working at this businss for a dozen years, and it allows her to cover her family's daily expenses. This first loan will surely permit  Laure S\u00e8blo and the other members of the FIFONSI group to raise the level of their businesses and grow their turnover and their clientele. \r\n\r\nLater on, Laure S\u00e8blo would like to acquire a parcel of land and build a house.

One of his clients suggested that he move his business from the market to a store where his goods do not get worn out and beaten up, and so he did.  Vladimir has a spacious shop in a convenient place on a main thoroughfare. In the city, very few people sell such an assortment and quantity of sportswear. In the shop there is an air conditioner, TV, air ionizer, and good lighting. Additionally, there is a great deal of opportunity to pay attention to every single customer.  \r\n\r\nVladimir has been selling clothes for seven years. He makes 27,000 hryvnias. Vladimir regularly buys new goods to maintain his inventory.  The more variety he has, the more he can profit.  Vladimir plans to use his 17,500 hryvnia loan to buy track suits, shorts, T-shirts, tennis shoes, and deck shoes. He knows that sportswear promotes a more healthy way of life for youth since many buy clothes for jogging, working in gyms, and skiing. Vladimir plans to expand his shop to display and sell more goods.   \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2200,"image":{"id":819816,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":" to buy track suits, shorts, T-shirts, tennis shoes, and deck shoes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UA","country":"Ukraine","town":"Nikopol","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"47.566667 34.4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":26,"posted_date":"2011-07-21T15:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vladimir","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UAH","disbursal_amount":17500,"loan_amount":2200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2916},{"due_date":"2011-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2916},{"due_date":"2011-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2916},{"due_date":"2011-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2916},{"due_date":"2011-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":2916},{"due_date":"2011-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":2920}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":366.58},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":366.59},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":366.58},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":366.58},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":366.58},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":367.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":366.58,"local_amount":2916,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-16T08:09:09Z","rounded_local_amount":2929.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221700237,"comment":null},{"amount":366.59,"local_amount":2916,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T09:36:10Z","rounded_local_amount":2929.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227070069,"comment":null},{"amount":366.58,"local_amount":2916,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-16T08:05:07Z","rounded_local_amount":2929.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232975128,"comment":null},{"amount":366.58,"local_amount":2916,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:37:07Z","rounded_local_amount":2929.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238642546,"comment":null},{"amount":733.67,"local_amount":5836,"processed_date":"2011-11-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:15:07Z","rounded_local_amount":5863.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244596975,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-07-30T02:15:07Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T10:15:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":319845,"name":"Florence","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Florence is engaged in the business of selling second-hand clothes.

Armen lives in Yerevan with his mother, who is jobless. \r\nAfter serving in the Armenian Army, he worked in the trading sector for several years.

Armen constructed his rolling device by himself and he set up his business with a relative of his. But six months ago, his relative left Armenia, and now Armen carries on his business alone. \r\nArmen buys tin foil from an Armenian factory and Chinese-produced plastic wrap from a wholesale fair. Recently, Armen received an offer for Chinese tin foil purchasing, but he rejected that proposal as he prefers to work with domestic manufacturers. \r\nArmen sells his tin foil and plastic wrap to supermarkets and corner stores. He uses the profit from the business for his family. \r\nArmen is seeking a loan of 700,000 AMD to buy raw materials for his business. The supermarkets pay Armen 90 days after shipment, so this loan will help him cover the cost of raw materials.

Rezo rakes his fields for hours. He will store the collected grass and use it in the winter for feeding the cows. Once he has his own raking equipment, he won\u2019t have to rent it from neighboring farmers.

is 41 years old and lives on the outskirts of the city of Ibarra in northern Ecuador. He is married and lives with his wife and his children. Luis is a father of four children aged 16, 15, 10, and 8 years old, respectively. Luis is a hardworking man who takes responsibility for his family. He is a man of good character. Luis' business is selling animals, especially pigs, guinea pigs, and cattle at the market. He began this business when he married over 20 years ago. Luis began by selling animals to his neighbors. Now, 20 years later, he uses micro loans to more easily obtain the capital necessary to purchase animals to sell at a profit. Earlier in the history of his business, he used to obtain his capital from loan sharks who charged him daily for their money-lending services. Luis works with his wife, who is pictured beside him in the photo. Luis reports that his business is going well and with the earnings he sees, he invests in the education of his children. His loan will be used to purchase more pigs. His past loans have given him the opportunity to buy his animals, pay a low interest rate, and get his loan quickly so he could get to work. Luis\u2019 dream is to build a new house on new land in the next year. He wants to continue his work with his business and support his family.\r\n\r\nIn the photo, Luis and his wife are pictured with their guinea pigs, as Luis had not yet had the opportunity to purchase the pigs that this loan will finance.

She makes maternity clothes, an activity she began 4 years ago when she was working as a sales assistant in a shop selling dressmaking supplies. From there was born the idea of becoming independent and starting her own business venture. She installed herself in a location, which her husband staffed for over a year while Socorro trained in design and sewing with the National Learning Service. The National Learning Service is an institution which invests in the social and technical skills development of the Colombian workforce, providing free professional training courses to support people's development in activities which contribute to the social, economic and technological development of the country.\r\n\r\nOnce she had learned her trade this way, Socorro focused on the line of maternity wear that she still sells in her shop today. Her Kiva loan is the first finance she has had from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, and with it she will buy materials and supplies for dressmaking, because she is bringing out new collections to please her customers. Her aim is to consolidate her store in the north of the city, and to build it up over time into a source of income and employment for her family. Her greatest challenge is securing her position in the market, because the competition is stiff and, because her clothes are of very good quality, her costs are high. While she works to achieve her dreams she is working at a profit of no less than 48%, and every day she works to ensure this is stable and even to improve on it."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":819214,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"To buy materials and supplies for dressmaking.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-08-01T07:01:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Socorro","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1070000,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":170661},{"due_date":"2011-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":173249},{"due_date":"2011-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":176569},{"due_date":"2011-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":179954},{"due_date":"2011-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":183403},{"due_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":186164}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.69},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.19},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103.14},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.11},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.13},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.74}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":99.69,"local_amount":170661,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:02:21Z","rounded_local_amount":175445.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227320516,"comment":null},{"amount":101.19,"local_amount":173249,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:05:20Z","rounded_local_amount":178106.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232803641,"comment":null},{"amount":103.14,"local_amount":176569,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:18:29Z","rounded_local_amount":181519.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238614722,"comment":null},{"amount":105.11,"local_amount":179954,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-25T08:51:45Z","rounded_local_amount":184999.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244568675,"comment":null},{"amount":107.13,"local_amount":183403,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:07:55Z","rounded_local_amount":188545.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250780011,"comment":null},{"amount":108.74,"local_amount":186164,"processed_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:19:38Z","rounded_local_amount":191383.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257188404,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-08-03T15:51:52Z","paid_date":"2012-02-15T10:19:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":320013,"name":"Erminia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Erminia es una mujer alegre y trabajadora de 40 a\u00f1os de edad, es madre de familia y vive en casa propia con sus 3 hijos y esposo, que la apoya en sus actividades.

She goes out every day to sell products such as rucksacks, sheets, handbags, perfumes, toiletries, socks and other goods. The loan that she is requesting is for the purchase of these products, as having them will show to her clients that she has a large variety of merchandise. Her dream is to see her son grow up and to continue supporting him in his education.

She lives in her own home with her partner Sabino, 49, and their 3 beloved children: Ely, Roly and Dina, who are 19, 16 and 14 years old, respectively.  What she wants most is to provide her children with a good education, and to do this she is prepared to work arduously.  In Saragoza's life, the green fields of the village of Triboline, located in the rainforest in the department of Ayacucho, have been a very agreeable place to work.  Ever since she was very young her parents taught her this work, and now she has her own fields where she works with a lot of care and sacrifice.  Her cocoa, coffee and banana crops are grown over a total of 3 hectares of her land.  What she likes most about her work is harvesting the fields, since in this way she feels that the months of hard work are compensated by her quality crops.  She has been farming for 20 years, and what she considers most difficult is transporting her crops from her community to the collection centers located in the city of Sivia.  With the loan she requests, she will buy materials to do some work on her house.  Over time she hopes to save enough money to buy new lands so that later her beloved children can inherit them.

Most of the locals work in farming and commerce.\r\n\r\nThis is a group of people who decided to come together and form a loan group which will be very helpful to them since they will use their loans to improve their small businesses.  They work in different activities such as farming, livestock raising, commerce, selling meals, etc.\r\n\r\nHere we meet Mayra who is married and has a 6 year-old son who is in his first year of elementary school.  Her husband is a driver.  Mayra completed her higher education.\r\n\r\nIn spite of having a degree, Mayra does not have a job where she can put her knowledge into practice.  For this reason, some time ago, making the most of a plot of land that she has in the countryside, she started raising livestock.  She built a small farm where she raises pigs.
