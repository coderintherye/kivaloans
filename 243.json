David entered the world of micro-business in 1993. He would go from village to village bartering salted fish and soap for bags of cassava and corn, which he then sold in Kinshasa. This business supported him while he finished his high school studies in 1998. After the company where he was working closed in 2002, David once again took up bartering in different villages until he opened his own telephone booth in Kinshasa in 2002 using the profits he had accumulated. He plans to use the next loan from Hope to buy prepaid phone cards and sell them in order to increase the income from his business, which provides him with a weekly profit of $35. His ambition is to open a pharmacy, given the increasing need for medicines. David is 36 years old, married and the father of four children aged between two and eight. Two of the children are at primary school.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Sarah Llewellyn, Kiva

Using her house as a base, Nemesi plans to use this loan to expand her business of selling wallets, purses, shoes, and skirts. The capital, Santo Domingo, is about an hour away from her home in Los Alcarrizos and Nemesi plans to make bimonthly trips there to purchase her merchandise for the best price. \r\n\r\nNot only is Nemesi excited about expanding her business efforts, but she is also excited about the responsibilities associated with being a group coordinator. Esperanza International uses the Grameen model of group lending. This means that if one member in the group defaults, the other members are responsible for this portion too. Thus, it is important the group maintains a sense of solidarity and actively works through problems together. Nemesi is eager to help facilitate these conversations and unity. She described \u201csolidarity\u201d as a little word that has great meaning; that it means a group commitment to helping one another mutually attain goals and overcome obstacles. \r\n\r\n\r\nOn

Her eldest child is still studying in college and her youngest is a computer programming undergraduate who works as a computer programmer and a sales boy in a private computer shop in town. Her husband has been her partner for life in the business. Rodolfo is the one that managed the business and Rita manages their finances.\r\n<p>\r\nRita joined ASHI in 1999 because she wished to have her own business. Through ASHI she was able to acquire capital to start up a business which she and her husband chose. Rita\u2019s husband is skilled and well experienced in repairing and vulcanizing vehicle tires, therefore Rita thought that doing this kind of business would not require any more training. As years went on, Rita\u2019s loan in ASHI grew from Php5,000 to Php30,000 in her most recent loan. She expanded her business as well, however, it is not as big as she expects and is not earning as much as she imagined due to frequent electric power interruptions. There were times when the interruption lasted for several weeks, especially when there is a typhoon.\r\n<p>\r\nRita knew that only if they have their own electric generator, can their business continue its operation even if the whole town suffers from electric power interruption. Hence, Rita applied for a loan from ASHI. After using the generator and seeing improvements in her business income generation, Rita will borrow a bigger amount to improve their vulcanizing shop and purchase more necessary machines for the business. Rita also wants to have more supplies of vehicle tires to sell to her customers.\r\n<p>\r\nAside from Rita\u2019s business managed by her husband, she is also into a buy and sell business. This is how she makes her weekly payments for her loan from ASHI. Rita is so much happy to have her own business to run and a business that her family is having. She hopes that her vulcanizing shop will grow further and will be successful for this has been her family\u2019s cup of tea and bread for long

He also grows alfalfa, which he sells in his town\u2019s plaza.  Concurrently, he leases sections of his farmlands to neighbors, which generates additional income.  Isael takes advantage of the fact that there is less work to be done during his crops\u2019 planting and growing stages by offering his services as a construction worker.  In the near future, he would like to acquire more land to continue planting alfalfa and increase his sales.  This is the first time he takes a loan with MFP as well as his first experience working with a cooperative bank.  His promise is to work collaboratively to help his group progress.  The funds that he requests will be destined for purchasing fertilizers and to make improvements to some of the structures of his home. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":350490,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy fertilizers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-07-12T13:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Isael","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":275,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:23Z","rounded_local_amount":825.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717179,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-07-12T22:37:48Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":121230,"name":"Susan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Susan M. is a 46-year-old woman and is a single parent of four children.

She joined ASHI in 1999 and the loan she received from the institution was her capital to start up a business. She had been doing many different kinds of businesses until then just to have an income to sustain the needs of her children. Her eldest child is a college undergraduate and is presently unemployed. Her second child is a high school graduate and was not able to pursue his college degree. Instead he worked as a laborer and supports Susan financially now. Susan\u2019s third child is in high school and her youngest is graduating in elementary this year.\r\n<p>\r\nSusan\u2019s primary business now is buying and selling of herbal medicines and cosmetics. She sells them directly in different municipalities of the province. At times she also sells food in the neighborhood and even in offices within the municipality where she lives. To enhance further this business, Susan applied for a loan from ASHI. The amount she borrowed is the same as her previous loan, based on her capacity to pay and the needs of her business. Presently, Susan continues saving her profit for emergency needs of her business and children. She hopes that her children who are still in school will be able to graduate from college.\r\n<p>\r\nSusan has been a very good member of ASHI and a strong woman.

He keeps the larger bulls to lease out for plowing and, this way, generate the necessary income for his family.  Dedicating himself to livestock has been more beneficial than farming, given that earnings are generated more frequently and there is less risk of loss.  For the future, William plans to have a well-outfitted stable where he can house a greater number of animals.  This is his first loan through MFP.  He is very enthusiastic about working with his cooperative bank where, as a new member, he promises to be very active and work towards the common good of the members.

This is 36-year-old Salma M. from Mwanza. She is married, with five children between the ages of 5 and 11 years old.\n\nSalma has been running a caf\u00e9 business since 2008. Her business is called Caf\u00e9\/Mama Lishe. A local restaurant or caf\u00e9 in Tanzania usually consists of a rough wooden table and some long, wooden benches. The food is all local: rice, ugali (a hot sticky dough made from maize flour), plantain (a cooked savory banana), all served with beans, vegetables, meat, and a variety of sauces.\n\nSalma works at the business for twelve hours per day, six days per week and is assisted by two employees. She currently earns about 100 USD from her business. She is requesting a loan of 400 USD in order to purchase potatoes and wheat flour. In the future, she plans to expand her business. Salma thanks you for your support!\n\n\nAbout SELFINA: \nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.\n\nCustoms and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.\n\nOne of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

It is said that Pepsi is one of the most recognized symbols in the world, and it\u2019s true. Even in the most remote villages in Africa, there is usually some kind of shop selling Coke, Fanta, and Guinness. The hot weather makes soft drinks all the more appealing - a very cheap marketing tool! All of which explains why selling soft drinks is such a popular venture.\n\nFarida works at the business for twelve hours per day, six days per week and currently earns about 150 USD from her business. She is requesting a loan of 325 USD in order to purchase more soda to sell to her customers. In the future, she plans to expand her business. Farida thanks you for your support!\n\n\nAbout SELFINA: \nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.\n\nCustoms and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.\n\nOne of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":350596,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase

Her husband is a security guard but also helps part-time with the growing business operation through lending a hand in the business's logistics. They are partners not only in marriage, but also in business. Their family of three lives in a small urban area in the mountains of Montalban.\r\n\r\nNorily's business is a retail variety store, selling basic goods and commodities such as rice, charcoal, and other grocery items to a poor community. \"We are very happy to help the people. Sometimes they have no money for the day so we give them their needs anyway and ask them to pay it within the week,\" says Norily.\r\n\r\nThe business started in 1999 as a small store with a few packs of noodles and canned goods and now has expanded to even distributing government rice to the community. \"The store's best asset, I guess, is its rice distribution. So many families in our area need food on their tables, but some can't afford to buy commercial rice because it is expensive (P30 per kilo). And it is just a great privilege for us to offer help by being a government rice distribution center.\" The government's social welfare department chose Norily's store as a distribution center to the poor in their community.\r\n\r\nHaving been a great help to the urban poor community in their town, they now plan to also expand their market by catering to the middle class residents in their area. They are hoping to open a balloon and party-needs business. They need around P50,000 to start the business, and have applied for a medium business loan from Center for Community Transformation (CCT).\r\n\r\nTheir recent loan with CCT, their 11th loan, amounted to P45,000 which put their retail store in a firm financial position.

Neema thanks you for her support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial status and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":350602,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To purchase cloths in bulk.

from Tanzania!  This is 25-year-old Elieth T. from Mwanza. She is married and has one child who is seven years old. Elieth has made a living running a flower shop since 2006. She works at this business for six hours a day, seven days per week and is assisted by one employee. Elieth currently earns about $200 a month from her business, and is applying for a loan of $400 to buy more flowers to resell to her customers. In the future, she plans to expand her business. Elieth thanks you for her support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA!\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":350611,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Decorations Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy more flowers to resell to her customers.

She currently earns about 250 USD from her business. She is requesting a loan of 400 USD in order to purchase long hair, blue hair and red hair. In the future, she plans to expand her business. Christina thanks you for her support!\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About SELFINA: <\/b>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.\r\n\r\nCustoms and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.\r\n\r\nOne of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":350625,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","use":"To

Kharka has been running her restaurant for thirteen years and is excited to be making some adjustments to the business. \r\n\r\nKharka travelled to the office of BPW Patan (Kiva\u2019s field partner in Nepal) to apply for the loan and hopes to receive the loan at the next group meeting in her district of Kulashwor.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":350634,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"To

He has been a struggling father who has made every effort to educate his children and provide for their needs and necessities. He has lost so many lives in the family: his mother and dad, brothers, and a sister. This has forced him to take on additional burdens in taking care of their children and grandchildren. Faced with the these challenges, the need arose for him to join a financial institution from which he could borrow money and help make ends meet. Encouraged by his friends, and fueled by the need for more capital for his business, he joined GHAPE. Since then, he has benefited immensely from the organization.\r\n<p>\r\nIf he is approved for his fourth loan, J. plans to invest in the selling of beer and the rearing of pigs. More specifically, he will buy piglets, pigs, and pig feed. Experience has taught him how to manage a business like this.

Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement. GHAPE instils a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is from Cajamarca city, but she has lived in the city of Lima for 22 years.  She currently lives with her 19 year old son, Eurles, in her own house.\r\n\r\nShe has been selling beer for three years.  This business has given her a good income.  Thanks to her sales, she can pay the household expenses.  The first thing she does in her work is go to a distributor to fill her order.  The distributor takes the cases of beverages to Bremilda\u2019s house, which is where she sells them.  Bremilda likes being able to sell from her house, and she gets good earnings.  Sometimes she is very tired because arranging the cartons and selling them is heavy work that she does alone.\r\n\r\nThe most gratifying thing is that, thanks to her work, she considers herself to be a hard working, independent woman.  She knows that if she keeps putting effort into what she does, in the future she can expand her store.

Amancia says that she used to buy clothes at a discount from a warehouse in Santiago and then sell individual items of clothing in her neighborhood.   Now, she hopes to use Esperanza to help her to start selling clothes again.  Amancia believes that with the help of Esperanza she will be able to make her business a success.  She says that Esperanza\u2019s loan will allow her to obtain an additional discount from the warehouse because she will be able to buy in bulk.\n\nAmancia\u2019s hope is to spend the income from her clothing sales to provide her children with a good education.  She says that she wants to help her children to learn English and dreams that she will be able to send them all to college.

She says that once she returns from Santiago with clothes, she will be able to sell them out of her house for a profit. Although her business is just beginning, it seems promising because it follows the same business model as many other successful Esperanza clothing vendors.\r\n\r\nBelky hopes that by reinvesting the profits of her clothing sales she will be able to expand her business enough to send her children to college, own her own house, and buy some luxury items such as a cellphone. She says her ultimate goal is to one day own her own clothing store.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2100,"image":{"id":350786,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To

This is 38-year-old Sara N. from Mbeya. She is married with 4 children between the ages of 3 and 18.  Sara has been running a local restaurant and rice business since 1993. A mama lishe (local restaurant or caf\u00e9) in Tanzania usually consists of a rough wooden table and some long, wooden benches. The food is all-local; rice, ugali (a hot sticky dough, made from maize flour), plantains (a cooked savory banana), all served with beans, vegetables, meat, and a variety of sauces. She works at the business for 9-12  hours per day, 6 days per week and is assisted by 2 employees.  Sara currently earns about 50 USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan in order to purchase additional stock of rice.  In the future, she plans to increase the quantity and range of her business. Sara thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nAbout Sero Lease and Finance Limited (SELFINA):\r\nSELFINA is a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":350822,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase

De esta manera obtiene ingresos econ\u00f3micos en diversos puestos del mercado; por ello, desde muy temprano por la ma\u00f1ana, visita cada puesto para dejar su mercader\u00eda y posteriormente realiza las cobranzas. Adicionalmente; los fines de semana, vende sus prendas de forma ambulante en las diferentes ferias de su localidad, caminando desde las 9 de la ma\u00f1ana hasta las 6 de la tarde. Pero este sacrificio tiene su recompensa en las gratificantes ganancias que obtiene con sus ventas. El deseo a futuro de Kelly es tener un puesto de venta estable donde venda sus prendas con mayor tranquilidad y comodidad. Este es su 13avo cr\u00e9dito con Microfinanzas PRISMA y lo que m\u00e1s valor de su banco comunal es el trabajo en equipo que realiza con todas sus compa\u00f1eras. La compra de prendas durante estos meses es muy beneficiosa debido a la temporada de invierno, pues la demanda de ropa abrigada se incrementa y los 1500 soles que solicita le servir\u00e1n para la compra de esta mercader\u00eda.

Thanks to her work, she managed to buy a plot of land where she built her own house.  She has realized the activity of selling baby clothing for more than 8 years, having the opportunity to sell her merchandise from friends\u2019 stalls in the market.  For this, she pays them a percentage of her earnings and she generates income from various locations at the market.  She visits each post very early in the morning to deliver her products, and later collects her profits.  Additionally, she sells her wares on weekends at the different markets in her area walking from 9 am until 6 pm.  However, this sacrifice has its reward in the income she earns with her sales.  Kelly\u2019s wish for the future is to have a set site where she can sell her clothes more easily and comfortably.  This is the 13th credit with Microfinanzas PRISMA and what she most appreciates about her cooperative bank is the teamwork she has with the other members.  Buying clothes during these months is very beneficial given that it\u2019s winter, therefore the demand for warm clothing goes up and the 1,500 soles she requests will help her buy more merchandise.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":350829,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To increase her merchandise.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-07-13T11:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kelly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":162.83},{"due_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":163.78},{"due_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":175.24},{"due_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":183.12},{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":190.11},{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":199.92},{"due_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":208.26},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":216.74}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.59},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.41},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.04},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.37},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.64},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.42},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":54.28,"local_amount":162.83,"processed_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:46:18Z","rounded_local_amount":165.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211991,"comment":null},{"amount":54.59,"local_amount":163.78,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:29:29Z","rounded_local_amount":166.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641521,"comment":null},{"amount":58.41,"local_amount":175.24,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:43:15Z","rounded_local_amount":177.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080961,"comment":null},{"amount":61.04,"local_amount":183.12,"processed_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:16:59Z","rounded_local_amount":185.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997102,"comment":null},{"amount":63.37,"local_amount":190.11,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:31Z","rounded_local_amount":192.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842457,"comment":null},{"amount":208.31,"local_amount":624.92,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:07:14Z","rounded_local_amount":634.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734021,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by many other financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":350833,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase additional stocks of rice, sugar, salt, cooking oil and soda","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-07-11T02:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Winfrida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":900000,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":150000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-08-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:55:14Z","rounded_local_amount":152950,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73665068,"comment":null},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:49:05Z","rounded_local_amount":152950,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105780,"comment":null},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:30:30Z","rounded_local_amount":152950,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022890,"comment":null},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:44:07Z","rounded_local_amount":152950,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103868131,"comment":null},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:46:27Z","rounded_local_amount":152950,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757327,"comment":null},{"amount":116.65,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:39Z","rounded_local_amount":152950,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146421,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-07-12T00:42:35Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":121380,"name":"Virginia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"With only one pumpboat, 49-year-old Virginia O. and her husband were able to start their fishing business.

With her husband, they have a home of their own which was obtained with much sacrifice.  Supporting her partner with the household\u2019s expenses was a deciding factor in her current occupation, as she had worked in various arenas before deciding to dedicate herself to public transportation 6 years ago.  They managed to buy some vehicles that they rent to people who are in the transportation business.  Due to the delinquency that abounds in her zone, each time she leases out one of her vehicles she examines each potential renter very carefully.  Another activity she realizes is tending to the mechanical repairs and maintenance of her motocars at month-end to make sure they are operating at their best.  The daily income she generates is very beneficial to her family and, for this reason, Luz would like to acquire more vehicles to increase revenue.  This is her 13th loan with Microfinanzas PRISMA and, over this time, she has worked very responsibly like her other colleagues at the cooperative bank.  She will invest the 1,500 soles she is requesting into repairs for one of her motocars that needs some work in order to continue to run. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":350836,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","use":"To purchase replacement parts for her motocar.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-07-13T11:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":162.83},{"due_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":163.78},{"due_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":175.24},{"due_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":183.12},{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":190.11},{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":199.92},{"due_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":208.26},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":216.74}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.59},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.41},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.04},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.37},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.64},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.42},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":54.28,"local_amount":162.83,"processed_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:46:06Z","rounded_local_amount":165.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211992,"comment":null},{"amount":54.59,"local_amount":163.78,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:29:52Z","rounded_local_amount":166.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641522,"comment":null},{"amount":58.41,"local_amount":175.24,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:43:39Z","rounded_local_amount":177.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080962,"comment":null},{"amount":61.04,"local_amount":183.12,"processed_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:17:07Z","rounded_local_amount":185.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997103,"comment":null},{"amount":63.37,"local_amount":190.11,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:36Z","rounded_local_amount":192.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842458,"comment":null},{"amount":208.31,"local_amount":624.92,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:07:51Z","rounded_local_amount":634.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734022,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

She is a baker who uses flour for her production, and has done so for eighteen years now, in spite of the challenges she faces. She bakes bread and other pastries frequently requested by her customers. She brings them to customers herself, in the market center. People also come to her to buy. Her only problem now has to do with a lack of adequate funds to buy raw materials, which are needed in order to meet the demand of her customers. She requests a loan support to remain in business.

She always thought about having a business and, thanks to her partner, she managed to install a pharmacy that provides services for her district.  She has been attending to her customers very responsibly for more than 10 years, trying to provide the best medications to help restore health.  Regardless, she didn\u2019t always have all the necessary items in her inventory.  At the onset of her business, she only carried basic medicines and this limited her sales.  Over time, however, she took advantage of the demand and acquired display cases and windows and saw the need to rent a large enough space in her district.  This is where she works to this day.  Her business has been expanding, and Marlene hopes to open another drugstore soon.  She hopes that, through her and her husband\u2019s efforts, they will manage to reach their goals.  The responsibility and order that exists within the group is what she most appreciates about being part of a cooperative bank, and she has confidence in each and every one of her colleagues.

Due to her willingness to work, she learned how to make bread rolls, and through lots of practice and dedication, started to find new ways to produce various snacks.

Once customers sampled the taste of her sweet pastries, demand for her products increased and Ver\u00f3nica took advantage of this opportunity.  She is now well known in her community and her commitment to success continues.  She sells her products in the central market every weekend in order to maximize her profits.

(greetings) from Tanzania! This is 40-year-old Zamda S. from Mbeya. She is married with four children between the ages of 10 and 25. Additionally, she is responsible for supporting one dependent who is an orphan because her parents died of HIV. \r\n\r\nZamda has been running a \u201cgenge\u201d business since 2002. A genge (grocery store) is usually a very basic structure made of wood with a tin roof, where general items such as onions, tomatoes, chili, oil, rice and dried fish are sold. It is the kind of place local people send their children running to fetch something when they are in the middle of cooking the evening meal and don\u2019t have time to go all the way to the market to buy the missing ingredient.\r\n\r\nShe works at the business for nine to 12 hours per day, seven days per week. Zamda currently earns about $90 a month from her business. She is requesting a loan in order to purchase additional stock of rice, sugar, salt, cooking oil and soda. In the future, she plans to increase the quantity and range of her business and to open the same business at new location.\r\n\r\nZamda  thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback micro-finance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":350840,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase additional stock of rice, sugar, salt, cooking oil and soda","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-07-11T04:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zamda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":600000,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-08-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:55:32Z","rounded_local_amount":103787.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73665069,"comment":null},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:49:38Z","rounded_local_amount":103787.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105781,"comment":null},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:31:40Z","rounded_local_amount":103787.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022891,"comment":null},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:44:31Z","rounded_local_amount":103787.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103868132,"comment":null},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:46:47Z","rounded_local_amount":103787.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757328,"comment":null},{"amount":79.15,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:45Z","rounded_local_amount":103787.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146422,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-07-12T22:34:21Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":121401,"name":"Hazel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Her dream of having a big grocery store encouraged 28-year-old Hazel S. to apply as a sales lady.

M. es un se\u00f1or de 64 a\u00f1os de edad que vive con su madre su esposa y su hijo.\nLa comunidad en la cual vive don Elvin se llama El Sauce de Santa Teresita de Turrialba, Provincia de Cartago.  Es una peque\u00f1a comunidad rural de aproximadamente dos mil habitantes. Sus pobladores se dedican a la producci\u00f3n de leche y siembra de caf\u00e9. Tiene un relieve irregular y mucho del terreno se mantiene como bosque tropical h\u00famedo. La comunidad tiene paisajes muy pintorescos que combinan el bosque tropical con dos lindas lagunas, plantaciones de caf\u00e9 y lecher\u00edas. El Sauce se localiza aproximadamente a hora y media en bus de Turrialba, el centro de comercio m\u00e1s cercano. Sin embargo, varias veces al a\u00f1o el camino se vuelve intransitable por las lluvias que azotan la zona. Este es sin duda uno de los principales desaf\u00edos para la comunidad. \n\nCuando no exist\u00edan actividades muchas personas optaron por salir a buscar trabajos en Turrialba o en fincas bananeras ubicadas en la Zona Atl\u00e1ntica de Costa Rica. Actualmente los precios del caf\u00e9 y la leche han mejorado, por lo tanto los vecinos buscan c\u00f3mo invertir en proyectos en la misma zona y de esta forma evitar migrar.\n\nDon Elvin  se dedica desde hace 3 a\u00f1os a la producci\u00f3n de leche y queso como una forma de generar ingresos para su familia. Dice estar muy contento porque gracias a este proyecto ha podido salir adelante. Comenta que la producci\u00f3n de leche la vende a la planta de elaboraci\u00f3n de quesos, propiedad de la Asociaci\u00f3n de Productores de Leche de El Sauce.\n\nEl queso de la regi\u00f3n donde vive don Elvin es famoso en todo Costa Rica. Es un queso fresco que se le conoce tradicionalmente como \u201cqueso tipo Turrialba\u201d. A los \u201cticos\u201d (como se les conoce a los habitantes de Costa Rica) les gusta mucho consumir este producto; se le encontrar\u00e1 en las mesas acompa\u00f1ando cualquier tipo de comida.  Por esta raz\u00f3n, el mercado para dicho producto es realmente bueno.\n\nDon Elvin desea obtener un micro cr\u00e9dito por un monto de \u00a2500.000 (quinientos mil colones) para comprar una vaca lechera m\u00e1s y as\u00ed aumentar la producci\u00f3n de leche. El sabe que contar con una vaca m\u00e1s es un mayor sacrificio y demandar\u00e1 m\u00e1s trabajo. Sin embargo, el deseo de ser un microempresario exitoso y  sacar adelante a su familia mejorando las condiciones de vida, lo motiva a esforzarse con gran esmero y dedicaci\u00f3n.\n\nDon Elvin es cliente de la Asociaci\u00f3n de Productores de El Sauce, una organizaci\u00f3n local socia de la micro financiera EDESA. Este ser\u00e1 su d\u00e9cimo segundo pr\u00e9stamo y con \u00e9l espera continuar creciendo a nivel personal y econ\u00f3mico\n\n\n","en":"Elvin M. M., 64, lives with his mother, wife, and son.  Elvin lives in the El Sauce de Santa Teresita Turrialba community in the Cargao province.  It is a small rural community with approximately two thousand inhabitants.  The community members work at milk production and planting coffee.  The landscape is irregular, and much of the land is humid tropical rain forest.  The community has very colorful scenery that combines the tropical rainforest with two pretty lakes, coffee plantations, and dairies.  \r\n\r\nEl Sauce is located approximately an hour and a half by bus from Turrialba, which is the closest commercial center.  Nevertheless, several times a year the road becomes impossible to use because of the rains that batter the area.  This is, without doubt, one of the biggest challenges for the area.\r\n\r\nWhen there was no work, many people chose to leave to look for work in Turrialba or in banana farms located in the Atlantic zone of Costa Rica.  Currently, coffee and milk prices have improved.  Therefore, the members of the neighborhood are looking for ways to invest in projects in their own zone in order to avoid emigrating.\r\n\r\nFor three years Elvin has worked at milk and cheese production as a way to generate income for his family.  He is very happy; thanks to this work, he has been able to get ahead.  He sells his milk to the plant that makes cheese, which is the property of the Association of Milk Producers of El Sauce.\r\n\r\nThe cheese from the region where Elvin lives is famous throughout Costa Rica.  It is a fresh cheese that is traditionally known as \u201cqueso tipo Turrialba\u201d (Turrialba type of cheese).  The \u201cticos\u201d (inhabitants of Costa Rica) really like to eat this product, which can be found on their tables as an accompaniment to all types of food.  For that reason, the market for the product is really good.\r\n\r\nElvin wants a loan for $500 to buy another milking cow in order to increase his milk production.  He knows that having another cow is a big sacrifice, and that it will demand more work.  Nevertheless, the desire to be a successful entrepreneur, to help his family\u2019s future, and to improve their living conditions, motivates him to work with great dedication.\r\n\r\nElvin is a member of the Association of Producers of El Sauce, a local organization belonging to the micro finance association Edesa.  This will be his 12th loan, and he hopes to continue growing personally and economically.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

S. es un  joven  de 21 a\u00f1os de edad, soltero el cual vive  actualmente con sus padres y su abuela.\n\nLa comunidad en la cual vive Esteban se llama El Sauce de Santa Teresita de Turrialba, Provincia de Cartago.  Es una peque\u00f1a comunidad rural de aproximadamente dos mil habitantes. Sus pobladores se dedican a la producci\u00f3n de leche y siembra de caf\u00e9. Tiene un relieve irregular y mucho del terreno se mantiene como bosque tropical h\u00famedo. La comunidad tiene paisajes muy pintorescos que combinan el bosque tropical con dos lindas lagunas, plantaciones de caf\u00e9 y lecher\u00edas. El Sauce se localiza aproximadamente a hora y media en bus de Turrialba, el centro de comercio m\u00e1s cercano. Sin embargo, varias veces al a\u00f1o el camino se vuelve intransitable por las lluvias que azotan la zona. Este es sin duda uno de los principales desaf\u00edos para la comunidad. \n\nCuando no exist\u00edan actividades muchas personas optaron por salir a buscar trabajos en Turrialba o en fincas bananeras ubicadas en la Zona Atl\u00e1ntica de Costa Rica. Actualmente los precios del caf\u00e9 y la leche han mejorado, por lo tanto los vecinos buscan c\u00f3mo invertir en proyectos en la misma zona y de esta forma evitar migrar.\n\nComo parte de las respuestas a esa situaci\u00f3n, desde hace dos a\u00f1os se instal\u00f3 en la comunidad una planta de elaboraci\u00f3n de quesos, propiedad de la Asociaci\u00f3n de Productores de Leche de El Sauce, hecho que motiv\u00f3 a Esteban a iniciar en la producci\u00f3n de leche para luego venderla a esta planta. \nAsegura que su familia  se ha dedicado a esta actividad durante mucho tiempo, por lo que ha podido experimentar todos los cuidados que demanda, adem\u00e1s de la instrucci\u00f3n recibida por parte de sus familiares  a lo largo del tiempo. \n\nEl queso de la regi\u00f3n donde vive Esteban es famoso en todo Costa Rica. Es un queso fresco que se le conoce tradicionalmente como \u201cqueso tipo Turrialba\u201d. A los \u201cticos\u201d (como se les conoce a los habitantes de Costa Rica) les gusta mucho consumir este producto; se le encontrar\u00e1 en las mesas acompa\u00f1ando cualquier tipo de comida.  Por esta raz\u00f3n, el mercado para dicho producto es realmente bueno.\n\nEsteban desea obtener un micro cr\u00e9dito de \u00a2500,000 (quinientos mil colones) para comprar una vaca lechera y poder iniciar con su negocio ya que desea ser un microempresario exitoso y  as\u00ed poder ayudar a que su familia siga adelante esto es una de las cosas que lo motiva a esforzarse y trabajar con mucho esmero. \n\nEsteban es socio de la Asociaci\u00f3n de Productores de El Sauce, una de las 100 organizaciones socias de EDESA en Costa Rica. Este ser\u00e1 su primer pr\u00e9stamo y con \u00e9l espera continuar creciendo a nivel personal y econ\u00f3mico. Tambi\u00e9n destaca que gracias a este tipo de organizaciones y medios facilitadores de cr\u00e9dito puede dedicar m\u00e1s tiempo a las actividades productivas. \n\n\n\n","en":"Esteban M. S. is a 21 year old single man who currently lives with his parents and his grandmother.  Esteban lives in the El Sauce de Santa Teresita Turrialba community in the Cargao province.  It is a small rural community with approximately two thousand inhabitants.  The community members work at milk production and planting coffee.  The landscape is irregular, and much of the land is humid tropical rain forest.  The community has very colorful scenery that combines the tropical rainforest with two pretty lakes, coffee plantations, and dairies.  El Sauce is located approximately an hour and a half by bus from Turrialba, which is the closest commercial center.  Nevertheless, several times a year the road becomes impossible to use because of the rains that batter the area.  This is, without doubt, one of the biggest challenges for the area.\r\n\r\nWhen there was no work, many people chose to leave to look for work in Turrialba or in banana farms located in the Atl\u00e1ntic zone of Costa Rica.  Currently, the coffee and milk prices have improved.  Therefore, the members of the neighborhood are looking for ways to invest in projects in their own zone in order to avoid emigrating.\r\n\r\nAs part of the solution to this situation, two years ago a cheese making plant was set up in the community.  It is the property of the Association of Milk Producers of El Sauce.  This motivated Esteban to set up milk production to later sell to the plant.  His family has been in this business for a long time.  That is why he has been able to pay attention to all of the necessary details.  Over time he has received instructions from his family.\r\n\r\nThe cheese from the region where Elvin lives is famous throughout Costa Rica.  It is a fresh cheese that is traditionally known as \u201cqueso tipo Turrialba\u201d (Turrialba type of cheese).  The \u201cticos\u201d (inhabitants of Costa Rica) really like to eat this product, which you will find on their tables as an accompaniment to all types of food.  For that reason, the market for the product is really good.\r\n\r\nEsteban wants a loan for $500 to buy a milking cow in order to set up his business.  He wants to be a successful entrepreneur and be able to help his family get ahead.  That is one of the things that motivate him to put forth effort and work very hard.\r\n\r\nEsteban is a member of the Association of Producers of El Sauce, one of the one hundred  organizations belonging to the micro finance association Edesa.  This will be his first loan, and he hopes to continue growing on a personal and economic level.  Thanks to this type of organization and their means for facilitating loans, he can spend more time on productive activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

He has also been able to help the community, a community that is regularly struck with bad weather and unemployment.  \r\n\r\nMr. Antonio would like a loan of 685,000 colones to buy several young bulls so he can increase production.  He knows that having more cows will be a greater sacrifice and make more work for him.

At around 11am she leaves for the main streets of her city, offering her delicious popsicles to the passengers of different public transportation and to the rest of people that are traveling.

She is a very hard-working woman and lives with her husband and three children. As for her work, she sells cosmetics. As for her everyday life, she seeks to provide her family with its daily bread. Dina makes visits with catalogs to offer her neighbors and family members various cosmetic products. They are very good customers and during her work hours she distributes their orders and collects payments. But what she would like most is to obtain a loan to use with other commercial distributors in order to offer a variety of products. The funds that she is requesting are for working capital in order to acquire various products such as perfumes, lotions and nail polish. Her hope is to expand her business and extend it to other parts of her city. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Sarah Shimmin, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":350988,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-07-14T03:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dina Rebeca ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":10000,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":833.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T15:26:07Z","rounded_local_amount":848.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73600012,"comment":null},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T17:50:01Z","rounded_local_amount":848.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87035901,"comment":null},{"amount":43.78,"local_amount":875.53,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T21:41:47Z","rounded_local_amount":891.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96948295,"comment":null},{"amount":84.09,"local_amount":1681.86,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:33:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1712.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103790223,"comment":null},{"amount":41.23,"local_amount":824.67,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:35:06Z","rounded_local_amount":839.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118075422,"comment":null},{"amount":39.25,"local_amount":784.59,"processed_date":"2010-02-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:08:21Z","rounded_local_amount":798.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123911469,"comment":null},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2010-03-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-06T07:50:18Z","rounded_local_amount":848.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128947317,"comment":null},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2010-04-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:19:00Z","rounded_local_amount":848.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136675605,"comment":null},{"amount":44.61,"local_amount":892.13,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:17:48Z","rounded_local_amount":908.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144710002,"comment":null},{"amount":80.36,"local_amount":1607.9,"processed_date":"2010-06-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-16T07:39:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1636.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152045443,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-07-28T12:31:20Z","paid_date":"2010-07-16T07:39:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":121465,"name":"Jose Tomas","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jos\u00e9 Tomas M.

He lives with his wife and four children in a rural community in Costa Rica called Mollejones de Platanares, P\u00e9rez Zeled\u00f3n. Mollejones is a town located 150 kilometers south of San Jos\u00e9 Province, the capital of Costa Rica. It is 850 meters above sea level. Vegetables and coffee are farmed there and people also engage in other economic activities such as fattening cattle and hogs. There are also some organic agriculture projects, such as hydroponic vegetables. In addition to agriculture, the community has mechanic shops, a supermarket, small restaurants, and a furniture workshop. \r\n\r\nGuillermo has been working as a carpenter for a little more than two years. He makes furniture in a variety of styles and for different uses. He says that since he started this business, things have gone well for him. The business has been well accepted in his community and the income it has generated has helped him to support his family.\r\n\r\nAt this time Guillermo is requesting a loan of 685,000 CRC to buy more wood and other materials that he needs to make the furniture. With this, he hopes that his small business will grow and that it will generate enough income for him to improve his living conditions. \r\n\r\nGuillermo is part of the Empresa de Cr\u00e9dito Comunal de Bancruce, one of the 100 partner organizations of EDESA in Costa Rica. As a member, he has received a small loan that has allowed him to grow like other small business owners.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jennifer Day, Kiva

N. is from the village of Gango, Ozamis City, Misamis Occidental. She is 41 years old, and married with three school-aged children. To make a living, Josephine owns and operates a business venture in the food sector, making and selling food. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from preparing and selling cooked food for daily meals. Josephine has been engaged in her business for over a year and earns approximately 1000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Josephine joined Kiva partner, GDMPC, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She is requesting a loan of 5000 PHP, which will be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to prepare food for sale. This loan will be her first from GDMPC. Josephine plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's general living conditions. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":350600,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She is 48 years old, and is married with seven adult-aged children. To make a living, Ma. Carmen owns and operates a business venture in the services sector. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from providing manicure and pedicure services in the local community. Ma. Carmen has been engaged in her business for over a year and earns approximately 1500 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2007, Ma. Carmen joined Kiva partner, GDMPC, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Ma. Carmen has successfully repaid a previous loan from GDMPC. She is now requesting a new loan of 6000 PHP, which will be used to purchase materials needed to provide her services. This loan will be her fifth from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve and expand her business. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About GDMPC<\/b><br>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Teosan has successfully repaid a previous loan from GDMPC. She is now requesting a new loan of 3000 PHP, which she will use to invest in expanding her business.

R. is from the village of Kinuman Sur, Ozamis City, Misamis Occidental. She is 54 years old, and is widowed with one adult-aged child. To make a living, Leonora owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector running a sari-sari or general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling both food and daily use products in the local community. Leonora has been engaged in her business for over a year and earns approximately 1000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2009, Leonora joined Kiva partner, GDMPC, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Leonora is requesting a loan of 5000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be her first from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's general living conditions. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About GDMPC<\/b><br>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

D. is from the village of Kinuman Sur, Ozamiz City, Misamis Occidental. She is 30 years old, and married with one young child. To make a living, Merlinda owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector running a sari-sari or general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling both food and daily use products in the local community. Merlinda has been engaged in her business for over a year and earns approximately 1000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2009, Merlinda joined Kiva partner, GDMPC, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Merlinda is requesting a loan of 5000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be her first from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's general living conditions. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About GDMPC<\/b><br>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

T. is from the village of Curvada, Tukuran, Zamboanga del Sur. She is 40 years old, and is married with four school-aged children. To make a living, Helen owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector operating a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling rice in the local community. Helen has been engaged in her business for over ten years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2008, Helen joined Kiva partner, GDMPC, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Helen has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from GDMPC. This loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Helen is now requesting a new loan of 6000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding her business. This loan will be her second from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's general living conditions and pay for her children's tuition. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About GDMPC<\/b><br>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

L. is from the village of Anonang, Aurora, Zamboanga del Sur. She is 48 years old. Aquilinia is married and has 5 adult-aged children. To make a living, Aquilinia owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector selling crabs in the local community. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling crabs to tourists and local community members. Aquilinia has been engaged in her business for over 20 years and earns approximately 3,000 Philippine Pesos (about $62 US) a month for these activities.\r\n<P>\r\nIn 2009, Aquilinia joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Aquilinia is requesting a new loan of 5,000 pesos which will be used to purchase additional crabs to sell. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Aquilinia from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n<P>\r\nAbout GDMPC\r\n<P>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n<P>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

G. is from the village of Kinuman Sur, Ozamiz City, Misamis Occidental. She is 34 years old. Joerinda is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Joerinda owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector running a sari-sari or general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling daily use products such as soap, shampoo, toothpaste etc., in the local community. Joerinda has been engaged in her business for over 1 year and earns approximately 1500 PHP a month for these activities.<P>\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Joerinda joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Joerinda is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Joerinda from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. <P>\r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n<P>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.<P>\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

This is 34-year-old Christina M. from Mbeya. She is single. Christina has been running a used clothes store since 2002. Second-hand clothes journey across the oceans from America and Europe, and are then washed, ironed and sold in bulk by wholesalers in Tanzania to retailers who then re-wash and re-iron them for sale on the streets and in the surrounding towns and villages. These clothes are becoming increasingly popular, especially amongst the younger generation, because of their low cost, and the general appeal of anything modern. \r\n\r\nShe works at the business for 9-12 hours per day, six days per week. Christina currently earns about US$90 a month from her business. She is requesting a loan in order to purchase additional stocks of clothes for her business. In the future, she plans to increase the quantity and range of her business. Christina thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through microleasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":351126,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"To

(Greetings!) from Tanzania! This is 24-year-old Mercy K. from Mbeya. She is married with a 5-year-old child. Additionally, she is responsible for supporting two dependents because they are orphans. \r\n\r\nMercy has been running a tailoring business since 2002. She purchases vitambaa (material), vitenge (a traditional Tanzanian cloth with wax print), and kanga (printed cotton fabric often with a border along all four sides) and makes them into clothing mainly for women.\r\n\r\nShe works at the business for 9-12 hours per day, six days per week, and is assisted by one employee. Mercy currently earns about US$80 a month from her business. She is requesting a loan in order to purchase tailoring material for her business. In the future, she plans to improve the quality and range of her product. Mercy thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through microleasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.

(greetings) from Tanzania!  This is 37-year-old Sophia C. from Mbeya.  She is married and has two children.  One child is 11 years old, and the other child is 17 years old.  In addition, she is responsible for supporting 20 dependants (they are orphans). <p>\r\n\r\nEver since 1992, Sophia has been operating an agriculture (crop) business.  In particular, she purchases and sells crops for a profit.  She works at her business 9-12 hours per day and 6 days per week.  At present, Sophia currently earns approximately $110 per month from her business operations.  She is now requesting a loan in the amount of $775 to purchase crops in bulk for her business.  In the future, she plans to expand her business to a new location.  Sophia thanks you for your support! <p>\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has been a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing, which helps to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women in Tanzania.  You see, customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets.  Because they lack tangible assets that can serve as collateral, women in Tanzania are not considered credit-worthy by financial institutions.  As a result, low income women in Tanzania typically receive poor financial support; further, such women only have limited access to basic needs and services.  SELFINA engages in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania when it buys and leases equipment to women through an arrangement called a sale and leaseback transaction.  More specifically, when a client needs working capital, SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extends a loan to her to facilitate the transaction, and then leases the equipment back to her.  One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":351156,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"To expand and improve her business by purchasing additional crops in bulk ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-07-11T18:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":775,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sophia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":1000000,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":166666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.17},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.17},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":129.17},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":129.17},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":129.17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":129.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":129.17,"local_amount":166666.67,"processed_date":"2009-08-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:56:05Z","rounded_local_amount":170370.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73665092,"comment":null},{"amount":129.17,"local_amount":166666.67,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:51:15Z","rounded_local_amount":170370.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105804,"comment":null},{"amount":129.17,"local_amount":166666.67,"processed_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:32:56Z","rounded_local_amount":170370.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022914,"comment":null},{"amount":129.17,"local_amount":166666.67,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:45:05Z","rounded_local_amount":170370.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103868155,"comment":null},{"amount":129.17,"local_amount":166666.67,"processed_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:45:25Z","rounded_local_amount":170370.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757351,"comment":null},{"amount":129.15,"local_amount":166666.65,"processed_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:57Z","rounded_local_amount":170370.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146445,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-07-11T21:47:47Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":121506,"name":"Ganga Devi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ganga Devi M. is engaged in the business of weaving wool sweaters, caps, gloves, socks, bags, and other such wool items.

She is a 27-year-old mother of three children and lives with her partner. With the confidence and optimism that has always characterized her, she started her own business selling snacks on the the third floor of the municipal building in Tarapoto, where she has a well-conditioned place to serve her customers. She has made a living in this type of business for a number of years and is very satisfied with what she has achieved since it has gone very well. Currently, despite the passage of time, she continues working with the same business and relies on a faithful customer base. Her main clients are people who work in the building where she daily takes up her post and whom she tends to with the charisma she's known for. With the loan of 2,000, she plans to purchase snacks such as, different kinds of packaged cookies, chifles (fried banana slices covered in caramel), and various chocolates, to increase her supplies and better serve her customers. Gladys feels very prepared for everything and still has a strong desire to continue working and making headway. She is grateful for Kiva partner Manuela Ramos for contributing to the fulfillment of her dreams and goals.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":351502,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"Purchasing snacks","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"San Mart\u00edn","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2009-07-14T04:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gladys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2009-07-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:14:38Z","rounded_local_amount":343.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63206165,"comment":null},{"amount":112.61,"local_amount":333.67,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T18:50:07Z","rounded_local_amount":344.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73635420,"comment":null},{"amount":112.39,"local_amount":332.99,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T22:49:21Z","rounded_local_amount":343.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87074496,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T02:06:03Z","rounded_local_amount":343.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96989835,"comment":null},{"amount":112.62,"local_amount":333.68,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:42:43Z","rounded_local_amount":344.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103834779,"comment":null},{"amount":112.38,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-12-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:07:34Z","rounded_local_amount":343.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110726713,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-07-26T05:32:35Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:07:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":121528,"name":"Remegia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Remegia A. is a mother of strong faith and determined to get her four children out of the spiral of poverty.

She has been in this business for 15 years and acknowledges the proceeds the business had brought to them. This loan will be used to pay for the construction of two fish cages including materials, bamboo, fingerlings, fishnets and payment for human labor costs. Some money will be used for bamboo crafts as a secondary business.\r\n<p>\r\nRemegia is hopeful that with this loan she will be able to expand and have additional fish cages that will give her more fish to be sold in the market during harvest seasons.

She believes that everyone has an equal right to live a normal life far from poverty. She is a mother to four and all of the children are already of legal age. She is married to Efren, a 58-year-old fisherman. She lives in the island village of Kinabaogan, Binangonan, Rizal province.\r\nIn 2004, she joined ASHI (Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and KIVA partner in the Philippines with the hope of having access to capital to strengthen her business. Among her secondary businesses are fishing, general store and resale of peanuts. But just recently, she focused on the resale of ready-to-wear products as her primary business. Now on her seventh loan, she proposes a loan of 20,000 pesos as additional capital for the resale business. The loan will be used to pay for 36 pieces of slacks, t-shirts, pants, and many other ready-to-wear products.\r\nShe is hopeful that her business will grow and will catch the public demand. With the profits that she can earn from her business, she plans to help her grandchildren with their school fees and be able to save for their future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":351513,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To

She is a 39-year-old single mother with 3 dependent children. Milagro previously owned a general store, but littly by little she saved up her money until setting up her own dressmaking workshop in her house with the help of Manuela Ramos and her sewing skills. She states that her business is prosperous. Her customers pre-order her garments. One of her goals is setting up her own dressmaking factory with more sewing machines and overlock machines to display to her customers the dresses that she makes herself. She currently has this same business and has a fixed clientele that visits her house daily to solicit her services. She personally attends to them with the kindness for which she is noted. With this 2,300.00 PEN loan, she will purchase different cuts and designs of fabric, tools that she uses, like scissors, needles, sewing machine needles, pins, buttons, and an assortment of appliqu\u00e9s. Milagro now feels like a fulfilled woman with the desire to reach the rest of her dreams. She is grateful to the Manuela Ramos Movement for helping her start her own business, as well as for helping so many women who want to grow as entrepreneurs.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Elizabeth Casian, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":351516,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","use":"Purchase fabric and other sewing supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"San Mart\u00edn","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2009-07-14T07:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":775,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Milagro De Jesus ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2300,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":383.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":383.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":383.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":383.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":383.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":383.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.17},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.17},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.17},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":129.17},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":129.17},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":129.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":129.17,"local_amount":383.33,"processed_date":"2009-07-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:14:42Z","rounded_local_amount":394.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63206172,"comment":null},{"amount":129.28,"local_amount":383.67,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T18:50:55Z","rounded_local_amount":394.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73635427,"comment":null},{"amount":129.06,"local_amount":382.99,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T22:49:45Z","rounded_local_amount":394.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87074503,"comment":null},{"amount":129.17,"local_amount":383.33,"processed_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T02:06:13Z","rounded_local_amount":394.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96989842,"comment":null},{"amount":129.28,"local_amount":383.68,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:42:58Z","rounded_local_amount":394.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103834786,"comment":null},{"amount":129.04,"local_amount":383,"processed_date":"2009-12-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:07:36Z","rounded_local_amount":394.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110726720,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-07-15T05:13:28Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:07:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":121538,"name":"Gloria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gloria A. hails from the island village of Buhangin, Binangonan, Rizal province in the Philippines.

She is a 56-year-old married mother with one son who is now independent and has his own family. Yadira is a woman who likes to work, so she decided to set up her own carbonated drink and beverage business in a kiosk on the third floor of the Provincial Municipality of the City of Tarapoto. She manages the business herself, without having a fixed work schedule or a boss. She states that she started out with 300.00 PEN and bought three crates of soft drinks. She saw that business was good and that she needed more drinks, so little by little she invested in more. She currently has the same business and is well-known by her customers, the same workers and people who go to the municipality to fill out paperwork. With this 2,000.00 PEN, she will purchase more drinks, such as different flavors, brands, and sizes of soft drinks, as well as carbonated\/non-carbonated mineral water. Yadira has many goals ahead of her, and she feels motivated to do what she sets out to do. She is very grateful with the Manuela Ramos Movement for helping her when she most needed it. She is responsible with her payments and plans to stay that way.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Elizabeth Casian, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":351527,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase more drinks like different-flavored soda ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"San Mart\u00edn","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2009-07-14T05:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yadira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2009-07-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:14:40Z","rounded_local_amount":343.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63206177,"comment":null},{"amount":112.61,"local_amount":333.67,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T18:50:47Z","rounded_local_amount":344.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73635432,"comment":null},{"amount":112.39,"local_amount":332.99,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T22:49:41Z","rounded_local_amount":343.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87074508,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T02:06:12Z","rounded_local_amount":343.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96989847,"comment":null},{"amount":112.62,"local_amount":333.68,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:42:56Z","rounded_local_amount":344.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103834791,"comment":null},{"amount":112.38,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-12-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:07:35Z","rounded_local_amount":343.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110726724,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-07-28T00:08:10Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:07:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":121544,"name":"Yrma","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Yrma, pertenece al Banco Comunal \u201cEsmeralda\u201d, Distrito D.

She is married, 41 years old, and has 2 children that still depend on her. Hoping to see her children become professional and hoping to have her own income to achieve this goal, she decided to start her own business. She tells us that in her life she has faced many difficulties, but her fighting spirit for which she is known for and her drive to get ahead in life alone have encouraged her to start her own business in the sale of food. Currently she continues in this same business and things are going very well; she has loyal clients and is well known by her clients for having well-seasoned food. With this loan of 800 PEN she will purchase supplies to prepare her food, such as: sacks of rice and sugar, chickens and eggs, bunches of plantains, noodles, oil by the dozen, and kitchen utensils to provide quality service. She feels strong as she moves forward with her food sales, and subsequently hopes to open a well-equipped restaurant to provide her clients the best service and attention.

C. hails from the busy town of Morong, Rizal province, in the Philippines. She is 60 years old and a mother of three. All of her children are of legal age and have their own families. Her husband, Cipriano, is 60 years old and a traffic officer in their town.\r\n\r\nAs a woman of distinct faith and courage to overcome poverty, she really doesn\u2019t stop searching for a greener pastures. In 2003, she decided to join ASHI (Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and Kiva partner in the Philippines, with the hope that she would be able to access financial assistance for her business. She invested previous loans in the business of grilling pork, chicken, hot dogs and many other items. The business is in demand, especially during the afternoon when kids really long for grilled hot dogs, and for men who love eating grilled pork and chicken, especially while drinking beer. The business seems to be productive and profits sound. Now on her sixth loan, she seeks the amount of 25,000 pesos as additional capital for her primary business of grilling. Part of the loan will be used to pay for the sidecar of her tricycle as a secondary business.\r\n\r\nShe is optimistic that with the help of ASHI and Kiva, she can save money to build her own house and stop renting. Also, she is looking forward to having her own space for her grilling business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":351852,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

They will use the loan they obtained for different purposes. \r\n\r\nMrs. Koeurn S. is the village bank president. She is a farmer who owns a small piece of land to cultivate vegetables, specifically cucumbers, for her income. In the field, she now faces a small problem because infertile soil has affected her crop. She decided to ask for a loan to buy fertilizers to support the field. She hopes she can produce productive cucumbers for sale. Her husband, Mr. Eang Auk, helps her with the vegetable planting. Mrs. Koeurn S. has two children, one of whom is a laborer while the other is attending the local school. \r\n\r\nEight members in this village bank loan are end-of-term borrowers and the rest have monthly-payment loans. The end-of-term borrowers are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK\u2019s main product because they are the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. EoT loans allow them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time. AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09% and AMK has a default rate of 0% on Kiva.

I. is from the village of Paypayan, Oroquieta City, Misamis Occidental. He is 52 years old. Pablito is married and has five adult children. To make a living, Pablito owns and operates a charcoal-selling business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from making and selling charcoal to the local community members. Pablito has been engaged in his business for more than two years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Pablito joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Pablito is requesting a new loan of 4,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional  materials. This will be the first loan taken out by Pablito from GDMPC. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisher folks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

P. is a 50-year-old woman who has three children with her husband, Quirino P.. Her eldest child is in her second year of college taking Hotel and Restaurant Management; the second to eldest is a third-year high school student; and the youngest is in his sixth grade in elementary. Every year, the education of Hermenia's children incurs bigger financial expenses. Hermenia's business had been very helpful in supporting those expenses and has abled her children to continue their studies.\r\n\r\nIt has been thirty years that Hermenia is into her business buying and selling fish. Her membership in ASHI and the support of her loving husband and children enabled her to start up the business and have it grow. Despite financial struggles, Hermenia proved her trustworthiness and well-defined values by showing good performance in terms of her repayments, attendance and business.\r\n\r\nRecently, Hermenia, her husband and her children decided to apply for a loan in ASHI to enhance her business further and it could profit greatly. The whole family agreed on the idea of buying more variety of fish and to increase the volume of their purchases in order to sell more, cover a wider area of the municipality, and have bigger profits. Aside from intending Hermania's loan for her primary business, they also plan to enhance their hog-fattening business (backyard pig-raising to be sold after four months) for an alternative income during the off-season of fish.\r\n\r\nThrough the profit Hermenia's hog fattening business would generate, she aspires to purchase a motor fishing boat to be managed by her husband while her profit from buying and selling fish will be intended for her weekly repayments to ASHI, family daily needs, and her children's education.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":351875,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","use":"To buy

Engaged in her business for over five years, she earns approximately 3000 PHP a month. <p>\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Esterlita joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She is now requesting a loan of 5000 PHP to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Esterlita from GDMPC, and she plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

Her shop started as a hair salon. Rebecca employs two other people to wash, relax, and style hair. They also do manicures and pedicures. Many of her customers are her neighbors, but some people come from far away because they know of her work. One of the challenges of her business is that if customers don\u2019t have any income, they stop coming to her salon. Therefore, she decided to diversify her offerings and she began to sell other basic grocery items like sugar and onge out of the same shop.\r\n\r\nRebecca is a 30 years old, married, and the mother of three. Her children range from 3-10 years old. Her husband works casually and does not have a permanent job. Besides running this salon, Rebecca is a Community Healthcare Worker; a volunteer in her community. For two days each week she visits sick people in their homes, and counsels them and their caretakers.\r\n\r\nRebecca will use this loan to stock her shop; she will buy more of the products that she is running out of. Rebecca hopes that someday she will be able to grow her business into a large salon with many employees and workstations. Her biggest dream is to open a hairdressing school.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About K-MET:<\/b>\r\nK-MET, the NGO giving the loan, is unique in that it is not a traditional microfinance institution.

She went to a training school before starting her own business out of her home. When asked about her challenges, she explains that the road outside of her house is bad; that means that it is difficult for customers to get to her. She also explains that many customers don\u2019t want to pay for high quality work. Sometimes they place an order and when she provides the service, they only pay part of the balance, and then \u201cthey disappear\u201d \u2013 leaving her to cover the rest of her costs.\r\n<p>\r\nWinnie wants her business to grow so that her kids can have a better education. If possible, she wants to buy some land so that some day they can have an actual home.\r\n<p>\r\nK-MET, the NGO providing the loan, is not a traditional microfinance institution.

B. is from the village of Panduma, Tukuran, Zamboanga del Sur. She is 56 years old. Omo is widowed and has 3 adult-aged children. To make a living, Omo owns & operates a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling \"malong\" or tube skirts in the local community. Omo has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 3000 Philippine pesos (about $62 US) a month for these activities.\r\n<P>\r\nIn 2008, Omo joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Omo has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 pesos from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Omo is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offerings. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Omo from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n<P>\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n<P>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n<P>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

An  early childhood development schoolteacher, Eunice will use this loan to improve the school by purchasing chairs, tables, charts, and porridge for feedings. Many of the children she works with are vulnerable orphans; five of the 30 children she works with are HIV positive.  It is important for her to buy porridge because, she explains, that is sometimes the only meal that these kids get during the day. Not all of the children have someone to pay their school fees, but she takes them at her school anyway.<p>\r\n\t\r\nIn the evenings Eunice sells second-hand clothing to make ends meet for her family. She will use part of the loan to buy more clothing.<p>\r\n\r\nEunice explained that she is \u201cliving positively:\u201d she is living with HIV and she is living in a positive way. She said it is ok for people to know that about her, and she also wants people to know that people living with HIV\/AIDS require good nutrition. If they are taking their ARV medicine properly, they need to be eating well, which is a challenge for many people in Kisumu.<p>\r\n\r\nK-MET, the NGO providing Eunice\u2019s loan, is unique in that it is not a traditional microfinance institution.

a 30-year-old married mother of two children, ages 10 and 3, is a self-proclaimed \u201cfish monger\u201d who sells fried fish.   She buys the fish daily from the market and transports them by matatu (mini-bus taxi) to Nyamasaria, a more rural area not far out of town.<p>\r\n\r\nRose will use this money to buy more fish, mostly Tillapia from nearby Lake Victoria.  She finds that sometimes when she goes to buy fish there are none, so she will use some of the loan money to travel to the shore of the lake where she can buy the fish more directly.  Rose hopes to earn enough money from her business to educate her children and to get her \u201cdaily bread.\"  Her husband\u2019s income also helps support the family; her husband is a mechanic.<p>\r\n\r\nK-MET, the NGO giving providing this  loan, is unique in that it is not a traditional microfinance institution.

Fredrick does small-scale charcoal dealing. A large truck comes by his house regularly, from which he buys the charcoal in bulk. He then re-sells it to his neighbors when they come by his house.\r\n\r\nFredrick will use this loan to buy more charcoal. Sometimes he does not have enough when customers come to buy it. The loan will ensure that he has a complete supply. Fredrick hopes someday to have a big business so that he can pay his children's school fees. His children are not in school now because he does not have the funds.\r\n\r\nSomeday, Fredrick hopes to buy a motorbike, and to have a motorbike business to supplement his family\u2019s income that way, as well.\r\n\r\nK-MET, the NGO providing Fredrick\u2019s loan, is unique in that it is not a traditional micro-finance institution.
