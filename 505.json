Due to her kind behavior and good business sense, she attracts a good number of clients every month and improves her sales. She has applied for a loan from Kiva's partner, Asasah, for her boutique business. She will use the loan to purchase unstitched clothes and embroidery materials such as beads, colored thread and sketches to make more dresses of good designs to sell. She is confident that this investment will bring positive changes to her business and her income will further increase. She is a new loan applicant of Asasah and hopes that it will be a profitable experience for her. \r\n\r\nIn the photo, the lady with a book (an Asasah passbook) is

Amanda has a small store set up in part of her home, where she works every day of the week selling soap, detergents, daily consumer products and sweets.  In addition, she is very well-known by her neighbors for selling pupusas from Fridays through Sundays.  These are typical Salvadoran snacks maD. of a base of corn or rice that are filled with cheese, beans, squash and pork, which she makes according to the tastes of her customers.  In addition, she makes other traditional snacks in the afternoons almost every day, such as: pastries filled with meat, enchiladas and atoles (a hot drink maD. with corn meal.)  Amanda works very hard each day to proviD. for her family: she manages her family life and the household chores and at the same time takes care of both businesses.  Her daughter, who is in sixth graD., is her main source of inspiration. It has been more than 6 years since Amanda Guadalupe  started up these businesses, and now she has been able to increase her sales so that her dedication, patience and positive energy are paying off.  She has great dreams, and for this reason she requests a loan from Apoyo Integral, with which she aims to have other products in her store and a greater quantity of supplies to make her delicious pupusas and traditional snacks.  Her goal is to obtain better earnings so that she can ensure the welfare of all of her family

She studies in 6th class. \r\n<br>Irshad's husband is M. A. and he runs a video games shop. He offers his customers different and interesting games to play. His customer base is mostly young children who spend their leisure time playing games. His business is doing well and he makes good earnings. Irshad has applied for a loan from Kiva partner, Asasah, to assist her husband financially. With the loan, he will buy more video games in order to offer a better variety of games to his customers and make more money. He has been in this business for the past nine years and Irshad is hopeful that the investment will bring a return of good outcomes for the business. \r\n<br>Irshad is a regular loan user of Asasah and this is her fifth loan application. In previous loan years, she has maintained good credit behavior and attended every meeting. \r\n<br>Note: In the photo, the lady with the book (an Asasah Passbook) is Irshad.\r\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":653272,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Games","sector":"Entertainment","use":"To buy video games for video games shop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PK","country":"Pakistan","town":"Okara","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"30 70","type":"point"}},"partner_id":60,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Irshad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fozia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nasreen Akhtar","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Shamshad Akhtar","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PKR","disbursal_amount":75000,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":6868},{"due_date":"2011-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":6868},{"due_date":"2011-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":6868},{"due_date":"2011-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":6868},{"due_date":"2011-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":6868},{"due_date":"2011-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":6868},{"due_date":"2011-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":6868},{"due_date":"2011-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":6868},{"due_date":"2011-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":6868},{"due_date":"2011-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":6868},{"due_date":"2011-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":6320}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.13},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.12},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.13},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.13},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.12},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.13},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.13},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.12},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.13},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.13},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.73}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":253144,"name":"Fazeelat's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fazeelat is a resident of Okara, a small city located in Punjab, Pakistan.

That\u2019s why she works very hard. \r\n\r\nShe has applied for a loan from Kiva partner Asasah to help her husband in his shoe making business. With the loan he will buy leather, nails and shoe polish in larger quantities. That will enable him to make shoes in bulk quantity to fulfill the orders of his customers and increase his income. He has been in this business for over 10 years. Asma is hopeful that, through an investment, her husband will improve his business further and increase his monthly income. \r\n\r\nShe is a regular loan user of Asasah and this is her second loan application. In her previous loan year, she built good credit behavior and attended every meeting.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":653360,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cobbler","sector":"Services","use":"To buy leather, nails and shoe polish for shoe making business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PK","country":"Pakistan","town":"Raiwind","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"31.254444 74.217778","type":"point"}},"partner_id":60,"posted_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:35Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Asma ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Musarat Bibi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hajran Bibi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PKR","disbursal_amount":60000,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":5484},{"due_date":"2011-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":5484},{"due_date":"2011-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":5484},{"due_date":"2011-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":5484},{"due_date":"2011-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":5484},{"due_date":"2011-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":5484},{"due_date":"2011-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":5484},{"due_date":"2011-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":5484},{"due_date":"2011-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":5484},{"due_date":"2011-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":5484},{"due_date":"2011-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":5160}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.98},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.98},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.98},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.98},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.98},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.98},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.98},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.98},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.98},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.98},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.2}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":63.98,"local_amount":5484,"processed_date":"2010-12-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:25:03Z","rounded_local_amount":5486.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188630600,"comment":null},{"amount":63.98,"local_amount":5484,"processed_date":"2011-01-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T01:37:24Z","rounded_local_amount":5486.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191373503,"comment":null},{"amount":63.98,"local_amount":5484,"processed_date":"2011-02-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:19:04Z","rounded_local_amount":5486.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195790898,"comment":null},{"amount":63.98,"local_amount":5484,"processed_date":"2011-03-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:16:20Z","rounded_local_amount":5486.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201232769,"comment":null},{"amount":63.98,"local_amount":5484,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:13:44Z","rounded_local_amount":5486.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206099174,"comment":null},{"amount":63.98,"local_amount":5484,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:35:09Z","rounded_local_amount":5486.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211169577,"comment":null},{"amount":63.98,"local_amount":5484,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:35:22Z","rounded_local_amount":5486.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216452321,"comment":null},{"amount":63.98,"local_amount":5484,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:18:16Z","rounded_local_amount":5486.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221616276,"comment":null},{"amount":63.98,"local_amount":5484,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:28:51Z","rounded_local_amount":5486.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":226985404,"comment":null},{"amount":63.98,"local_amount":5484,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:20:10Z","rounded_local_amount":5486.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232744249,"comment":null},{"amount":60.2,"local_amount":5160,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:25:57Z","rounded_local_amount":5162.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238548734,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-12-17T00:54:56Z","paid_date":"2011-11-15T09:25:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":253168,"name":"The Nargis Maqsood Masih Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nargis lives in Riwind, a small city in Pakistan known for its dairy industry.

He will utilize the loan to purchase seasonal vegetables in bulk in order to sell more vegetables and make more money. Nazraan is a very helpful and supportive person by nature. She has confidence that her brother will make good use of the money and earn better profits from his business after this investment. \r\n\r\n<p>Nazraan has a daughter, 3 years of age, who has not yet started school. It is her deepest desire to provide quality education for her daughter once she becomes old enough to attend school. Nazraan is a regular lender with Asasah and this is her 4th loan application.

He assists them in meeting their daily needs, getting to work, buying supplies and visiting friends.

the FAWE Girls School. The school is located in Waterloo, a small town where \u201cShine on Sierra Leone\u201d partnered with SMT to start a branch. This school was founded five years ago by Dr. Christiana Thorpe to educate girls, especially war-affected children. Currently, the school is staffed with ten teachers and has an enrollment of 400 pupils. \r\n<p>\r\nThese hardworking and dedicated teachers have come to SMT to seek a loan of 12,700,000 SLL. With the help of this loan, these teachers can embark on some meaningful project that their mere salaries alone cannot do.

She lives in the area named 69-EB, and owns a two-room house where she has been living for more than 25 years.\r\n \r\nKhurshida is the mother of five sons and a daughter. Her eldest son is a government employee, while others are studying in different classes.\r\n \r\nKhurshida is married to S. M., who is a loader by profession and uses a donkey cart for his loading business. He loads different items such as construction supplies and fruits and vegetables and transports the items to the designated places to earn income.\r\n \r\nKhurshida is also involved in an animal sales business, which she does to financially assist her husband. She purchases goats from the animal markets at cheap rates, raises them, and sells them for a profit.\r\n  \r\nShe has applied for a loan from Kiva partner Asasah for her husband\u2019s loading business. With the loan, he will buy a new donkey cart because his old cart has become rough and rotten in some areas, which doesn\u2019t allow him to put a load on it.\r\n  \r\nWith the new cart her husband will provide better services to his clients and do his job better. Khurshida is hopeful that an investment will bring positive changes to her husband\u2019s business and it will help her family to live a better life.\r\n \r\nShe is a new loan applicant of Asasah and hopes the loan will be a good step towards the growth of her husband\u2019s business.\r\n\r\nNote: In the photo, the lady with a book (called Asasah Passbook) is

She has maintained this level and wants to do even better with next loan which she will manage strategically and excellently. With the loan she is going to buy salted fish such as tuna, crovine, sea bass, and also stock up on salted fish produced at Point Noire, such as shark, cod, tuna, prawns, dried crayfish and herrings.\r\n\r\nShe is hoping to make significant profits in order to be able to finish her house and support her children who are in the middle of their studies. She would like to be able to face the various cycles successfully and have savings to achieve her goal. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":562081,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase of salt water fish such as tuna, crovine, catfish and sea bass","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CG","country":"Congo","town":"Brazzaville","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-1 15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":165,"posted_date":"2010-11-29T11:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Denise","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XAF","disbursal_amount":300000,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":17200},{"due_date":"2010-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":17300},{"due_date":"2010-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":17500},{"due_date":"2010-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":17700},{"due_date":"2011-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":17900},{"due_date":"2011-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":18200},{"due_date":"2011-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":18400},{"due_date":"2011-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":18600},{"due_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":18800},{"due_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":19000},{"due_date":"2011-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":19200},{"due_date":"2011-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":19400},{"due_date":"2011-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":19700},{"due_date":"2011-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":19900},{"due_date":"2011-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":20100},{"due_date":"2011-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":21100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.83},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.05},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.45},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.88},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.29},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.92},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.75},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.17},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.58},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.42},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.04},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.46},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.87},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.96}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":145.21,"local_amount":69700,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:24:38Z","rounded_local_amount":71957.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188708600,"comment":null},{"amount":152.29,"local_amount":73100,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:02:27Z","rounded_local_amount":75467.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191446571,"comment":null},{"amount":39.17,"local_amount":18800,"processed_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:55:08Z","rounded_local_amount":19409,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195868242,"comment":null},{"amount":39.58,"local_amount":19000,"processed_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:55:14Z","rounded_local_amount":19615.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195868243,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":19200,"processed_date":"2011-02-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:55:25Z","rounded_local_amount":19821.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195868244,"comment":null},{"amount":40.42,"local_amount":19400,"processed_date":"2011-02-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:55:35Z","rounded_local_amount":20028.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195868245,"comment":null},{"amount":168.33,"local_amount":80800,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:20:57Z","rounded_local_amount":83417.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201309549,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-11-29T17:38:46Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T11:20:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":253336,"name":"Jacqueline","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"              \n\nMaman Jackie pour ses camarade vend le poisson sal\u00e9 depuis plus de 10ans dans le march\u00e9 plateaux des 15ans.\n\nC\u2019est une femme qui maitrise bien son activit\u00e9 car elle connait le haut et le bas  de celui \u2013ci.

A. is a resident of Lahore, Pakistan. It is known for its history and culture. She lives there with her family in a two-room brick house in the area named Fareed town. She moved here 12 years ago. She is the mother of two sons and a daughter. All of them attend school and get an education. \r\n \r\nShamim is a hardworking lady who operates a spice-selling business. She sells salts, pepper and red chili powder to grocery stores and earns income for the family. Her husband\u2019s name is B. A. and he is a bus driver. He drives a government local bus and earns income on a monthly basis. \r\n\r\nShamim has applied for a loan from Kiva partner Asasah for her spice-selling business.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve agricultural production and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve agricultural production and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve agricultural production and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve agricultural production and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He has a shop in the market from which he offers his shoemaking services. \r\n\r\nBano has applied for a loan from Kiva partner Asasah to financially assist her husband in his shoemaking business. With the loan, he will buy leather, nails, and shoe polish in larger quantities in order to make shoes in bulk so that he can fulfill his orders on time and increase his income. He has been engaged in his business for past seven years and Bano is hopeful that her husband\u2019s business will improve further after this loan investment. \r\n\r\nShe is a new loan applicant of Asasah and hopes that it will be a good experience for her.

Her story is representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican clients generally, many of whom recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti. Her group is located in San Pedro D.

In the meantime, she plans to continue enjoying taking care of her children and her house.\r\n\r\nDominga is excited to be taking her 9th loan with Esperanza after having successfully repaid her previous loan and grown her business. She has had her business for over 9 years, starting by selling in a table in her home, and then moving her business to a local market. She operates a Fruit and Vegetables stand. She plans to use this loan to invest in her business by buying vegetables, plantains, bananas, sweet potatoes, cassava, etc. She will use the profits to invest in her business and buy some materials to improve her business.\r\n\r\nThis Esperanza associate began with us because she wants to have an improved business. Her story is representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican clients generally, many of whom recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti. Her group is located in San Pedro D.

Women\u00b4s Bank Of Forging Goals And Dreams Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The Women's Bank of Forging Goals and Dreams is comprised of six women members who live and work in Jaris, San Jose, in the central valley of Costa Rica. Historically, the members of this group have demonstrated their ability to fulfill their loan repayment responsibilities while undergoing difficulties within the group. During the lifespan of a prior loan, some group members faced challenges in making repayments. Despite this internal problem, the group as a whole was never late making repayments, i.e. the members banded together in solidarity to ensure the group was on time with their repayments. The loan consultant who has been working with this group over the years has described the members as hardworking entrepreneurs. \r\n<br>Jaris is a rural community with poor access to full-time job opportunities. The main methods of subsistence are through activities in agricultural production such as the rearing of pigs and the production of sugar cane, among others. The women of this group are unanimously involved in the rearing and sale of pork products. This loan will be used by each group member to make investments in livestock, animal feed, nutrients and construction materials (to build pig pens). \r\n<br>Flora V. S. is the elected president of this group. Flora is a 55-year-old mother of eight who lives with her family in Jaris. She dedicates the mornings and afternoons to the care of her livestock. She feeds and cleans her pigs twice a day, when necessary, and her husband helps her. When she isn't taking care of the animals, Flora is carrying out various household responsibilities, including cooking and cleaning. The rearing of pigs is the sole source of family income for Flora and her family. \r\n<br>Flora's goals are to be able to earn enough income from the sale of pork products to enable the provision of a higher standard of living for her family. An obstacle she faces is the fluctuating prices for nutrients, pig food and livestock. An increase in prices for any one of these will eat away at her profits, as will a decrease in the market value of pork products. \r\n<br>The members of this group have been able to access credit, as well as favorable loan conditions, through the group lending model. In traditional financial institutions, a loan guarantor is needed in order to be approved for a loan. With the group lending model, each member acts as a guarantor for another member, which makes it easier for the poor to access loans. The women have grown to know each other on a deep and personal level, as they have lived in the same community for most of their lives. As a group, each woman makes a guarantee to make repayments and support others if they have trouble making repayments. This will be the group's fourth loan with Kiva partner, Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer. Over the years, the members have observed loans contributing to an overall improvement in living conditions, enabling mothers to better support their children's studies, good health and livelihoods. The women of this group act as a support network for one another. Monthly meetings and group activities allow the women to take a break from their daily routines, contribute to a positive change in their community, and provide an opportunity to get together with other women. Working together on various problems, whether they are rooted in family or business, has allowed the women to develop feelings of solidarity and strength within the group.

She has had her business for four years, which started as a stand offering candies and snacks. Now, she operates a 'colmado,' a place where you can find all the ingredients to make your daily food.

She is a proud single mother of 4 children but currently only lives with one of them: Marco, aged 11.  She educates and raises her son in her own home which is located in the town of Palca.  As a single mother, she confirms that she has a lot of strength and vitality for getting ahead in life.  \u201cI have to work twice as hard and be an example for my children\u201d she comments.\r\n\r\nThrough her hard work and determination, she has managed to get most of her children ahead in life, since farming is her main support.  She grows potatoes, peas and other vegetables which make her a good income each harvest season.  Carmen has been in this business for 5 years and the wholesale purchasers in the central market of the city of Tarma know her as a determined and optimistic woman.\r\n\r\nHowever, in order to support the university education of her other children, two years ago Carmen also started selling sweetened apple water and other drinks made from 'maca' flour and soya flour which she sells together with pieces of bread.

Gloria happily tells us that she feels satisfied helping her husband to cover their household expenses since when she was a little girl her parents taught her how to farm and, as it is a family tradition, she never stopped.\r\n\r\nFour years ago Gloria inherited a plot of farmland where she grows potatoes, peas and lettuces which she sells after each harvest to the middlemen who constantly visit her land.  However, 3 years ago Gloria had an idea.  She decided to start buying flowers wholesale and take them to the capital since the market there is a good one and the profits are better.  Now she travels there once a week and as her new business is doing very well she is thinking of buying a truck which would enable her to travel more easily.\r\n\r\nThis is Gloria's third loan with MFP and, as a member of her community bank, she is proud of the bank's members who are responsible and determined women.  She will use her loan to buy 2 bags of pea seeds and will invest the rest of the money in buying gladioli wholesale."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":654169,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy 2 bags of pea seeds and to buy gladioli wholesale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:39Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gloria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1075}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1075,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:13:51Z","rounded_local_amount":3019.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221718284,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-12-08T05:24:48Z","paid_date":"2011-08-15T09:13:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":253454,"name":"Jane","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jane is 29 years old.

She makes 'chicha' (a soft drink made from corn) and soft drinks in general.  She also sells various merchandise and cylinders of gas which she provides to restaurants and housewives.  Mar\u00eda started out selling various merchandise such as clothes and costume jewelry which she currently sells directly.  She also makes 'chicha' which she distributes through two people who sell her product in all the surrounding districts in Nelson Mandela neighborhood of the city of Cartagena where she lives with her husband and four children aged 19 to 30.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda is very much aware of opportunities and as she saw that natural gas doesn't reach these areas, she started selling cylinders of gas so that when housewives find this product, which they use every day, has run out (a cylinder lasts about a month), they come to her to buy more.  They bring empty cylinders and Mar\u00eda gives them full ones.  In this way, the housewives don't have to stop preparing meals for their families.  She also supplies small restaurants and fast food places who already know of her business.\r\n\r\nThis is Mar\u00eda's fifteenth loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and she will use her Kiva loan to buy merchandise for which she has orders from her customers in this end-of-year season and also cylinders of gas because, as is the case every year, during this season they are in short supply since Christmas parties mean that a lot of food is prepared.  She has many orders which restaurants have already made with her in advance.\r\n\r\nSince she joined our organization,  Mar\u00eda has managed to use her loans to increase her work and responsibility and to buy her own house since the one she lived in before was rented.  She now dreams of improving her home, providing it with better building materials.  She also has a future goal of opening a soft drinks store to make more income although she still doesn't have the working capital that this requires and she will need to work to achieve

She grows peas, potatoes and a wide variety of flowers.  She sells each harvest in the capital, where she travels once a week.  Alicia confirms that she should have harvested her flowers in November but due to weather problems the harvest was delayed.

Each individual member is involved in a commercial activity such as sewing or various types of sales (shoes, clothing, jewelry, livestock and catalogue items). Each woman will use this loan to make general investments in their productive activity. For example, to purchase chickens, animal feed, or various merchandise for sale. As the Christmas season is upon us, many Costa Ricans will be making gift purchases this month. This represents an opportunity for these women to increase their revenues.  \r\n\r\nMaria Ofelia, the elected president of this group, is a 63-year-old mother of 8 who lives by herself in Paso Canoas. Maria has a sewing business. She produces bedding such as sheets, blankets and pillow covers. She sews during the daytime and at night she prepares the projects she plans to work on for the next day. \r\n\r\nThe community of Paso Canoas is plagued by poverty, partially due to a serious lack of job opportunities. Maria\u2019s goal is to create a better living situation for herself, her fellow group members, as well as strive to provide employment opportunities in the community at large. Her main obstacle has been a lack of access to working capital. This loan will help to address this issue. \r\n\r\nThe members of The Women\u2019s Bank of Dorcas know each other from living in the same community and from meetings at the local church. Maria says the main benefit of receiving a loan from Fundacion Mujer is the low interest rate that will be charged, as compared to other financial institutions.

He has had his business for five years, starting it with some savings he had. He plans to use this loan to invest in his business by buying iron and metal pieces to resell to industries. He will use the profits to reinvest in his business and increase his capital. \r\n\r\nMarino began with Esperanza because he needed capital for his business.
