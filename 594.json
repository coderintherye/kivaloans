But her capital funds gradually increased and with it she purchased a freezer to keep and conserve her products. Her sales increased when she joined her business to the market and the stores still buy from her. All of these achievements have been realized with her efforts and with the help of 3 loans she has had from Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo (Kiva Field Partner). Her Kiva loan will be her fourth and with it she will purchase boxes of beer, she will condition her store, and she will purchase a transportation harness and other equipment. She now has 2 businesses and she has reconditioned only one of them. Her businesses are located in two different locations but one of them only operates on the weekends. She earns an additional source of income by working as a helper at a bakery. Her business enjoys a good presentation and reputation and today her dream is to have a bakery. Her husband will be able to employ his knowledge and to work in his vocation to earn an income for the family. This is obviously her greatest goal.

It is equipped with all the services (water, electricity, and sewage) and it is located in the urban region of Olmos. It is known for its agricultural and farming activities.\r\n\r\nJuan's business has been public transportation for some time. His route is from Olmos to the different communities and vice versa. He also has a motorcycle that allows him to reach his farm land quicker. There he cultivates lemons. These activities help him have a greater income to cover the household expenses and to have a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nWhen Juan saw that his businesses have prospered he took an opportunity to request a loan from Edpyme Alternativa (Kiva Field Partner) in the amount of 500 nuevos soles. He will purchase fertilizers to improve the quality of his products and he will also provide maintenance care to his farm land. When he obtains a quality product he will be able to ask a better price from the merchants who purchase the lemon. And so this will progressively improve the quality of his life and he will continue to help him other in whatever is needed. \r\n\r\nJuan is a very hard working person who is responsible and a good son for ensuring that his mother not want for anything."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":767881,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase fertilizers and to maintain his farm land.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Olmos - Lambayeque","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2011-05-13T18:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan Jorge","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-04-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":76.56},{"due_date":"2011-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":79.57},{"due_date":"2011-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":82.14},{"due_date":"2011-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":84.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":87.32},{"due_date":"2011-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":89.91}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.62},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.83},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.86},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.8},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.93},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.96}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":30.62,"local_amount":76.56,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:59:54Z","rounded_local_amount":85.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211211219,"comment":null},{"amount":31.83,"local_amount":79.57,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:53:23Z","rounded_local_amount":88.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216489461,"comment":null},{"amount":32.86,"local_amount":82.14,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-19T07:43:15Z","rounded_local_amount":91.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":222205624,"comment":null},{"amount":33.8,"local_amount":84.5,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-16T08:04:28Z","rounded_local_amount":94.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227182365,"comment":null},{"amount":34.93,"local_amount":87.32,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:44:15Z","rounded_local_amount":97.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232779335,"comment":null},{"amount":35.96,"local_amount":89.91,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:47:58Z","rounded_local_amount":100.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238583886,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-05-15T23:43:18Z","paid_date":"2011-11-15T09:47:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":297645,"name":"Charles","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Charles M. is 35 years old and lives in the town of Kireka in the Kampala central region of Uganda.

She lives in her own home and what she wishes for more than anything is to do well in life.  For some years she has been embroidering dresses.  This is an activity that takes practically all day since she must be very meticulous in putting the finishing touches to her work.  The way Ana works is that she receives orders from different salespeople who provide her with a certain quantity of garments for her to decorate with different and original embroidery work.

She is married, but does not have any children. Her husband is a service provider.  She loves trading, especially as a source of livelihood. She sells fish and meat to households and food vendors in her town, Berekum, in northern Ghana. Fish and meat are commonly used animal proteins in the preparation of soups and sauces in many households and food establishments in Ghana. Their trade is, indeed, a lucrative source of income for many women like Dora.  She has sold fish and meat for the past three years. She plans to use the loan to purchase assorted fish and meat in cartons to fill her demand.

Her neighbors had to go to the center of town to buy the school supplies they needed so she understood that they would welcome a local business.

Jeniffer's 8th round at the community bank and she is a happy member because past loans have greatly helped her partner's business.\r\n\r\nSra. Jennifer's dream is to own a well-built house, very unlike the one she and her family live in now.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":765269,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Phone Accessories","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy phone supplies for a retail business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2011-05-14T17:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":775,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jeniffer Pamela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":770,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":96.25},{"due_date":"2011-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":96.25},{"due_date":"2011-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":96.25},{"due_date":"2011-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":96.25},{"due_date":"2011-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":96.25},{"due_date":"2011-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":96.25},{"due_date":"2011-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":96.25},{"due_date":"2011-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":96.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.88},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.87},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.88},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.87},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.88},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.87},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.88},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":96.88,"local_amount":96.25,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:13:44Z","rounded_local_amount":96.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211225321,"comment":null},{"amount":193.75,"local_amount":192.5,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:04:58Z","rounded_local_amount":193.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216504112,"comment":null},{"amount":193.75,"local_amount":192.5,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:48:16Z","rounded_local_amount":193.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221668057,"comment":null},{"amount":193.75,"local_amount":192.5,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T09:09:17Z","rounded_local_amount":193.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227036806,"comment":null},{"amount":96.87,"local_amount":96.25,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:03:13Z","rounded_local_amount":96.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232797377,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-05-16T10:26:03Z","paid_date":"2011-10-15T09:03:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":297845,"name":"Heng","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Heng Y., 49, is a villager who lives in the Baray district of Kompong Tom province.

people aim for simplicity, because as Richard Bach once said, \u201cThe simplest things are often the truest.\u201d This principle is evident in the life of Jennifer S., 33. Jennifer is married to Lino, a security guard. Together they are raising two children, one of whom is in elementary school, while the other is still too young to attend school. They have been living in Silang, Cavite the last five years.\r\n\r\nJennifer has a sari-sari (variety) store which she operates on her own every day. It is her daily task to check on which items and which specific brands her customers prefer. After her three years of experience in this kind of micro enterprise, she knows the tastes of her customers and earns PHP9,000 monthly.\r\n\r\nTo help her use the information she has, she is requesting a PHP10,000 loan. She will use it increase her inventory of the most popular items, such as  rice, canned goods, soft drinks, and other daily essentials. \r\n\r\nIt is inevitable for sari-sari store owners to have customers who do not pay their debts. But Jennifer strives to get past this challenge to make her life simpler and better. As much as she wants her business to grow, she desires to have another baby and to lead a simple life. As a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship* meetings where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay micro finance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":768246,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy additional merchandise for her store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Silang, Cavite","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-05-13T02:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jennifer","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-04-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":3333.35,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:49:40Z","rounded_local_amount":3573.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211195068,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:43:19Z","rounded_local_amount":2859.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216474109,"comment":null},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":3333.35,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:31:46Z","rounded_local_amount":3573.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221636890,"comment":null},{"amount":16.67,"local_amount":666.62,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:40:44Z","rounded_local_amount":714.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227005201,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-05-15T12:34:43Z","paid_date":"2011-09-15T08:40:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":297886,"name":"Puspa Kencana Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ni Putu, 27, is the leader of the group called Puspa Kencana, consisting of 10 members.

Also, three bright futures are in their hands as they take care of three children. Together, they live in Silang, Cavite, Philippines.\r\n\r\nRosalinda owns a sari-sari (variety) store.

She has been in this micro business for three years now, and she earns around PHP11,000 monthly.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue running her business, she applied for a PHP30,000 loan. She will use this money to buy another computer to meet the demands of her clients. Also, she will purchase grocery items to add to her store shelves. Rosalinda is grateful for the help being extended to her business, as it is what keeps her family up and going every day.\r\n\r\nBeing a sari-sari store owner, it is difficult for her to follow up with customers who have long lists of debts. But Rosalinda continues to devise strategies to meet this difficulty. Rosalinda also aims to save enough for old age. As a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship* meetings where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay micro finance

Apolonia D., 42, believes in this and incorporates it in her beliefs, business, and lifestyle. Apolonia finished a degree in AB Library Science in college, and is married to Nelson, a driver. She is also an active community partner of CCT*. Two children were born into their family, one is studying in elementary school and one who is not yet of school age. Their family resides in Munting Ilog, Silang, Cavite.\r\n\r\nAt present, Apolonia is focusing on growing her businesses\u2014 a public transportation business and an agricultural garden grown for profit. Each day her husband goes out to provide transportation services to people in their community. The fruits, vegetables, and ornamental plants being grown in her agricultural garden are being sold in the market for profit. Apolonia has been doing this for ten years now. Every month, her perseverance yields her an average of Php11,900.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, Apolonia is requesting a loan of 19,000 PHP.  She believes that this is one step to take in order for her to grow her business. She sees applying for this loan as a great help to her. With the loan money on hand, she intends to buy essential materials for her jeepney transport business. She will purchase wheels and other spare parts for the improvement and maintenance of the vehicle. Apolonia sees this loan as a great opportunity for growth, and she prays that the Lord will continually bless those people whom He uses to bless her and her family.\r\n\r\nIt becomes a real challenge to Apolonia whenever the jeepney goes under repair, since it is one of their main source of business income. But she refuses to back down and finds ways to solve the dilemma. Apolonia believes that soon, her business will grow, even the agricultural garden she grows for additional profit. Above everything else, she prays that her children will grow to become successful in completing their education. As a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay micro finance

Ann","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As a community partner in CCT,* Joy Ann F. proves to the world that not having any tertiary (post-secondary) education cannot stop her from living life to its fullest. At 38, Joy Ann heads a family with her husband George, a policeman. She and George have three children; two are attending school, while the third is too young to study. They used to live in Davao City, but currently they live in Ascoville, Caloocan City, Metro Manila.\r\n\r\nJoy Ann finds fellowship in CCT as a sari-sari (variety) store owner, like many of her fellow community partners. Her store is located next to the family home, and she sells daily essentials such as beverages, detergents, and candies. Part of her inventory is electronic loads from different service providers for mobile phones (i.e., prepaid cell phone credits, mainly used for text messaging). She has been in business for three years now, and every month she earns around 11,000 Philippine pesos (PHP).\r\n\r\nTo help her take her business to the next level, she has applied for a loan of 10,000 PHP. She will invest the money in buying sacks of rice, which are always in demand in the Philippines, and supplies of electronic load. Receiving a loan encourages her to earn more and grow her business.\r\n\r\nRunning a sari-sari store during rainy seasons is a challenge for Joy Ann because only a few customers go out to her store when it rains. Nevertheless, she prefers to seek encouragement rather than focus on the obstacles along her way. She believes that God will enable her to succeed on a long-term basis and be of great help to others, free from the strong hold of the past and living her life to the fullest.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is married, and has four children living with him.  Abd has a falafel restaurant. Falafel is a ball or patty made from ground chickpeas and\/or fava beans. Falafel is usually served in a pita, which acts as a pocket, or wrapped in a flatbread known as lafa. The falafel balls are topped with salads, pickled vegetables, hot sauce, and drizzled with tahini-based sauces. Falafel balls may also be eaten alone as a snack or served as part of a \"meze\".\r\n\r\nGenerally accepted to have first been made in Egypt,where the dish is widely known as \u0637\u0639\u0645\u064a\u0629 (ta'amiya) in Egyptian Arabic, falafel has become a dish eaten throughout the Middle East.The Copts of Egypt claim to have first made the dish as a replacement for meat during Lent. The hearty fritters are now found around the world as a replacement for meat and as a form of street food.\r\n\r\nAbd has been working at preparing and selling falafel since 1985. His customers include community members from his region, in addition to tourists and passers-by. Abd  says that he is passionate about his work and that he could not imagine a life without it, because it introduces him to different populations and  cultures, and it provides his family with a good enough income  to satisfy his family's needs.\r\n\r\nAbd is requesting a loan from Kiva partner Al Majmoua. This will be his eleventh loan from Al Majmoua. In addition to a soft drink refrigerator, he is planning to buy new specialized machine for preparing falafel, necessary to increase his production since his machines are old and not as efficient as they used to be. He says that without the loan, he would not be able to provide the same level of support for his family. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Abd says that he is planning to further expand and improve his business as much as possible."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1660,"image":{"id":768327,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"To buy a new specialized Falafel machine, in addition to a soft drink refrigerator.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"LB","country":"Lebanon","town":"Beirut","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"33.871944 35.509722","type":"point"}},"partner_id":77,"posted_date":"2011-05-13T13:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Abd ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-04-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":2000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2011-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2011-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2011-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2011-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2011-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2011-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2011-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2012-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2012-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2012-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":174}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":174}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":166,"local_amount":166,"processed_date":"2011-05-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:23:57Z","rounded_local_amount":166,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211153931,"comment":null},{"amount":166,"local_amount":166,"processed_date":"2011-06-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:27:32Z","rounded_local_amount":166,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216438846,"comment":null},{"amount":166,"local_amount":166,"processed_date":"2011-07-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:07:31Z","rounded_local_amount":166,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221603537,"comment":null},{"amount":166,"local_amount":166,"processed_date":"2011-08-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:13:18Z","rounded_local_amount":166,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":226972964,"comment":null},{"amount":166,"local_amount":166,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:10:30Z","rounded_local_amount":166,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232731078,"comment":null},{"amount":166,"local_amount":166,"processed_date":"2011-10-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:13:02Z","rounded_local_amount":166,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238534618,"comment":null},{"amount":166,"local_amount":166,"processed_date":"2011-11-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:07:01Z","rounded_local_amount":166,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244494140,"comment":null},{"amount":166,"local_amount":166,"processed_date":"2011-12-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:09:35Z","rounded_local_amount":166,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250702239,"comment":null},{"amount":166,"local_amount":166,"processed_date":"2012-01-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:19:19Z","rounded_local_amount":166,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257299149,"comment":null},{"amount":166,"local_amount":166,"processed_date":"2012-02-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:17:35Z","rounded_local_amount":166,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263317079,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-05-30T00:26:33Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":297933,"name":"Jackson","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jackson W.

Pig rearing is something he has been into for a long time now and he knows how to go about it. John Fonyam has also attended training sessions on pig farming provided by local and international NGOs.\r\n\r\nThe major problem facing pig farmers now is the African swine fever but with the proper hygiene and vaccine, this can be avoided. \r\n \r\nOf all locally reared animals, pigs are the most demanded and the most expensive, assuring him of a ready market at the end. \r\n\r\nThe profit he gets from the loan will be used to educate his children and provide food for his family. He prefers a loan from GHAPE because of the long recovery period, which enables him to repay without stress.\r\n\r\nAbout GHAPE \r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon. GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach. Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.

GHAPE instils a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":195.1,"image":{"id":768353,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

Aside from selling daily essentials such asseasonings and canned goods, Olivia also sells feeds for pig raisers. She earns money from this business since many in her community raise pigs for a living. With a store in the village where she lives in, Olivia earns 7,200 a month. Being a hardworking micro entrepreneur, Olivia gains training on business as well as spiritual nourishment from fellowships in CCT. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operation of her business, Olivia is requesting a loan for 20,000 PHP, which she will use to purchase more stocks of feeds for sale to pig raisers, as well as cases of soft drinks and boxes of grocery items, such as detergents and canned tuna, for her store. Olivia says that the loan will support her in gaining her strength no matter what situation her business might get into.\r\n\r\nOne challenge Olivia faces is whenever storms arise, which happen frequently in the Philippines. This leads to fewer customers and thus less income. The rains prevent her from making money on a daily basis, but she is learning to accept whatever challenge life might give her. This is because her main inspiration is her children, whom she wants to finish their schooling. It is her ultimate desire for her family to prosper.  As a CCT Community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship meeting where she can draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\nAll CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.

Humphred","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nguh Hunphred M. was born on the 20th of August, 1968. He is married and a father of five children, who are all above the age of fifteen. He lives in a six-bedroom house with his wife and six children. He is resident in Tudig, a village in Momo Division in the North West Region of Cameroon.\r\n\r\nHunphred\u2019s father died, leaving the entire family responsibilities on him and making things very difficult for him. It has not been easy with him at all since his father died and he has been having very difficult times due to poverty and lack of the means to take care of his family. He has received and repaid loans from GHAPE twice.  \r\n\r\nHe joined GHAPE in 2008 and used the first loan on a restaurant business. The second loan was used to pay his children\u2019s school fees. He says that GHAPE has helped him to educate his children because he used the profit from his loans to educate his children. His standard of living and that of his family has greatly increased ever since he joined GHAPE.\r\n\r\nHe intends to use this third loan to construct a house part of which he will rent out to tenants and part to do his own business. He is very convinced that this business is going to succeed because the plot is located close to the road and there is high demand for houses close to the road. He will use the profit from this business to expand his business, provide medication for his family, and pay school fees for his children.\r\n\r\nHe prefers a GHAPE loan because of the frequent training he receives and also because the interest rate is lower as compared to other financial institutions in Cameroon. Also, the loan is repaid in bits, making it very easy on the member.\r\n\r\nAbout GHAPE \r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instils a sense of family and community in its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":195.1,"image":{"id":768400,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Property","sector":"Housing","use":"to build a rental house.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Mbengwi, NW.

P., 42, is another persevering community partner of CCT*. Running a micro business of her own, Rosalinda also keeps a marriage with Wilfredo, a taxi driver. Together they have two children who are both in college. Their family resides in Caloocan City, Metro Manila.\r\n\r\nRaising pigs for sale is the main business of Rosalinda. This business works well because the community consumes pork almost every day. Aside from this, she also buys quality materials like household items, clothes, and accessories and sells them for a  profit. This business is also referred to as Ready-to-Wear (RTW) business.  Rosalinda has juggled these two businesses for two years now and manages to do so without hiring employees. She earns around Php 11,600 monthly.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her businesses, she is requesting a 24,000 PHP loan. Rosalinda observes that her finances need to be leveled up in order for her to purchase more than the usual quantities of clothes, accessories, and household items for sale. She also plans to use the loan in purchasing sufficient feed for her pigs to grow healthy. Rosalinda says that the loan helps her a lot in striving more to achieve more.\r\n\r\nCalamities are a primary struggle for Rosalinda, as these are something she has no control over. However, she stays strong in the Lord, knowing that the love of the Lord will sustain her and will shower His blessings upon her. She continually prays for peace and harmonious relationships with her family and loved ones.  As a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay micro finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":768406,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to pay for

A. is married and has four children. She lives in Acha, a small farming village in the North West Region of Cameroon. Due to ill health, she spent much of her business capital in the hospital. Motivated by other GHAPE members in her community, she joined the program in 2008. Since then, she has been trying to support her family through the loans she received form GHPAE. With this new loan, she plans to buy more palm oil and beans (cheap this season) to resell in the coming months when the prices will have gone up. This is a business she has been doing for a long time; palm oil is an indispensible commodity used in the preparation of almost every meal. Members of her community will no longer have to wait untill market day to have palm oil as most of them always buy in small quantities as needed. She will use the profit from the loan to pay school fees for her children and provide food and medication for her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GHAPE: The Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.

like constructing a building takes ultimate effort, making a business grow has to be striven for. Making a micro-enterprise grow at the age of 56, Nenita Pate\u0148o indeed works hard. She finished college and is married to Jaime, a carpenter. Their family lives in Caloocan City, Metro Manila. She is also a hardworking community partner in CCT*, where she regularly attends fellowship and receives entrepreneurial training.\r\n\r\nNenita focuses on her sari-sari (variety) store. With this, she meets the daily needs of her neighborhood, those menial ones like a sachet of shampoo, a small pack of seasoning, or a bottle of cold soft drink. She also has spent 15 years in this type of business and is well aware of the strategies needed to make it work in her community. Aside from selling retail products in her store, Nenita is also into realty development. Every month she is able to earn Php10,000.\r\n\r\nOne step she has thought of to help her build her micro-business is to apply for a Php15,000 loan. This will primarily help her boost her sari-sari store by including more varieties of products and diverse brands to accommodate the differing tastes of her customers. She believes that this loan will be a great support to her business capital. With your help, Nenita is another step nearer her success in business.\r\n\r\nRegarding challenges, Nenita mentioned that demolition, poverty, and calamities in one way affect her business and peace of mind. Nevertheless, her principle stands, and that is to \u201cstrive more so that you can earn more.\u201d It is her dream for her business to grow and expand, so that she can be of great help to her dear family. Now, put simply, that is another facet of her life that she has to build with ultimate effort.  As a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":768438,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to pay

the age of 34, Den-den B. knows just how important savings are in preparation for the future. This is the reason that she makes effort to assure that her business will go smoothly and earn sufficient profits. Denden is married to Benjamin, a barber. They are raising two children who are both in elementary level. Their family resides in Caloocan City, Metro Manila.\r\n\r\nCapitalizing on the occupation of her husband, Denden has begun her own barber shop and has run it with Benjamin. The shop is located along Araneta Avenue, Quezon City. Having been six years in this business, Den-den learned the strategies in making a barber shop function effectively and gain more customers. She also applies the entrepreneurial trainings she receives from CCT* as she gets encouraged weekly by attending its fellowship* meetings. Every month she is able to earn roughly Php11,000.\r\n\r\nDen-den applies for a loan worth Php20,000 to help her grow her business. This she will utilize by purchasing necessary equipment and materials for the barber shop. Denden also says that part of the loan will go to her savings. She will make sure that all she needs for the optimum functioning of the shop will be purchased so that more profits would go to her savings.\r\n\r\nOne major challenge Den-den faces is demolition in the place where she is supposed to branch out her business. Currently she is devising plans on where to locate her to-be-opened store. This is one step towards her goal of owning both a big salon and a well-known barber shop. She works hard to make this dream happen, because the bottom line is, a successful business will mean sufficient savings to secure the future of her children. It is her ultimate desire to see her children finish their education.\r\n\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":768443,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Barber

Earlier, he was into cattle rearing but thieves broke into his farm and made away with all of his cattle. He then turned to GHAPE for assistance in the year 2004. He has received and successfully managed and repaid GHAPE loans four times. He presently has an old motorbike taxi which is the main source of income for him and his family at the moment. \r\n\r\nGiven this new loan, he plans to sell his old motorbike and add the money to the loan to enable him to buy a new one. Motorcycle taxis are the most popular means of transportation in his community as the roads are very bad. The profit he obtains from the loan shall be used to increase the living standard of his family and pay school fees for his children.\r\n\r\nAbout GHAPE \r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.

He is married to Sophina Nato and he is the father of eight children, with only one child below fifteen years of age. He lives in a five-bedroom apartment with his family. He lives in Tudig, a village in Momo division in the North West Region of Cameroon.\r\n\r\nPoverty has been his major setback in life. Due to encouragement from a friend who is a GHAPE member, he joined GHAPE in 2008. The first loan he received was used to buy pigs. He used the profit from that project to sponsor two of his children in the university and one in technical high school. He needs a loan this time which he intends to use to buy pigs, goats, and feed for his animal farm. He is convinced this business will succeed because he is very well versed in the business and knows that they reproduce very fast. He intends to use his proceeds to expand his farm, buy medicine for his children, and to continue to sponsor them in school.\r\n\r\nLucas confesses that ever since he joined GHAPE, his life has never been the same again. The poverty he used to suffer is gradually going away and his children\u2019s school fees have never been a problem again.\r\n\r\nHe prefers a loan from GHAPE because the time for reimbursement is longer and the interest rate is relatively lower.\r\n\r\nAbout GHAPE \r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instils a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":195.1,"image":{"id":768454,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

She does this work mainly in the mornings because she is a mother and head of household for her three-month-old twins. She must give them most of her time because they need not only her care and attention, but also to be with her constantly.\r\n \r\nVanessa buys the desserts from a supplier and then distributes them to the many stores that buy from her daily or weekly. Her children are her big motivation; because of them, she is motivated to work everyday and to keep striving because she hopes to offer them a better quality of life. However, her work has several problems. One of them is transporting the desserts, which sometimes affects their quality. For this reason Vanessa needs to buy at least two coolers, which will enable her to transport her products easily and comfortably. She will also be able to buy more products, thus generating more profit, but unfortunately she does not have the capital she needs for this investment that will allow her to increase her
