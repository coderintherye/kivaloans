It is for this reason that a brother of hers helped her get a loan which Sonia used to open her small general store.

That's why he learned this work easily. Now he has two parcels of his own land, where he grows coffee and plantains. \r\n\r\nWhen he has time available, he works weekends as a day laborer on other parcels. Dino is persevering and a worker by nature. He began to harvest coffee a year ago, obtaining six sacks. This year, he is confident that his production will be greater.  Moreover, his plantain trees yield around 300 kilos every two weeks, which he sells for 30 centimos a kilo. \r\n\r\nDino feels free working on his crops, and that's why he will keep investing in this business. Now he is waiting patiently for three years for his recently planted cacao to produce its first harvest. \r\n\r\nDino would receive his first loan from MFP, so he promises to pay his monthly installments on time.\r\n\r\nHe belongs to the \"Inkani\u201d communal bank, and feels happy to have as co-members, people who are responsible; just as he is.  When he gets the money, Dino will be able to buy farming tools such as machetes and files for clearing his parcels. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1019684,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy tools such as machetes and files.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-04-03T19:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-03T19:10:02Z","loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dino ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-04-08T03:43:57Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":406417,"name":"George","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"George is a 37-year-old married man with three children.

This will help her to finish the construction on her small house and improve the living conditions for herself and her child."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1030301,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to rent pasture land for her dairy cows\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Cochabamba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.383333 -66.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":140,"posted_date":"2012-04-03T20:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-03T20:20:03Z","loan_amount":1200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Eliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":8200,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":341.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":341.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":341.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":341.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":341.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":341.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":341.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":341.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":341.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":341.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":341.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":341.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":341.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":341.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":341.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":341.67},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":341.67},{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":341.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":341.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":341.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":341.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":341.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":341.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":341.59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.01},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.99}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-04-07T06:40:31Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":404283,"name":"Maria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda tiene 53 a\u00f1os, es una mujer divorciada.

She switched to one with more capacity with a loan from MFP.\r\n \r\nShe considers her business to be very profitable because the earnings it brings her and the ease she has doing it. She decided to start her business so she could get ahead with her spouse and when her son came along she really wanted to offer him a better quality of life. Because of this and seeing the good results, she hopes in the future to open a mini-market in her house with a variety of products to sell. \r\n \r\nThis will be her 4th loan with the MFP institution. She hopes to have your cooperation to continue with her goals. That is why she is committed to making her payments in order to have a good credit history. With the 1500 nuevos soles she has asked for, she will invest in buying school supplies to sell and a new copier valued at 1000 nuevos soles. She seeks to expand her business and make it grow.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1022083,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"to buy a photocopier and school supplies.

She has 3 children, but lives with only two of them who are aged 25 and 20.  Sofa has her own house in the Malambo neighborhood of the Huasahuasi \u2013 Tarma district.  Sofa is a woman who never rests.  In spite the fact that she is older, she continues to devote herself to doing what she enjoys, which is farming.  Ever since she was young she has cultivated potatoes and vegetables.  But the work that suits her best is buying and selling potatoes, peas, carrots, lettuce, etc.  She started doing this 2 years ago. \"Before I used to farm, but it is tiring.  Now I travel to Chanchamayo (in the central forest) to sell,\" she says.  Every week, Sofa acquires 20 sacks of potatoes, 10 sacks of peas and some vegetables.  Her children help her with this work, and because of this she is comfortable with this activity.  She sells all of this merchandise from a sales post in the Chanchamayo market.  In addition, for 5 years she has also been making cheese.  Each week she sells 80 cheese molds.  She is content with her work, because this is the way that she has been supporting her family over all of this time.  \r\n\r\nSofa hopes to continue with these businesses and improve her sales.  This will be her 12th loan with MFP, and she pledges to be punctual with her loan payments.

","en":"Gulzat is 35 years old, married and is raising three school age children. While looking for a source of income for her family Gulzat started her business in 2008 doing animal husbandry with a starting capital of 20,000 som (KGS). Today Gulzat's business has one horse, five sheep, five goats and two cows bringing around 10,000 KGS monthly from the sale of milk and dairy products. The desire to save some money for her children's education pushed Gulzat to expand her business and open a food stall. With the goal to increase her working capital Gulzat has come to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan in the amount of 75,000 KGS which will let her expand the variety of products and acquire new customers. Gulzat plans to partially invest the income from the loan to buy building materials to build a shed for the livestock and partially into the growth of her retail business.\r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":75,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1063436,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"to expand the variety of products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Ak-Talaa village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-04-04T01:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-04T01:30:03Z","loan_amount":1625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gulzat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":75000,"loan_amount":1625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":35000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":758.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":402727,"name":"Mardo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mardo, de 39 a\u00f1os de edad, es un hombre trabajador y emprendedor, adem\u00e1s de ser amable y cordial.

However, her fighting spirit and desire to succeed have allowed her to overcome the difficulties and continue moving forward with her business.  \r\n\r\nLuz Mery is seeking a loan that will enable her to purchase accessories such as chairs, wash units, brushes and other items, to better equip her beauty salon.\r\n\r\nLuz Mery hopes that this way her monthly income will not be impacted in order to get these accessories. She also hopes that her income will subsequently increase considerably, as she will be able to offer her customers better service. Luz Mery dreams about her business providing her with economic opportunities and allowing her to offer her two children and her husband a better quality of life.\r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1019465,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","use":"To buy accessories such as chairs, wash units, brushes and other items, to better equip her beauty salon.

She is a mother in a very hardworking family, and she sacrifices everything for her three children (ages 12, 8 and 4), whom she has to educate and feed alone because she is a single mother.  She lives in her parents\u2019 home with her children and a brother, whose family is also living there.\r\n\r\nCelfita\u2019s job consists of the sale of clothing.  She brings the clothing from the city of Lima and she goes to the market that is the closest to her house to offer her products as a street vendor.  She has been working like this for three years.  She does this alone, because since she separated from her spouse, she has had to find a way to provide food and education to her children.  \r\n\r\nDuring this period of working, she has succeeded in learning what her customers are looking for and it is for this reason that she always has a design or model  that her customers love.  She likes this job, since she has time to participate in other activities.  Also, since it is a very busy market, she always has sales, although there are good days and some bad ones.  She knows that she has to work hard, and since she is persistent, she always brings something home to her family.  She hopes that at some point she will have her clothing store, where she can do a better job of attending to her customers and offer them more comfort.  \r\n\r\nThis will be loan number three with MFP, so she hopes that with their collaboration, she will continue toward her goals.  For her part, she is committed to paying her loan back in the punctual way she did with her previous loans.  She is very happy to belong to her communal bank, where all of the members are responsible and have solidarity.  \r\n\r\nWith the amount applied for (1000 soles), she will buy more merchandise to continue offering and selling to her customers, who are asking for new designs and a greater variety of sizes.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1021280,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy more garments.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-04-04T04:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-04T04:30:02Z","loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Celfita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":155.55},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":158.65},{"due_date":"2012-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":158.04},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":170.46},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":176.82},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":180.48}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.26},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.92},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.31},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.68}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-04-04T04:57:42Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":406286,"name":"Rosalinda Pelayo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ms. Rosalinda is 47 years old and lives in Caniangan, Tangub City, Misamis Occidental.

In addition, she supports her spouse with expenses.  \r\n\r\nThere is a lot of demand for her business, and even more during peak hours, since there is a shortage of computers and her place is filled with users who are mostly from her area.  For that reason, she would like to grow and increase her business.  \r\n\r\nShe is also in the process of opening a new business - a poultry shop - which she is installing next to the internet stations.  Right now she is awaiting the arrival of the oven and the shop's opening in just two weeks, which will generate more income.  \r\n\r\nThis will be loan number 3 with the institution MPF.  She is grateful to know that she can continue to count on this financial support to develop her business, so she is committed to being responsible with the repayment of her loans, like she was with the previous credit.\r\n\r\nWith the loan which she has applied for 3500 nuevos soles (monetary denomination for Peru),  she will buy computer keyboards, mice, internet cables and other accessories for computers, since she tells us that due to the constant use of the current ones, they are worn out.  She will also invest the balance in the purchase of tables, chairs and utensils for the new poultry shop business.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1020202,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Internet Cafe","sector":"Services","use":"To buy computer mice, keyboards and other accessories for the PC, as well as utensils to launch her poultry shop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-04-04T04:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-04T04:40:02Z","loan_amount":1325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gisela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3500,"loan_amount":1325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":221.99},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":240.68},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":254.76},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":257.4},{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":278.66},{"due_date":"2012-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":283.34},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":295.05},{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":309.52},{"due_date":"2012-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":320.06},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":334.71},{"due_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":347.14},{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":356.69}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.04},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.11},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.45},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.44},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.5},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.26},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.7},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":117.17},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":121.17},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":126.71},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.42},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.03}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-04-08T22:54:42Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":400161,"name":"Edson","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Edson, de 28 a\u00f1os, es un hombre honesto, trabajador y responsable, es soltero y no tiene hijos, vive en casa de sus padres. \u00c9l trabaja mucho pues desea brindar lo mejor a sus padres a quienes apoya en los gastos del hogar.

During this time she was able to obtain products in stock and because of this she already has a secure financial capital. But the most profitable financial activity is centered around raising chicken, which she sells together with her mother to a well-known restaurant in the city. She says that she and her mother are planning on setting up a very large space that she has in her home where they can raise more chicken and in this way supply the orders they have. She is already planning strategies to make this project a reality. She belongs to the solidarity group \"Tambo al progreso\" and this is her fourth loan with MFP. She is very thankful for all the people who make the money possible as it allows many people like her to get ahead. After receiving support, Jakeline will invest the requested money in the purchase of 400 small chicken to begin her project."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1036755,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy 400 small chicken.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-04-04T10:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-04T10:10:03Z","loan_amount":1500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jakeline ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":4000,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":238.56},{"due_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":273.81},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":275.46},{"due_date":"2012-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":303.44},{"due_date":"2012-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":307.73},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":322.06},{"due_date":"2012-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":340.53},{"due_date":"2012-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":352.88},{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":371.73},{"due_date":"2013-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":386.61},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":407.11},{"due_date":"2013-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":420.08}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.46},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.68},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.3},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.79},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.39},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.78},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":127.7},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":132.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":139.39},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":144.98},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":152.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":157.53}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-04-04T21:35:47Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":403105,"name":"Mujeres De Chajabal Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Do\u00f1a Lidia es una se\u00f1ora casada, tiene 32 a\u00f1os de edad, curso los seis a\u00f1os de educaci\u00f3n primaria, tiene 3 hijos los cuales estudian la educaci\u00f3n primaria, se dedica a los oficios domestico y a la confecci\u00f3n de playeras, y brinda atenci\u00f3n a una tienda de consumo diario, inici\u00f3 el negocio de la tienda con la ayuda de su esposo y lleva 8 a\u00f1os de experiencia.

They live together in their own home, located in the village of Yanama Alto, in the district of Palca-Tarma.  \r\n\r\nSince becoming a mother, Maximiliana has been working in agriculture.  Alongside Miguel, she grows peas, potatoes and root vegetables.  She admits that her work is very tiring, which is why they hire workers during harvest time to speed along the work.  She sells all her production in the wholesale market in Tamba.  She also raises animals such as sheep, guinea-pigs, bulls and two cows who provide her with milk with which she makes cheese to sell.  \"Selling cheese alone, I earn 5 to 10 soles a day\", she says.  For this reason, she is thinking about acquiring more cows to improve her cheese production.\r\n\r\nMaxmiliana is a visionary woman.

For 12 years, he has worked as an electrician, a profession he studied at an institution that offered him the opportunity to learn it. Before that he farmed alongside his father. Once he finished the electrician training, a friend offered him work so that he could practice what he had learned. Then he worked for a telecommunications company and other firms. Jos\u00e9's dream is to own his own business; today he works on his own. To buy the materials he needs to do his job, he takes a bus that takes thirty minutes to arrive at his destination. \r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 is requesting this loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo to buy 70 meters of sheet steel, 250 bolts, 3 canopies, a gallon of paint, and the rest to pay for labor.

Another activity that produces benefits for her is raising livestock.  \r\n\r\nShe tills the land with help from her two bullocks and she sells the milk her cows produce and also makes cheese with it. In addition, she opened a grocery and basic staples store at home a year ago.

He transports his harvests to the wholesale market in the city of Tarma. During the months of January, February, and March, potatoes are in great demand in the city of Lima and Nicanor travels there frequently. The same occurs in May and November, when he sells gladiolas.\r\n\r\nNicanor raises cattle as well. Thanks to his milk cows, he also makes cheeses and sells milk. He is content to live in the countryside, despite the cold and the intense rains that make his work difficult. \r\n\r\nThis is his 8th loan through MFP, and Nicanor assures us that the monthly payments will be made punctually. He awaits this help in order to achieve his objectives. Nicanor belongs to \u201cLos Manantiales de [The Fountains of] Yanama\u201d communal bank. He is very satisfied to work with such responsible and supportive people. He will invest the money in purchasing 3 bags of green pea seeds; the remainder will be used to acquire fertilizers.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1037219,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"purchase 3 bags of green pea seeds plus sacks of fertilizers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-04-04T17:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-04T17:10:02Z","loan_amount":750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nicanor ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-04-05T23:56:31Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":403177,"name":"Tacajalve Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Santos Maria es casada, tiene 39 a\u00f1os de edad, no tuvo la oportunidad de estudiar, tiene 5 hijos 2 de los cuales est\u00e1n estudiando, se dedica al comercio a la venta de alimento concentrado para animales, inici\u00f3 este negocio con una tienda y hasta el momento lleva 6 a\u00f1os de experiencia en este negocio, cuenta con el apoyo de su esposo quien se dedica a la venta de ropa.\n\nOrganiza un grupo para poder solicitar un pr\u00e9stamo que lo utilizar\u00e1 para la compra de concentrado para alimento de aves y purina alimento de gatos y perros, ya que en el futuro quiere ver un negocio grande.
