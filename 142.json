This is 53-year-old Edda M. from Mbeya. She is married with three children, between the ages of 14 and 20. Edda has been running a cafe since 1992. A local restaurant or caf\u00e9, also known as a \"Mama Lishe\"  in Tanzania, usually consists of a rough wooden table and some long, wooden benches. The food is all local: rice, ugali (a hot sticky dough, made from maize flour), plantain (a cooked savoury banana), served with beans, vegetables, meat, and a variety of sauces.<P>\r\n\r\n Edda works at the business for 12 hours per day, 6 days per week.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":216232,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","use":"To purchase cloth","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-10-20T17:40:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Asha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-03T19:54:22Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":30000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2008-12-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:06:08Z","rounded_local_amount":31387.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970707,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-01-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:11:43Z","rounded_local_amount":31387.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886924,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-02-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:00:30Z","rounded_local_amount":31387.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436184,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-03-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:53:23Z","rounded_local_amount":31387.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130457,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-04-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:22:09Z","rounded_local_amount":31387.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027259,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-05-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:11:55Z","rounded_local_amount":31387.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613286,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:00:06Z","rounded_local_amount":31387.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010369,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:01Z","rounded_local_amount":31387.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232680,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:50:51Z","rounded_local_amount":31387.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664496,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:44:11Z","rounded_local_amount":31387.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105241,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-10-20T18:54:22Z","paid_date":"2009-10-16T02:44:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":70646,"name":"Juma Alfani's Sea Cliff C Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Juma A., age 26, is married with a 1-year-old child.

from Tanzania! This is 29-year-old Isabela M. from Mbeya. She is married and has three children between the ages of one and five. Isabela owns and operates a small stall from which she sells roasted fish. She buys fresh fish daily from local fishermen as they come in with their morning catch, and then roasts and sells these fish. Fish are plentiful in the waters around the city and is a staple of the local Tanzanian diet.  She is an enterprising micro-entrepreneur who is taking advantage of a local need to make monthly profits of $240. She works at the business for 12 hours a day, 7 days a week. She is requesting a loan of $400 USD to purchase more fish. Isabella thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":216272,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase fish","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-10-21T03:10:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Isabela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-04T06:03:59Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2008-12-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:05:51Z","rounded_local_amount":50220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970713,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-01-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:10:53Z","rounded_local_amount":50220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886930,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-02-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:01:11Z","rounded_local_amount":50220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436190,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:53:22Z","rounded_local_amount":50220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130463,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:22:08Z","rounded_local_amount":50220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027265,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:11:52Z","rounded_local_amount":50220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613290,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:00:01Z","rounded_local_amount":50220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010373,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:09Z","rounded_local_amount":50220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232684,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:51:05Z","rounded_local_amount":50220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664500,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:44:17Z","rounded_local_amount":50219.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105245,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-10-21T05:03:59Z","paid_date":"2009-10-16T02:44:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":70670,"name":"Paula Imelda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Paula Imelda G.

This is 20 year old Negwako M. from Mbeya. She is married with a one-year-old child. Negwako has been running a traditional African cloth business since 2003. Her business is purchasing Traditional African cloth in whole sale and selling them in retail. She works at the business for 12 hours per day, 7 days per week and is assisted by one employee and her sister. Negwako currently earns about $100USD from her business. She is requesting a loan of $350USD in order to purchase additional stock of traditional African cloth. In the future, she plans to open another business. Negwako thanks you for your support!\r\n<p>Negwako has established a store that sells traditional clothing worn by Tanzanian women, called kanga and vitenge. The kanga is a piece of printed cotton fabric often with a border along all four sides. It is printed using the silkscreen method with its pattern in frames. Kitenge (the Swahili plural is vitenge) is a cotton fabric with wax print, printed by using rotary printing machines. Kitenge is a communicating textile - the various colors, patterns, writings and symbols represent moods, feelings, cultures, and traditions of native African people.\r\n<p>SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Lending. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a lending microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microlending is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":216282,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"Negwako would like to purchase additional stock of traditional African cloth to resell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-10-23T18:00:27Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Negwako","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-06T21:36:41Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":400000,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":40000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2008-12-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:07:41Z","rounded_local_amount":40803.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970715,"comment":null},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-01-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:12:37Z","rounded_local_amount":40803.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886932,"comment":null},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-02-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:01:48Z","rounded_local_amount":40803.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436192,"comment":null},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:54:14Z","rounded_local_amount":40803.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130465,"comment":null},{"amount":32.49,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:22:50Z","rounded_local_amount":40803.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027267,"comment":null},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-05-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:12:34Z","rounded_local_amount":40803.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613292,"comment":null},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-06-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:00:40Z","rounded_local_amount":40803.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010375,"comment":null},{"amount":32.51,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:37Z","rounded_local_amount":40803.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232686,"comment":null},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-08-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:51:43Z","rounded_local_amount":40803.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664502,"comment":null},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-09-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:44:34Z","rounded_local_amount":40803.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105247,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-10-23T20:36:41Z","paid_date":"2009-10-16T02:44:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":70678,"name":"Tarcila","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tarcila R.

The kanga is a piece of printed cotton fabric often with a border along all four sides. It is printed using the silkscreen method with its pattern in frames. Kitenge (the Swahili plural is vitenge) is a cotton fabric with wax print, printed by using rotary printing machines. Kitenge is a communicating textile - the various colors, patterns, writings and symbols represent moods, feelings, cultures, and traditions of native African people. \r\n\r\nHappy buys the clothing wholesale and resells it at retail prices.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a lending microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

She is married to Herry Antonio Chac\u00f3n, and they have a 15-year-old son, who is currently in high school. Professor M. is requesting her third loan, which she will use for home improvement. She used her previous loans for paperwork for graduation courses, and for degree processing. She has been an excellent client with good credit history, and is responsible with her payments and with her loans in general. She is a very self-sacrificing person whose work schedule is from 7:30 am to 8:00 pm from Monday through Saturday. On Sundays, she also works from 7:30 am to 2:30 pm, which means that she only spends time with her son in the evenings and on Sunday afternoons. She works hard, however, with an eagerness to assure better income so that she can face their financial situation. She gets support from her husband, who works in construction. Her mother, who is very close to her, takes care of her home and her son. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Elizabeth Casian, Kiva

She finished primary school, but didn't continue studying because of a lack of economic means, and because it was a custom for the parents that only male children had to study.  She got married at age 20 but her and her husband didn't understand each other, which is why they separated, she came to marry Jose Carbajal and has six children, four men and two women, of which only two depend on her.

Then she noticed that the winter season was optimum for selling stuffed potatoes. She could not meet the high demand, so she partnered up with Rossy Paola, and together they now sell stuffed potatoes and other products that sell quickly.\r\nThe business is located on Andr\u00e9s Tello, block 1, lot 7. Her first loan was for 300.00 PEN, which were repaid in 4 monthly installments. She wanted to change her business, so she purchased undergarments to sell, but her sales were unsatisfactory. As a result, she made up for the losses with her next loans. She plans on investing this 800.00 PEN loan, which will be repaid in 6 monthly installments, in the business by purchasing supplies in order to expand. Bertha dreams of having a large hardware store that she can fill with boat construction materials for the fishermen in the area. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Elizabeth Casian, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":216441,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"Expand business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Salaverry - Trujillo - La Libertad","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2008-10-21T07:00:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bertha Flor","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-04T09:56:24Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":133.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":133.33,"processed_date":"2008-12-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T00:41:34Z","rounded_local_amount":140.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9951515,"comment":null},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":133.33,"processed_date":"2009-01-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T13:39:35Z","rounded_local_amount":140.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10224542,"comment":null},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":133.33,"processed_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T19:43:37Z","rounded_local_amount":140.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20417264,"comment":null},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":133.33,"processed_date":"2009-03-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:09:54Z","rounded_local_amount":140.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27110845,"comment":null},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":133.33,"processed_date":"2009-04-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:13:58Z","rounded_local_amount":140.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36006229,"comment":null},{"amount":45.85,"local_amount":133.35,"processed_date":"2009-05-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:39:51Z","rounded_local_amount":140.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44590164,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-10-21T08:56:24Z","paid_date":"2009-06-16T00:39:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":70746,"name":"Marlene","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"<div align='justify'> \r\nEn el municipio de Telica de la ciudad de Le\u00f3n la se\u00f1ora Marlene M. se dedica a laborar con el prop\u00f3sito de mejorar las condiciones de su hogar compuesta por su peque\u00f1o hijo.

Le gusta lo que hace, ya que ella solo controla el tiempo de alquiler de la mesa y cobra por su uso, siendo lo m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil quedarse atendiendo hasta muy tarde y el fr\u00edo que hace por esas horas, qued\u00e1ndose a veces hasta las 8 de la noche. Teodora quiere ofrecerle a su familia mejores oportunidades, como darles una buena educaci\u00f3n, para que sean en un futuro profesionales de \u00e9xito. Con el dinero del pr\u00e9stamo quiere comprar otra mesa y hacer crecer su negocio.  En el futuro quiere expandirse, poniendo un billar, alquilando un local para hacer de este un negocio m\u00e1s estable.","en":"Teodora is 23-years old and lives with her husband, Maximo, and their three children.

They wake up at 4:00 a.m., go to bed at 11:00 p.m. and are very tired when their day ends.

So as to get a footing in economic life, she started several businesses, without success. In the end, she settled for the food-serving business eight years ago. She makes and serves snacks (beignets) and simple dishes (beans, spaghetti, etc). Well known and much appreciated thanks to the quality of her cooking, she has a clientele that is expanding every day. Anxious to maintain her ever-increasing clientele, she decided to join the loan program of Soro Yiriwaso three years ago. She's now seeking her second personal loan after four group loans (solidarity loans) that were repaid without problems.\r\nShe purchases raw materials from wholesale sellers in the grand market in Koutiala and does her cooking in front of her door in the Hamdallaye neighborhood. Beignets, beans and spaghetti are thus prepared and sold in front of the family house. Her clientele comes from all social categories in the city. Her business is open daily and all year long. She usually sells for cash and sometimes on credit. She foresees that she will make a monthly profit of XOF 60'000 (ca US$ 120), to be used to repay the loan and help with the daily family expenses. In the future, her ambition is to open a restaurant.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Patrick Stadelmann, Kiva

She lives in the Los Pinos neighborhood, in the small village of Motil, located in the Agallpampa District, Province of Otuzco, in La Libertad, Per\u00fa.  She completed primary school but could not continue on because her parents passed away and there was no one to support her.  She married William Rojas and has 4 children who are still students.  \r\n\r\nHer business consists of buying guinea pigs, pigs, rabbits, and ducks, that she later sells alive or as meat.  As this is not something she does every day, she has expanded her business by selling snacks and sodas on the side.  All of her business activities are conducted from her home.  \r\n\r\nHer first loan was for 300 soles, repaid in 4 installments.  With this amount, she started her business.

I am 25 years old and married to Mr. Santos Lagos, with whom I have a 3-year-old daughter. My husband works and together we pay the bills. For three years I have made a living selling food. I sold clothes previously, but since I've been married my mother-in-law has helped me start my own business. I have many good customers and I also sell bottled water. I'm located in the Mongollano neighborhood near the SULA Milk building, and almost all of the employees come to business to buy lunch and other snacks. I also allow some of the workers to pay me on credit, and at the end of the month they pay me for all they have taken. Currently I am in very high demand and I need to buy more supplies to meet my customers' demands. Due to the current high costs of my supplies, it's impossible for me to meet these demands on my own, so I'm requesting a loan to be able to keep making headway with my business.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":216813,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase meats, pastas, oil, lard, bread, vegetables, sauces, salt, sugar, bottle water, tortillas, cheese, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"San Lorenzo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.416667 -87.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":118,"posted_date":"2008-11-01T05:00:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vicky","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-15T12:47:35Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":5000,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":833.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2008-12-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T02:44:08Z","rounded_local_amount":866.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9967690,"comment":null},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2009-01-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:58:39Z","rounded_local_amount":866.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14884131,"comment":null},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2009-02-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:50:47Z","rounded_local_amount":866.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20433579,"comment":null},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2009-03-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:39:16Z","rounded_local_amount":866.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27127912,"comment":null},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:05:28Z","rounded_local_amount":866.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36024713,"comment":null},{"amount":45.85,"local_amount":833.35,"processed_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:56:06Z","rounded_local_amount":866.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44610624,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-11-01T11:47:35Z","paid_date":"2009-06-16T01:56:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":70931,"name":"Maria Del Socorro","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"<div align='justify'> \r\nEn el municipio de Ciudad Sandino de la ciudad de Managua, la se\u00f1ora Mar\u00eda del Socorro G. se dedica con grandes esfuerzos a laborar en su negocio de pulper\u00eda el cual muy amablemente lo atiende en sus casa de habitaci\u00f3n.\r\n<p>\r\nLa se\u00f1ora Maria tiene la obligaci\u00f3n de mantener a su anciana madre y por este motivo ha buscado la manera de mejorar su negocio y para esto ha hecho uso de los cr\u00e9ditos brindados por Ceprodel el cual le han sido de gran bendici\u00f3n para su negocio.

However, her father was very macho and would not allow it.

She has to work very hard for her son because she actually acts as both father and mother to him, since she has separated from her husband. \r\n\r\nShe is a proactive woman, a fighter and does not allow herself to wane. She has a shop in partnership with her brother's wife and also creates a daily menu at her home. Her shop is located on Manuel Arevalo 108 D.

construction worker. They have no children. Mork owns a small plot of land upon which she cultivates rice for a living, but the land has become infertile. To solve this problem, she is requesting a loan to purchase more fertilizers in order to produce a good crop. <p>\r\n\r\nBecause Mrs. Sun S., one of the group members, was not available for the picture, her husband is shown instead. <p>\r\n\r\nThis is a group loan consisting of end-of-term loans with the exception of one group member who has a monthly payment loan. Such members are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK'\u0080\u0099s main product because they are the most beneficial to Cambodia's poor, allowing them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK'\u0080\u0099s clients make their payments on time. AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09% and a default rate of 0% on Kiva.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":216966,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase more fertilizers to support her field.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":109,"posted_date":"2008-10-23T14:50:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mork","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sun","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Khy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kun","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Morm","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-07T00:44:36Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":1150000,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":104545.45},{"due_date":"2009-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":104545.45},{"due_date":"2009-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":104545.45},{"due_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":104545.45},{"due_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":104545.45},{"due_date":"2009-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":104545.45},{"due_date":"2009-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":104545.45},{"due_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":104545.45},{"due_date":"2009-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":104545.45},{"due_date":"2009-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":104545.45},{"due_date":"2009-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":104545.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.27},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.27},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.27},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.27},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.27},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.27},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.27},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.27},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.27},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.27},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":23.74,"local_amount":91000,"processed_date":"2008-11-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-15T20:17:42Z","rounded_local_amount":96974.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5286357,"comment":null},{"amount":64.04,"local_amount":245500,"processed_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T12:16:21Z","rounded_local_amount":261617.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9899343,"comment":null},{"amount":11.87,"local_amount":45500,"processed_date":"2008-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T12:16:22Z","rounded_local_amount":48487.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9899344,"comment":null},{"amount":37.96,"local_amount":145500,"processed_date":"2009-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T09:54:56Z","rounded_local_amount":155052.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14823493,"comment":null},{"amount":71.08,"local_amount":272500,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T10:58:21Z","rounded_local_amount":290390.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35940651,"comment":null},{"amount":15.65,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-29T07:38:05Z","rounded_local_amount":63939.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52906057,"comment":null},{"amount":75.66,"local_amount":290000,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-16T17:01:04Z","rounded_local_amount":309039.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63128134,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-10-23T23:44:36Z","paid_date":"2009-08-16T17:01:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":70990,"name":"Christine Nalubega's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Christine is the leader of a group of 5 members.

Usaha ini sangat membantu dalam memenuhi kebutuhan rumah tangganya. Karena bila hanya mengandalkan suami dalam memenuhi kebutuhan rumah tangganya dirasakan sangat susah. Namun belakangan ini harga pakan sangat tinggi. Untuk mengatsi hal itu, Ni Wayan Sutarmi bergabung dengan program dari Dinari yakni program Ternak Babi yang jangka waktunya selama 6 bulan dan pengembalian pinjaman pada akhir periode. Ni Wayan Sutarmi memiliki 1 orang anak yang masih duduk dibangku SD. Semangat untuk berusaha yang dimiliki membuat suaminya sangat senang karena sangat meringankan beban sebagai kepala rumah tangga. Karena penghasilan suami sebagai petani yang tidak menentu. Keuntungan yang sudah dirasakan sangat memuaskan.dalam 6 bulan 5 bibit babi ini bisa menghasilkan Rp. 2.000.000-. Keuntungan ini digunakan untuk biaya keluarganya dan ditabung untuk keperluan pendidikan anaknya.","en":"Every 8 am Ni Wayan Sutarmi feeds the 5 pigs she is raising.  This has become her daily routine after completing cooking in the kitchen.  The pigs being raised are housed in the bamboo stall behind her home.  This effort greatly assists in covering the family\u2019s expenses.  Because only depending on her husband\u2019s to cover the family\u2019s expenses is hardship.
