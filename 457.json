It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Theresia has encountered difficulties in life ranging from the inability to meet her daily needs and the failure to attain a quality education. She reiterates, however, how happy she was when she gave birth to a set of twins. \n\nWith this loan, Theresia plans to clear off weeds from her farm and to buy fertilizer to apply to the soil for a higher yield. She is convinced that the soil does not deceive anyone who works hard. She will also use part of the capital to buy vegetables seeds which she will plant, nurture, harvest and sell while she feeds her family on the surplus. The loan will help her community because she will be able to provide vegetables which are very good for health, and they will not incur transport costs to buy it elsewhere in distant places. \n\nTheresia will plough back her profit into her business and use part to care for her family. She will use a portion of the profit to pay for her children\u2019s education and upgrade their standard of living. \n\nTheresia prefers borrowing from GHAPE because of the training she frequently receives and the follow-up. GHAPE also does not ask for collateral securities, and its loans are low cost with a gradual repayment rate.\n\nAbout GHAPE:\n\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon. GHAPE works towards empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach. Every client is trained in business and financial management, basic health maintenance, life skills and family values.

GHAPE instills a sense of family and community among its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":595973,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To enrich her farm and buy vegetable seeds","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Alabukam, Mankon, NW.

She is married to Che John and they are blessed with six children. She shares five rooms with her six children and her husband. She lives in Ntamuche Nkwen, a quarter in Bamenda North West Region of Cameroon.\r\n\r\nChe I. has encountered difficulties in life ranging from the inability to meet her daily needs, and failure to attain a quality education. With this loan, she plans to use part to clear off unwanted weeds from her farm, buy piglets, and buy fertilizer to apply to the soil for a higher yield. She is convinced that the soil does not deceive anyone who works hard. She will use part of the capital to buy vegetable seeds which she will plant, nurture and harvest. She will sell the excess, while her family uses the surplus. The loan will help her community, because she will be able to provide vegetables which are very good for their health. They will not need to incur transport costs to buy it elsewhere in distant places. She will be able to take care of her children\u2019s education. She will plough back her profit into her business and use part to care for her family. She will use a fraction of the profit to pay for her children's education and upgrade her standard of living. \r\n\r\nShe prefers GHAPE because of the training she frequently receives, the follow up, that GHAPE does not ask for collateral securities, and the low cost of obtaining and paying back a loan. And that the payment is gradual.\r\n\r\nAbout GHAPE:\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon. GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.

She belongs to Omungyenyi Tukwatanise group, Ntungamo. With this as her only source of livelihood, she has painstakingly managed to make ends meet, albeit with some long drawn out seasonal income fluctuations and poor road systems to access bigger markets.\r\n\r\nWith a hard work ethic, the 50 year old widowed mother of 6 children has kept her business on a consolidated growth path.

the D.E.C Baptist Model School, Mabanta village, Makeni. D.E.C Baptist Model School was founded in September, 1984. This school came about as a result of the community\u2019s dire need and the Baptist mission\u2019s desire to propagate the Gospel of Christ to the children of the community, especially to the girls. \r\n\r\nSchool staff from this institution, like many other schools' staff within SMT\u2019s operational area, come to SMT to apply for loans. With the help of these loans, they can accomplish certain tasks that they would otherwise not be able to accomplish with their salaries alone. With the help of this loan, some can pay school fees for their children; others can use the loan to buy pieces of furniture, a plot of land, house-building materials, or invest in business. At the end of each month, these teachers repay the loan out of their monthly salaries. The institution\u2019s bursar is responsible for deducting the repayments and pays SMT on their behalf.\r\n\r\nDavid E. T. (on the left in the photo) is the leader of this group and headmaster at the school. David is 54 years old and was born in Makama village. He has been in the teaching profession for 29 years now. He is married to a businesswoman and the couple has seven children:  two in primary school, three in secondary school, one in college and another who is now an adult. Mr. T. will be using his share of the loan to pay school and college fees for his children. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":596041,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","use":"To pay school and college fees for his children","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Makeni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.883333 -12.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2010-09-08T00:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"David Edison","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Foday","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Abdul R.","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mr. Abu Bakarr","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":4000000,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2010-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2011-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2011-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2011-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2011-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":400000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":205,"local_amount":800000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:39:00Z","rounded_local_amount":809749.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172174799,"comment":null},{"amount":102.5,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:05:54Z","rounded_local_amount":404875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177470943,"comment":null},{"amount":102.5,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:38:15Z","rounded_local_amount":404874.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188747761,"comment":null},{"amount":102.5,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T05:32:16Z","rounded_local_amount":404875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191485974,"comment":null},{"amount":102.5,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-20T08:13:41Z","rounded_local_amount":404875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201952884,"comment":null},{"amount":102.5,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-18T07:58:41Z","rounded_local_amount":404875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206572286,"comment":null},{"amount":205,"local_amount":800000,"processed_date":"2011-05-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:57:27Z","rounded_local_amount":809749.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211296992,"comment":null},{"amount":102.5,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2011-06-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-20T08:01:16Z","rounded_local_amount":404875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":217134351,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-09-08T06:59:27Z","paid_date":"2011-07-20T08:01:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":229128,"name":"Jaime","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Jaime vive en casa de sus padres en la zona de Tembladerani de la ciudad de La Paz, quedo viudo hace un a\u00f1o y no tiene hijos, es carpintero y trabaja en una carpinter\u00eda donde percibe un sueldo m\u00ednimo.

She works a lot, and this will allow her to better manage housework.\r\n\r\nF\u00e1tima has built her house bit by bit; it's a small house built with cement blocks and wood. With this financing, she will build a bathroom. Her house doesn't currently have a bathroom and in the winter the public bathrooms are very full. Thus, F\u00e1tima will buy construction materials such as concrete blocks, sand, cement, and iron rods to finish the bathroom and purchase a toilet. She would be happy to achieve her goal of better hygiene.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Vivian Lu, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":596044,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction Supplies","sector":"Construction","use":"Purchase of stone, sand, cement, and iron rods for construction of the bathroom and plumbing, and purchase of toilet for improved hygiene.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2010-09-08T14:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatima Petrona","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":6000,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-11-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":106.55,"local_amount":2131.09,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T12:02:37Z","rounded_local_amount":2294.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177330937,"comment":null},{"amount":47.06,"local_amount":941.19,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-19T09:09:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1013.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189098220,"comment":null},{"amount":50.55,"local_amount":1011.03,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T00:47:14Z","rounded_local_amount":1088.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191348789,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":999.99,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:06:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1076.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195766472,"comment":null},{"amount":45.84,"local_amount":916.7,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T09:57:57Z","rounded_local_amount":987.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201209513,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-09-08T17:14:56Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T09:57:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":229130,"name":"Yolanda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Yolanda, de 41 a\u00f1os, es una mujer emprendedora, vive junto a su esposo y sus 3 hijos en su casa heredada en el cono sur de Lima.

Z. lives in Kok-Tokoy village in the northern region of Kyrgyzstan.  She is 42 years old, married, and has three children. After graduating from medical college in the capital city, she worked in the local hospital.  Her open-hearted personality and attentive attitude to patients helped her to acquire an excellent reputation as a medic.  As salaries in rural areas are low,  people need to find an additional means to lift themselves from the poverty level. For this reason, Kuljamal and her family started their own business in cattle breeding. At present, the farm has 13 sheep and one milch cow.  Kuljamal is also engaged in cultivating apples, pears, raspberries, and currants, all of which were planted 15 years ago.  Today her family works hard to get a good harvest.  These activities allowed Kuljamal to improve her household, but she still needs a loan of 60,000 KGS to buy 10 sheep and one colt.

As a result, he was better able to engage in business activities and to thereby improve his family's standard of living. Purisimo has successfully repaid a previous loan in the amount of 13,000 PHP from HSPFI. This prior loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Purisimo is now requesting a new loan, this time in the amount of 16,000 PHP ($375), which will be used to purchase additional inventory and for working capital purposes. Notably, this loan would be the fifth loan taken out by Purisimo from HSPFI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business on account of this loan to improve and expand his business. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI: HSPFI is an accredited partner of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

Komiljon is 35 years old. He has a successful business selling flour at the local market of Penjikent town. Komiljon sells an assortment of good quality and different sorts. Because he buys his goods at wholesale, the price of them is cheaper than the price of his competitors. Thus he has many customers who even make a purchase of his products straight from his house.\r\n\r\nToday he has a great demand for his goods and that is why he wants to take an individual loan. Komiljon has requested a loan of 7,000 Somoni to add to his working capital and allow him to purchase more inventory. He is ready to work even harder, make sacrifices and push every once in awhile to achieve his goal and become a successful entrepreneur. We believe his perseverance and clear vision will become key factors in the success of his small business.    \r\n \r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n \r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n \r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Tohirboy has worked for many years in the difficult business of raising cattle. He is an exemplary husband in that he always tries his hardest to provide food for his wife and two children in their home. After purchasing his cattle, Iskandar provides them with all the right conditions for their growth: taking care of their food and protection and making sure they don\u2019t get lost. Once they\u2019re fully mature, Iskandar sells them in his area and also provides their milk for sale. \r\n\r\nCurrently he needs to purchase cattle to raise and for this reason is turning to IMON International to obtain a loan of $1,000. Iskandar thanks KIVA for the support that KIVA presents to small entrepreneurs.   \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need. \r\n\r\nTo learn more about IMON International's work, please visit:

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.\r\n\r\nTo learn more about IMON International's work, please visit: www.imon.tj\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3000,"image":{"id":596313,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchasing seed, fertilizer, fuels and lubricants, cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Shahrituz","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":100,"posted_date":"2010-09-08T12:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Umedjon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":3000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":976.82},{"due_date":"2011-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":996.18},{"due_date":"2011-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1027}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":976.82},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":996.18},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1027}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":0.3,"local_amount":0.3,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-17T10:43:04Z","rounded_local_amount":0.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177695983,"comment":null},{"amount":1.11,"local_amount":1.11,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-19T07:52:29Z","rounded_local_amount":1.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206666245,"comment":null},{"amount":2107.55,"local_amount":2107.55,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-16T08:10:25Z","rounded_local_amount":2107.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211444721,"comment":null},{"amount":891.04,"local_amount":891.04,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-17T07:50:22Z","rounded_local_amount":891.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221989828,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-09-15T23:02:30Z","paid_date":"2011-08-17T07:50:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":229247,"name":"Sophia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sophia S. is from Baranggay 5, Tangub City.

he was a young man, Kamol has known hard work. His parents taught him how to get by as an farmer and he learned very well. Now that he is the father of a family he still works as an farmer. Thanks to his parents Kamol now has the opportunity to move forward as a farmer and  hopes to increase his agricultural products so that he can provide his loved ones a more promising life. Despite being a good agriculturalist and worker he needs help to move forward and improve his production. This is why he is asking for a loan, so that he can buy more of the seeds and fertilizers he needs, which are very expensive. Without them his production will not improve. You can help Kamol keep moving forward with his development plans.    \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

This will enable him to increase his working capital but also honour his commitments to Soro Yiriwaso and cover other family expenses.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ren\u00e9 McConnell, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":596496,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To buy clothing (shirts, slacks, T-shirts, shoes, etc.)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Malik ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2011-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166.66},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.66},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:52Z","rounded_local_amount":85393.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177476837,"comment":null},{"amount":166.66,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:43:16Z","rounded_local_amount":85393.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188751978,"comment":null},{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2011-02-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:20:00Z","rounded_local_amount":85393.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195917903,"comment":null},{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2011-04-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:48:26Z","rounded_local_amount":85393.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206226174,"comment":null},{"amount":166.66,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2011-06-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:51:58Z","rounded_local_amount":85393.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216580709,"comment":null},{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2011-08-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T10:19:39Z","rounded_local_amount":85393.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227120005,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-10-08T08:40:14Z","paid_date":"2011-09-15T10:19:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":229355,"name":"Jiguis\u00e8m\u00e8 Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Les quatre femmes du groupe Jiguis\u00e8m\u00e8 (sont toutes mari\u00e9es) avec une moyenne d\u2019\u00e2ge de 33 ans, 4 enfants, vivent dans des  familles monogames \u00e0 Ouayerma II un des quartiers de la ville de Sikasso (3\u00e8me r\u00e9gion administrative du Mali). \nElles collaborent avec l\u2019institution de microfinance Soro Yiriwaso afin de satisfaire le besoin de leur client\u00e8le et sont \u00e0 leur cinqui\u00e8me  pr\u00eat, tous les pass\u00e9s se sont bien d\u00e9nou\u00e9s. \nElles m\u00e8nent diverses  activit\u00e9s  qui sont entre autres la vente de friperie, de fruits et l\u00e9gumes et de tasses  avec AWA K..\nAvec son pr\u00eat, elle compte acheter, 4 douzaines de tasses.

This first loan will allow him to purchase from farmers in the Sikasso region 10 bags of potatoes, 10 bags of oranges, 15 bags of lemons, 20 bags of sweet potatoes etc. He sells wholesale and retail to customers from all social layers, but most of all to restaurant owners.\r\n\r\nWith this first loan, he plans to achieve a monthly income of 100,000 West African Francs, which will be used to cover his essential needs as well as the needs of his family, with the rest reinvested in the business.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ekaterina Sukhanova, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":596505,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"Purchasing fruits and vegetables (potatoes, oranges, lemons, sweet potatoes, etc).","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mohamedi ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":200000,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2011-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":133.33,"local_amount":66666.66,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:38Z","rounded_local_amount":68314.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177476842,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:40:08Z","rounded_local_amount":34157.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182613554,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:43:07Z","rounded_local_amount":34157.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188751983,"comment":null},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2011-01-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-17T00:57:15Z","rounded_local_amount":34157.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191606237,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":33333.35,"processed_date":"2011-02-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:20:20Z","rounded_local_amount":34157.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195917908,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-10-03T05:30:33Z","paid_date":"2011-03-15T12:20:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":229361,"name":"Atamu Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Pictured here are members of the <i>Atamu<\/i> Group.

Batoma sells dried and smoked fish and often some food condiments such as onions at the Ch\u00e2teau market in S\u00e9gou. She enjoys a great reputation in her sales area and even in her district. She frequently gets orders from Bamako and Kayes where she has clients. Her fish are carefully protected from flies and mosquitos.  In the hope of increasing her working capital and satisfy her ever more demanding clientele, she turned to the Soro Yiriwaso microfinance institution.  This is her first loan, which she plans to use to buy 200 kilos of dried fish and 150 kilos of smoked fish. She gets her stock on site in S\u00e9gou from fishermen's cooperatives.  Mrs. Singar\u00e9 accepts cash and credit and sells to a clientele composed of women and men.

She is especially sought after when there are major social events (weddings, christenings and funerals). \r\n\r\nIn order to keep her increasingly numerous customer base happy, she is seeking the help of Soro Yiriwaso, which which she has been working for 30 months. She has paid back all loans obtained (3 group loans and 1 individual one). This is her second individual loan, which she will use to buy two truckloads of firewood. She stocks up in Sanando, on the Bamako road. Haoua Traore sells for cash or credit to a mostly female customer base. With this loan she hopes to make a monthly profit of 100000FCFA, which will allow her to finish her house and meet the needs of her family (clothing and food).<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alba Sort , Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":596516,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Charcoal Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"Buy firewood","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Segou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14 -6","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Haoua ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":200000,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":18181.82},{"due_date":"2010-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":18181.82},{"due_date":"2010-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":18181.82},{"due_date":"2011-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":18181.82},{"due_date":"2011-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":18181.82},{"due_date":"2011-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":18181.82},{"due_date":"2011-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":18181.82},{"due_date":"2011-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":18181.82},{"due_date":"2011-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":18181.82},{"due_date":"2011-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":18181.82},{"due_date":"2011-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":18181.8}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.36},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.37},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.36},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.36},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.37},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.36},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.37},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.36},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.36},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.37},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.36}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":36.36,"local_amount":18181.82,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:17Z","rounded_local_amount":18631.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177476846,"comment":null},{"amount":36.37,"local_amount":18181.82,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:40:40Z","rounded_local_amount":18631.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182613558,"comment":null},{"amount":36.36,"local_amount":18181.82,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:42:49Z","rounded_local_amount":18631.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188751987,"comment":null},{"amount":36.36,"local_amount":18181.82,"processed_date":"2011-01-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-17T00:57:02Z","rounded_local_amount":18631.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191606239,"comment":null},{"amount":36.37,"local_amount":18181.82,"processed_date":"2011-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:20:03Z","rounded_local_amount":18631.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195917910,"comment":null},{"amount":36.36,"local_amount":18181.82,"processed_date":"2011-03-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T12:12:38Z","rounded_local_amount":18631.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201360845,"comment":null},{"amount":36.37,"local_amount":18181.82,"processed_date":"2011-04-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:48:27Z","rounded_local_amount":18631.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206226176,"comment":null},{"amount":36.36,"local_amount":18181.82,"processed_date":"2011-05-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T12:00:06Z","rounded_local_amount":18631.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211301081,"comment":null},{"amount":36.36,"local_amount":18181.82,"processed_date":"2011-06-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:52:00Z","rounded_local_amount":18631.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216580711,"comment":null},{"amount":36.37,"local_amount":18181.82,"processed_date":"2011-07-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:30:17Z","rounded_local_amount":18631.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221750618,"comment":null},{"amount":36.36,"local_amount":18181.8,"processed_date":"2011-08-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T10:19:40Z","rounded_local_amount":18631.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227120007,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-10-03T03:49:56Z","paid_date":"2011-09-15T10:19:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":229367,"name":"God Is Great Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"These are members of the \u201cGod Is Great\u201d Group.

This will enable her to manage her daily life.\r\n\r\nHer goal is to expand her workshop and train numerous employees.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Nathalie Pelletier, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":596518,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"Buy a Corna sewing machine","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Segou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14 -6","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Amidatou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":400000,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":36363.64},{"due_date":"2010-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":36363.64},{"due_date":"2010-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":36363.64},{"due_date":"2011-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":36363.64},{"due_date":"2011-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":36363.64},{"due_date":"2011-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":36363.64},{"due_date":"2011-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":36363.64},{"due_date":"2011-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":36363.64},{"due_date":"2011-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":36363.64},{"due_date":"2011-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":36363.64},{"due_date":"2011-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":36363.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.73},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.72},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.73},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.73},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.73},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.72},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.73},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.73},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.73},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.72},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.73}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":72.73,"local_amount":36363.64,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:26Z","rounded_local_amount":37262.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177476847,"comment":null},{"amount":72.72,"local_amount":36363.64,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:39:58Z","rounded_local_amount":37262.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182613559,"comment":null},{"amount":72.73,"local_amount":36363.64,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:42:56Z","rounded_local_amount":37262.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188751988,"comment":null},{"amount":72.73,"local_amount":36363.64,"processed_date":"2011-01-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-17T00:57:12Z","rounded_local_amount":37262.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191606240,"comment":null},{"amount":72.73,"local_amount":36363.64,"processed_date":"2011-02-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:20:16Z","rounded_local_amount":37262.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195917911,"comment":null},{"amount":72.72,"local_amount":36363.64,"processed_date":"2011-03-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T12:12:52Z","rounded_local_amount":37262.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201360846,"comment":null},{"amount":72.73,"local_amount":36363.64,"processed_date":"2011-04-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:48:38Z","rounded_local_amount":37262.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206226177,"comment":null},{"amount":72.73,"local_amount":36363.64,"processed_date":"2011-05-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T12:00:22Z","rounded_local_amount":37262.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211301082,"comment":null},{"amount":72.73,"local_amount":36363.64,"processed_date":"2011-06-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:52:10Z","rounded_local_amount":37262.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216580712,"comment":null},{"amount":72.72,"local_amount":36363.64,"processed_date":"2011-07-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:30:24Z","rounded_local_amount":37262.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221750619,"comment":null},{"amount":72.73,"local_amount":36363.6,"processed_date":"2011-08-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T10:19:47Z","rounded_local_amount":37262.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227120008,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-10-01T09:41:18Z","paid_date":"2011-09-15T10:19:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":229369,"name":"Isaac","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Isaac is 32 years old and married with two children, ages 1 year and 6 months.

She lives with her husband in a traditional extended family in the Darsalam district in Segou (the 4th administrative district of Mali).\r\n\r\nFatoumata has left school after the 8th grade (Mali\u2019s educational system) in order to join her mother in the business of selling clothing and kitchen utensils. After several years of apprenticeship, once she got married, she  launched her own business in the same line as her mother.\r\n\r\nShe has been in business for 26 years and is well-known and respected. Her strength is in high quality of her products.\r\n\r\nIn order to bolster her business capital and increase her income, she has turned to Soroo Yiriwaso. She has been collaborating with Soro Yiriwaso for five years and had 8 solidarity loans and two individual loans, all properly repaid.\r\n\r\nShe is now on her 3rd individual loan which she plans to sue to purchase 1 bale of wax \u201cpagnes\u201d [traditional colorful fabric] and 50 plastic and aluminum bathtubs. She stocks up in Burkina Faso. Mrs. Fatoumata C. sells for cash and on credit to a customer base composed of both women and men.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, she anticipates achieving a monthly benefit of 30,000 West African francs. This income will allow her to take part in community events. Her goal is to build a house to live in. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ekaterina Sukhanova, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":596520,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchasing clothing and kitchen utensils","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Segou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14 -6","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatoumata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":400000,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":36363.64},{"due_date":"2010-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":36363.64},{"due_date":"2010-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":36363.64},{"due_date":"2011-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":36363.64},{"due_date":"2011-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":36363.64},{"due_date":"2011-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":36363.64},{"due_date":"2011-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":36363.64},{"due_date":"2011-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":36363.64},{"due_date":"2011-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":36363.64},{"due_date":"2011-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":36363.64},{"due_date":"2011-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":36363.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.73},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.72},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.73},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.73},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.73},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.72},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.73},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.73},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.73},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.72},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.73}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":72.73,"local_amount":36363.64,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:35Z","rounded_local_amount":37262.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177476848,"comment":null},{"amount":72.72,"local_amount":36363.64,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:40:05Z","rounded_local_amount":37262.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182613560,"comment":null},{"amount":72.73,"local_amount":36363.64,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:43:04Z","rounded_local_amount":37262.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188751989,"comment":null},{"amount":72.73,"local_amount":36363.64,"processed_date":"2011-01-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-17T00:57:12Z","rounded_local_amount":37262.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191606241,"comment":null},{"amount":72.73,"local_amount":36363.64,"processed_date":"2011-02-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:20:16Z","rounded_local_amount":37262.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195917912,"comment":null},{"amount":72.72,"local_amount":36363.64,"processed_date":"2011-03-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T12:12:53Z","rounded_local_amount":37262.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201360847,"comment":null},{"amount":72.73,"local_amount":36363.64,"processed_date":"2011-04-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:48:40Z","rounded_local_amount":37262.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206226178,"comment":null},{"amount":72.73,"local_amount":36363.64,"processed_date":"2011-05-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T12:00:22Z","rounded_local_amount":37262.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211301083,"comment":null},{"amount":72.73,"local_amount":36363.64,"processed_date":"2011-06-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:52:11Z","rounded_local_amount":37262.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216580713,"comment":null},{"amount":72.72,"local_amount":36363.64,"processed_date":"2011-07-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:30:26Z","rounded_local_amount":37262.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221750620,"comment":null},{"amount":72.73,"local_amount":36363.6,"processed_date":"2011-08-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T10:19:48Z","rounded_local_amount":37262.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227120009,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-10-04T03:04:51Z","paid_date":"2011-09-15T10:19:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":229371,"name":"Tabaksneh Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"These are microentrepreneurs from Makeni, a city in Northern Sierra Leone.

was born in 1966. She is married to Sama Aron, and they are blessed with five children. She shares five rooms with her five children and her husband in Musang, a quarter in Bamenda, in the North-West Region of Cameroon.\r\n\r\nE. has had great difficulties in life, ranging from ill-health, failure to attain quality education, and inadequate capital to expand her business. Amongst other challenges, she needs more capital to be able to pull ahead with her projects. With this loan, she plans to buy yams seeds, day-old chicks, and piglets, which she will keep and will later on sell to make more profit from them. She thinks her business is an influential one, and she has succeeded over the past years. She, as well, regularly undertakes contracts. The loan will help her community because they will be able to afford good yams, chickens, and pigs for affordable prices.\r\n\r\nShe will plough her profit back into her business and use part to care for her family. She will use a fraction of the profit to pay for her children's education and upgrade her standard of living. She  prefers GHAPE because of the training she frequently receives, the follow-up, and the low cost of obtaining and paying back a loan.\r\n\r\nAbout GHAPE:\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon. GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multifaceted approach. Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values. Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement. GHAPE instills a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":580,"image":{"id":596542,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase yams seeds, poultry and pig farming","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Musang, Bamenda, NW.

U. is 58 years old and the mother of five children.

Today, she earns 2,200 KGS per month by selling milk to a local diary.  She also earns a small amount of money by farming a plot of land on which she grows kidney beans and potatoes. And, because she is a very energetic woman, she supplements these two sources of income by sewing garments for brides, and is well known locally for her skills in this area. \r\n \r\nAidake has applied for a loan for 60,000 KGS to to buy more milk cows, which will allow her to increase sales and acquire more customers. She plans to use her increased income to build a barn for her cows. In the future, she dreams of buying a sewing machine so she can expand her clothing-making business. \r\n \r\nBai-Tushum and Partners uses Kiva funding to target especially vulnerable populations.

He is a small businessman who makes a living in the town of Ivano-Frankivsk by selling clothing in the central market. He specializes in underwear, caps, socks, pantyhose, and other items. He went into business 11 years ago after resigning from a low-paying job at a local factory. His business has benefited from microloans since he started it, and today his monthly profit comes to 6,000 Grivnyas.   \r\n\r\nAndryi is seeking a 7,500 Grivnya loan to buy additional items to sell to his customers.

She has been a farmer for 27 years and considers the most difficult part of it transporting the products to Tarma because the sacks are very heavy and they tire her out a lot.\r\n\r\nIn time she\u2019d like to install a grocery store to improve her economy.\r\n\r\nThis is her 8th loan with MFP and she is happy to be able to access it.  She wants to thank all the people that will fund it making it possible for her to get the money she needs.\r\n\r\nShe is respected in her communal bank because she imposes order at the meetings.\r\n\r\nShe will use the requested 2000 new soles to buy new pea seed and sacks of manure.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":596571,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":" To buy sacks of manure and pea seeds.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-09-07T19:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":725,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:33:33Z","rounded_local_amount":2027.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216549374,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-09-08T01:09:06Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T11:33:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":229391,"name":"Marcial  Juan","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Sr. Marcial se dedica a la elaboraci\u00f3n de salte\u00f1as y otros en su domicilio con la ayuda de su esposa quien las vende en la avenida principal de la zona, la actividad que realiza la pareja les ayuda a sustentar a su familia ya que es el \u00fanico ingreso que tienen para los gastos de la alimentaci\u00f3n y pagar los estudios de los hijos que est\u00e1n en colegio, podemos indicar tambi\u00e9n que los clientes son bastantes trabajadores y responsables ya que se esfuerzan para cancelar sus obligaciones, por lo que se vio por conveniente darles la tasa kiva, con el dinero del cr\u00e9dito compraran harina, aj\u00ed picante, papa por cantidad para la elaboraci\u00f3n de las riqu\u00edsimas salte\u00f1as que elabora el Sr. Marcial.\t","en":"Marcial makes salte\u00f1as (savory baked turnovers) from his home, helping his wife who also makes and sells them along the main road of the region.

Time has taught Artemio that one has to work very hard if the harvest is going to be the best in the village so it is with a great deal of effort that he has cared for his potato, sweet pea, spinach, and carrot plantations. His products are very sought out in the markets of the city of Tarma. What he most enjoys about the work is the harvest. For the past 45 years he has worked in the business and it has always been very difficult to ward his fields from insects and pests.

She is a very happy and hard working woman. She lives together with her husband and their youngest son Bryan, 13 years old. They are the reason for all of her efforts. She harvests carrots and gladiola flowers. This is Delia's daily work. With a great deal of effort she has managed to make her fields to be very productive, generating excellent quality harvests and very sought out by the wholesale market in the city of Tarma. Her favorite part of her work is caring of the plantations. She has had 15 years in the field. The most difficult part of the work is having to transport her products all the way to the city of Tarma. The sacks are very heavy. IN the future she hopes to have a stand in the wholesale market to improve her earnings. This is her seventh loan with MFP (Kiva Field Partner) and she will endeavor to be on time with her payments, not wanting to cause any troubles with her community bank, where she feels very content.

He is a very unpretentious and hard working young man. He lives in a rented house together with his wife Lisbeth, 21 years old, and their only son, Junior who is 10 months old. They are the reason for all of his efforts. In the comfort of his home Harold has an oven. He starts baking very early in the morning to fill all the orders he has received from his clients. He works together with his wife Lisbeth and together they bake breads. The oven belongs to them both. He very much enjoys his work, especially baking cakes. He has 15 years' experience in the field. The most difficult part of the work is baking breads because he always has to give special care to not over bake them. In the future he hopes to set up a store from where they can sell their baked goods themselves. This is the first loan through MFP (Kiva Field Partner). He knows that if he pays his loan back on time he will have access to future loans and not bring any difficulties to his community bank. He is very well liked by the other members of the group. The one thousand nuevos soles that he requests will be invested in the purchase of ingredients to bake more delicious breads. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Erika Lindig, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":596588,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase ingredients for his bakery.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-09-07T17:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Harold ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:32:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1048.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216549377,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-09-07T18:49:33Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T11:32:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":229401,"name":"Salustino","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Salustino vive en casa propia en la zona de Las Lomas, de la ciudad de La Paz, es soltero, es polic\u00eda y adem\u00e1s realiza trabajos varios como electricista, con los ingresos que obtiene se mantiene y ayuda a su familia.

She lives with her son, Maycon, in the house that she inherited from her mother.  What she wishes for most is to improve her quality of life.\r\n\r\nThe products that Maximiliana has managed to cultivate, with much effort and dedication, have helped her a lot to make progress in her life.  Every morning she starts to work in her fields.  She knows that the quality of the products that she will get depends upon the care she gives her potato and pea crops.  What she likes most about her work is taking care of her crops.  She is very happy when they are large and abundant.  She has been doing this for 23 years, and the most difficult is taking the harvest to the Tarma market where she sells her crops.  The bags she uses to take her harvest are very heavy.  Later, she hopes to improve her products in order to be able to get better prices.\r\n\r\nThis is her second loan with MFP.  She knows that she has to make all of her payments punctually, and she is prepared to do so.  She is a very supportive and responsible member of her communal bank.  She will use the requested 1,500 soles to buy pea seeds and sacks of fertilizer.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":596606,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Buy pea seeds and sacks of fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-09-07T17:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maximiliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":550,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:37:29Z","rounded_local_amount":1538.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201326951,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-09-10T06:03:55Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T11:37:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":229413,"name":"Jos\u00e9 Antonio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Jose A.

For convenience sake she brings her products to the wholesale market in the city of Tarma.  It is here that she can obtain the best price.  What she likes most about her job is protecting her crops from the pests that can threaten her production.

She lives in her own home with her husband and their 6 children and 9 grandchildren, for whom she strives daily. She has sold food all her life, and she has always kept on the lookout for construction sites, such as sewer projects, road repairs and public works, so that she can offer her dishes to the workers and engineers. Currently, with the help of her husband and children, they have been able to build stalls to offer an internet service. Her grandchildren help attend to these customers, monitoring the time that customers use this service. This enterprising woman also works on Saturdays and Sundays, selling grilled food and barbecued chicken, since this is the business that she is most passionate about. Her greatest wish is to expand the second floor of her house and be able to spread out her family for everyone's personal comfort. This is her tenth loan with MFP, and she promises to repay all of the quotas as she has repaid the previous loans, since she knows that this is very useful.

She sells to her acquaintances and established customers who purchase the merchandise on credit.  The products she offers are modern and come with affordable prices.  Johanna also buys fresh milk in her neighborhood at a good price and then sells it in the city so that she can generate extra income.  In addition, she prepares peach preserves and sells them in bottles to her acquaintances who are familiar with how she makes this product.  She has future plans to increase her inventory of clothing and shoes, so she will buy a sewing machine to begin making this dream a reality.  Johanna also wants to establish a small workspace where she can prepare sweets and peach nectar.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis is her third loan with MFP.  Johanna promises to submit her payments on time because she wants to continue taking loans to help her move forward and follow through with all of her plans.  She also says she likes working with her fellow group members because they have demonstrated responsibility and punctuality.  Johanna plans to invest the loan she requested in the purchase of shoes since she has several orders to fulfill.  She hopes to generate more income.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":596768,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"Acquire more shoes to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-09-09T07:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Johanna ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":600,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:42Z","rounded_local_amount":104.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172154615,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:00:50Z","rounded_local_amount":209.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588626,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:03:38Z","rounded_local_amount":104.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188725130,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:41:03Z","rounded_local_amount":104.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191463226,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:51:16Z","rounded_local_amount":104.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195886629,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-09-11T16:08:06Z","paid_date":"2011-03-24T08:51:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":229518,"name":"Rosario","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Rosario tiene la edad de 58 a\u00f1os, es casado y tiene 1 hijo de 21 a\u00f1os.

Desde muy joven se ha dedicado ha laborar en distintos oficios, y luego que se junto con su pareja, se le ocurri\u00f3 emprender un nuevo negocio para ayudarle con los gastos del hogar. En la actualidad, y en sociedad con una amiga se dedica a la crianza y comercializaci\u00f3n de pollos, dice que la labor debe ser constante, pues desde muy peque\u00f1os los polluelos requieren de esmerados cuidados para lograr crecer sin dificultad. Al principio fue f\u00e1cil, pero a medida que aumentaba estos animales tuvieron que trasladarlos a un espacio m\u00e1s amplio. Le gusta mucho el negocio de comercializaci\u00f3n de pollos, pues \u00e9stos crecen r\u00e1pido y en solo un mes ya los pueden vender. Pero lo que no le gusta es subir el cerro donde esta ubicada el galp\u00f3n, pues es algo dificultoso, ya que ella adolece de los ri\u00f1ones. Y como es una mujer emprendedora tiene grandes sue\u00f1os para ampliar este negocio, y uno de ellos es comprar un terreno para aumentar la cantidad de pollos, y as\u00ed mejorar sus ganancias. Es el primer cr\u00e9dito que tiene con MFP, y promete pagar con puntualidad sus cuotas, ya que desea seguir trabajando en busca del progreso, adem\u00e1s esta muy agradecida con todas las personas que hicieron posible el dinero que le permitir\u00e1 ampliar su negocio.

She lives in the company of her 30-year old husband, Ronald, who is a factory worker, and her 2 small children.  Together, they live in a populated neighborhood north of the city.  \r\n<p>\r\nSince she was young, she has worked in different jobs but after marrying her husband, she decided to start a new business to help with the household expenses.  Now, in association with a friend, she works raising and selling chickens.  She says that the work must be constant because from the time that they are very small, the chicks require a great deal of care so that they grow without any difficulty.  At the beginning it was easy, but as the number of animals increased, they had to take them to a larger space.  She likes selling chickens very much \u2013 they grow quickly and they can be sold in just a month.  However, what she doesn\u2019t like is going up the hill to where the barn is located, as it is difficult since she has backaches.\r\n<p>\r\nSince she is an enterprising woman, she has big dreams to expand this business and one of those dreams is to purchase a piece of land to increase the number of chickens and, in that way, increase her earnings. \r\n<p>\r\nThis is her first loan with MFP and she promises to make her payments punctually, since she wants to continue working in search of progress.  In addition, she is very grateful for all of the people that made this loan possible, which will allow her to expand her business.  Ana plans to invest the loan requested in the purchase of balanced diet and vitamins to provide better care to her chicks.

He and his wife are dairy farmers and they have a three year old son.\r\n\r\nHe is a very responsible person who is dedicated to the work he does.  He has four head of dairy cattle.  He has been in this line of work since he was very young because his mother did the same.  Because he is the youngest sibling he was always at her side working with her.  Juan Carlos\u2019 mother died six years ago due to an illness she fought against since she was a little girl and got Chagas disease.

He is asking for funds to buy a truckload of soy husks which is the feed for his cattle so that he can generate higher income and produce more milk.
