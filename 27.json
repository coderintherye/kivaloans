To overcome this situation and support her family, she opened a bar in her house where several workers from a brick factory, located a few blocks away, come to eat. Baudelina began selling beverages and sweets; little by little she started to have a regular clientele, first with 5 people until today where she serves lunch to more or less 25 people every day at different times. Her business is doing very well; she's been able to advance little by little. Her children can go to school and have a good life thanks to the revenues from the bar. Baudelina is seeing a considerable increase in her number of clients, therefore she would like to buy two long tables and chairs to sit 12 people, as well as plates, utensils and glasses. She needs these items urgently since she does not have enough of them.

She uses a sewing machine that she obtained thanks to her savings. Delfina has been increasing her number of clients and this has generated better income for her, which helps add to the income she earns from the clothing assembly shop where she works.

This will enable her to work more quickly and increase her production. The machine she currently has only holds two spools, and this prevents her from sewing many of the styles people request. Delina has already decided on the sewing machine she wants to buy and it costs $350.00.

Four of her children are going to school and the other two are still at home.\r\nBefore Milly joined Life in Africa she used to be a full time house wife and didn't have much to do. Life was really not so easy, having many children to take care of and also having to sustain the family. At the time, her husband was also facing some problems with his work that was on a contract basis, where sometimes the payments would be delayed.\r\n<br><br>\r\nMilly is a creative wife and she was involved in making crafts on a small scale at her home, which she would sell in order to try to raise an income for the family. The income generated was not really enough to sustain the family bills and needs and as a result, Milly chose to search for work to sustain the family. After a little searching, Milly was able to find work with Life in Africa. She was one of the people on the Invisible Children bracelet project. This job was a great support in boosting the family's income, but life has to go on. Milly, as a member of Life in Africa, is very instrumental in the community; she is very good in making handcrafts and also at sharing her craft making knowledge with the other community members. She has good interpersonal skills and consistent conduct.\r\n<br><br>\r\nFrom the salary earned and her savings, Milly was able to make an investment in the form of building rental houses. She managed to build three single room tenant houses and currently two are occupied and the other one is still incomplete. The first two single room rental houses also still need plastering. Currently, Milly has been charging 50,000 Ugandan shillings per room for the two rooms and has been generating an income of 100,000 shillings.

is a thirty year old father of two young children, ages 1.5 and 4. He has had his business selling bicycle parts for two years. Operating out of Lupida, a small town in western Kenya, Peter sells all types of parts, including tires, rims, breaks, spokes, and peddles. \r\n\r\nCurrently, the biggest obstacle he faces is a lack of capital. There is high demand for bicycle parts in the area because bicycles are the central form of transportation in the region. It is the main way that people move from town to town, from the farm to home, etc, and bicycles are even used as an integral form of commercial transportation. Called \u2018Boda bodas\u2019, young men put pads onto the back of their bikes and take people for rides for about 10 Kenya Schillings (1 USD is about 67 Ksh).\r\n\r\nAs it is, Peter receives 10-20 customers per day, and is able to collect a daily profit of about 150-200 Ksh. He hopes to receive a Kiva loan so that he can increase his supply of bicycle parts, and believes that with a loan, he can increase his profits to 300-400 Ksh per day. \r\n\r\nPeter\u2019s business helps him to provide for his two young children. He is able to give them the basic necessities, but in the near future he will have to start paying for school fees.

years ago Maria decided to start her own store out of her home. She started off with just $100 in capital and slowly was able to increase her product line and her customer base. She now sells basic foods and snacks for kids. She opens her business every morning and closes late at night. With profits above her expectations, Maria has been continuously investing in her business.<p>Late last year, Maria received a loan so she could invest in meats such as beef and chicken. She was able to invest successfully and make some minor improvements to her store. She is now looking forward to receiving another loan and investing in dairy products.<p>Maria moved to Guayaquil from Esmeraldas, a predominantly Afro community, about ten years ago.

She has been able to expand her business with loans provided by Micro Invest.<p>As leather goods are in demand only in wintertime, Muattarhon decided to add other services to her business. These services include sewing cloaks and jackets for the spring and autumn seasons from fabrics other than leather.

After getting married she did not like idling around waiting for her husband to put food on her table. Therefore Rehema started off by saving Ksh 20 (about US$0.3) from every coin that her husband gave her to buy food for the day. She did it for 2 years until she managed to save Ksh 10,000 (US$150). With this money, Rehema rented a stall at Mlolongo for Ksh 1,000 a month. She then began to travel to rural areas where cereals are sold cheaply. She bought her first stock of cereals and started her sales business in year 2000. The business has been doing well, and now Rehema wants to expand it. She sees that the town is growing at a rapid rate, and therefore her supply may no longer be enough.          \r\nRehema is asking for a loan of US$350, so that she can purchase a weighing machine and a variety of cereals.

is 57 years old, married, and has 3 children. He lives in Ruai town, in the outskirts of Nairobi, Kenya. Leonard started his hardware shop in 2003 when he retired. He had previously worked as a salesman with three of the top food and other manufacturing companies in Kenya, namely East African Industries, Warner Company, and Proctar and Allan. \r\nWhile in employment, Leonard was saving money with one of the Sacco Societies in Kenya called Jitegemee Saving and Credit. After retiring, he pulled together his resources and started a hardware shop with a capital of Ksh 200,000 (US$2,860). His wife who works with Kenya Polytechnic, a technical institute in Kenya, lent him a part of this capital. Leonard started out by renting a small stall by the roadside of the main Ruai \u2013 Kangundo road. Unfortunately, the Ministry of Works demolished his shop along with other structures located near the road. This significantly affected his business, but he did not lose hope. Within three months, Leonard was able to rent another shop that has been operating ever since.  \r\nIn the recent past, Leonard has been having difficulties in fulfilling his customers\u2019 demands that are increasing day by day because of his fair pricing of goods. By making purchases from his shop, his customers save a lot of time, since, otherwise, they would have to go all the way to Nairobi in order to purchase the same goods. Leornard is therefore asking for a loan of US$350 which he will use to purchase more stock for his hardware shop, including items like jikos (traditional cooking stoves), plastic basins, sufurias (cooking pots), spades, etc. These are items that are in very high demand; therefore, their acquisition will make a big difference for the community that Leonard is supplying. The loan will also help improve the condition for Leonard's children, his aging mother and mother in law who depend on him. He plans to employ two helpers from the community to assist in day-to-day running of the shop. The repayment period for his loan will be 8 -14 months."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":47006,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchase of stock for a hardware shop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Ruai, Nairobi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":36,"posted_date":"2007-07-05T23:44:21Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leonard","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-07-20T03:27:47Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":350,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2007-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2007-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2007-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2007-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2008-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2008-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2008-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":44,"local_amount":44,"processed_date":"2007-09-20T09:18:52Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-20T09:08:41Z","rounded_local_amount":44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":56742,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":44,"local_amount":44,"processed_date":"2007-10-20T09:21:55Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-20T09:08:41Z","rounded_local_amount":44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":69891,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":44,"local_amount":44,"processed_date":"2007-11-20T10:23:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-20T09:08:41Z","rounded_local_amount":44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":84124,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":44,"local_amount":44,"processed_date":"2007-12-20T10:25:43Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-20T09:08:41Z","rounded_local_amount":44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":99933,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":44,"local_amount":44,"processed_date":"2008-01-20T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-20T09:08:41Z","rounded_local_amount":44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118728,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":44,"local_amount":44,"processed_date":"2008-02-20T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-20T09:08:41Z","rounded_local_amount":44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":138892,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":44,"local_amount":44,"processed_date":"2008-03-20T10:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-20T09:08:41Z","rounded_local_amount":44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":161937,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":42,"local_amount":42,"processed_date":"2008-04-20T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-20T09:08:41Z","rounded_local_amount":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":187089,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2007-07-06T03:27:47Z","paid_date":"2008-04-20T09:08:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":11,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":13503,"name":"Lawrence","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lawrence W. is a 41-year-old man; he is married and has 3 children.
