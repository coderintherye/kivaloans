She has been in this business for 18 years now and has employed one person.

M. is a married woman who lives in Brgy.

Her husband, Antonio M., Jr., is 51 years old and works as a pumpboat captain to earn his living. He also helps with his wife's business activities. They have five children who are from 14 to 24 years old; two of her children have their own families and one is currently going to school. \r\n\r\nGrace joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 11 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Grace has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 25,000 Philippines pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 12,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 12th loan, she is borrowing PHP 29,500, which she intends to use to buy stock for the store and as a down payment for a new motorcycle. She hopes to continue to save for the future and for her children's education. \r\n\r\nGrace M. is a Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means honorable) woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:  <\/b>In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon.

His previous loan of 11,000 Philippines pesos (PHP) helped him earn a monthly profit of PHP 20,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for his 10th loan, he is borrowing PHP 11,000, which he intends to use to buy fishing gear and equipment so that he can continue to save up for the future expansion of his business. \r\n\r\nBonifacio is a Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means honorable) man who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of his dreams.  \r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF: <\/b>In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon.

She is married and has two children, aged 30 and 26.  \r\n\r\nIn 2007, she established her cow-raising business. Working seven days a week and three hours a day, she supports her family.  \r\n\r\nShe has already received and successfully repaid one loan from Patan BPW and used her most recent to buy a young, milk-giving cow.  \r\n\r\nIn the future, Saraswati plans to uplift the economic condition of her family. She thanks you for your support. \r\n\r\nDairy cows are an important source of nutrition and income in Nepal. Cows are never raised for beef, but for their milk from which curd (duy) and fresh cheese (paneer) are made.  \r\n\r\nJersey cows are the preferred breed for milking. On average, a dairy cow in Nepal will produce about 10 liters of milk each day. In the local market, a liter of milk sells for about $0.50. In addition to producing milk, cows provide dung that is used in home construction, as fuel for fires, and can be captured in methane storage tanks. The purchase of a dairy cow, made possible through a Kiva loan, is an investment that will repay itself many times over.  \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI (microfinance institution), Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007. Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business-training programs to low-income women.\r\n\r\nIn addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.

Juana and her daughter live in a family member's home that they share with her nieces and nephews.  Juana's separation from her husband and her immense desire to get herself and her 16 year-old daughter ahead in life, drove her entrepreneurial spirit, with which she has succeeded in setting up businesses that support herself and which will almost certainly allow her to reach her dream of turning her daughter into a successful professional.\n\nJuana and her daughter currently share a family member's house with her nieces and nephews.  They live in a small part of the house where, for ten years now, Juana has worked making brooms, floor cloths and brushes.  She learned this trade from a friend who saw that she was having difficulties in making income.  Juana trained and learned how to make her products and also how to run her business and make her own opportunities.  With some savings she had, she was able to buy all the tools and supplies that she needed to carry out her business.\n\nJuana also started out in another business activity, selling soft drinks, sweet treats and other general snacks.  She now has the basic machinery, tools, chiller cabinet and shelving that she needs to carry out her income-generating business activities.  Through her businesses, she has managed to support her family.  A brother and a nephew help her to make her products and she has also created 10 jobs for other people in her community on whom she relies for her sales in the town of Barranquilla and in the towns of Atl\u00e1ntico and Bol\u00edvar departments.\n\nJuana tells us that her sellers' orders have increased recently and also, during the month of December, her other business selling drinks and snacks saw an upturn in sales.\n\nThis is Juana's first loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She will use this Kiva loan to buy materials for making her products: straw, cotton, wooden bars and cleaning brushes.

The members decided to give the group this name because it is the name of the neighborhood where they all live. \r\n\r\nThis story is about Silvia C. V. since she is the group's president.  Silvia is 37 years old, married, and has four children: Arturo, Areli, KarL. and Alejandro.  All four are in school.  The first two are in the sixth and fifth year of elementary school, the third is in the third year of pre-school and the youngest is barely a year old.  Silvia owns a fruit store.\r\n\r\nSilvia decided to start out in this business because a family member told her that it was a very good source of income.  She also knew that it would help her to support her husband with their household expenses and their children's education expenses and would improve their family's quality of life.  Silvia invested her loan in buying merchandise such as: apples, bananas, oranges, tomatoes, chili peppers, onions, potatoes, carrots, cucumbers, lettuce and other fruit and veg.\r\n\r\nSilvia is very happy because she says that her business is doing very well.  Both her sales and her number of customers have increased quite a bit.  This means that her profits have also risen satisfactorily, so much so, in fact, that she has even been able to buy an iron.\r\n\r\nSilvia's goal is to continue supporting her children in their studies so that they can finish complete their higher education and have a better future.  She would also like to grow her small business some more since she would like to expand the premises where she has her fruit store a little.  This will mean that she can better stock her store and thereby sell a wider range of produce and improve her profits.\r\n\r\nSilvia tells us that her group works very well since all the members have known each other for some time and they are very responsible in making their repayments since they don't want to let people down after they have placed their trust in them and supported them.\r\n\r\nSilvia is very grateful to Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad and Kiva lenders for the unconditional support that they are providing since it has meant that her quality of life and that of her family has improved and she has been able to continue investing in her business.\r\n\r\nThe names and business activities of the rest of the Huamuchapa group members follow below:\r\n\r\nCelia C.

She makes figurines from 10 cm to 3 meters tall, and what she sells most are angels.  \r\n<p>\r\nFlorentina sells her figurines in the community, and in neighboring communities, as well as in street markets and fairs.  At the time of requesting the loan, she is very happy.  She wants this loan in order to buy the necessary supplies such as paints, varnishes, hardeners and stones in order to fulfill her orders.  Also, she hopes with her earnings to be able to buy a polisher in order to save time and get out her orders quickly since up until now, she has been doing it by hand.

She sells breakfast like bread, cafe, tea, sausages, plantains, etc. She will use the profits to continue improving her business while saving part of it to visit or send to her family in Haiti, when they have any needs.

The town is inhabited by Mixtec indians from the coastal area.  The group is made up of 12 native indians from this town and Mrs. Cresenciana B. M. is their leader.\r\n\r\nThe name given to the group is due to the characteristics of the diversity of the vegetation, trees, plants, birds and animals that are autoctonus to the area.  Before we reach the town we can see a beautiful river that flows majectically in a clean stream.  The landscape always catches our attention.  The people here work mainly in agriculture.  Women usually focus on weaving belts which is a craft that comes from long ago.  The traditions of the local indian folk are still very much alive and we are able to witness first hand the majestic attire and ceremonies that capture the attention of everyone visiting the area. \r\n\r\nIn this narrative we will talk about a member named Ninfa Garc\u00eda Mej\u00eda who is 40 years old, married to Eleuterio who is 42 years old and has been a field worker all his life.  They have three children: Jos\u00e9 Luis who is 15 and in his third year of secondary school, Ra\u00fal who is 13 and in his first year of secondary school and Elizabeth who is 10 years old and in 5th grade.\r\n\r\nNinfa has been making artisan crafts, napkins, tablecloths, and waistbands since she was 13 years old.  The girls in the community always learn this type of art just as they learn how to make tortillas, cook and take care of children.  For Ninfa this activity has been the best alternative she's had to help her husband and children with household expenses.  Just like her, most women do this to provide an education for their children and also maintain the traditional artform that has been handed down for generations. \r\n\r\nNinfa joined this group to get financing for her business.  She plans to use the loan to buy while cotton thread, which she uses as the basis for her textile products, different colored cotton yarn, and spun woolen thread to finish the tablecloths and napkins.  With this purchase she will be able to guarantee production and more sales.  She will use the income to cover education costs for her children, pay back the loan and continue making her crafts.\r\n\r\nNinfa would like to sell her products in other locations in the state of Oaxaca.  She wants to improve her lifestyle and her home so her children will have better prospects in the future.\r\n\r\nShe places her hopes on her three children so that when they grow into responsible people they will help her and her husband.  She wants her children to be professionals so they won't have to live in poverty.  We musn't forget that the indigenous populations do not have access to basic services for development.  It is a sector of society that has been abandoned.  Working the fields does not guarantee a comfortable lifestyle.  Ninfa invites people around the world to join the just cause for those who have less.  She thanks Kiva for opening the door to hope and the Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad for showing its committment to this abandoned sector, also for the confidence shown in their indigenous women.\r\n\r\n\"Primavera\" is made up of 12 indigenous women.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap & toothpaste in the local community. Corazon has been engaged in her business for over 6 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Corazon joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Corazon has successfully repaid a previous loan of 18,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Corazon is requesting a new loan of 23,000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand product offering. This will be the 3rd loan taken out by Corazon from ASKI.

Z. is a married woman who lives in Tak-an, Danao City, Cebu. \r\n\r\nShe earns her living by operating three business ventures: hog raising, general store and livestock. \r\n\r\nHer husband, Emmanuel, who is 51 years old, works as a laborer to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have one child who is 17 years old and is currently going to school.  \r\n\r\nLucilita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired to something better for her family. With the help of her past seven loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Lucilita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 18,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 15,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her eighth cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 20,000, which she intends to use to buy feed, medicines and vaccines for her pigs and stocks for the general store so that she can continue to save up for her child's education and for future home repairs. \r\n\r\nLucilita Z. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\"). NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon, a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She gets help by her life partner to make the breakfast and lunch foods that are sold to the students at the university. It is hard work but it is the only source of income for their household and it is the way they are able to provide for all of their needs.

It is made of aluminum sheeting and they want to expand the stall as their earnings grow.

She is 48 years old. Nida is the group leader of a 6-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nNida is married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Nida owns & operates a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling both food & daily use products in the local community. Nida has been engaged in her business for over 9 years and earns approximately 6000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Nida joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Nida has successfully repaid a previous loan of 12,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. Nida is requesting a new loan of 18,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. This will be the 4th loan taken out by Nida from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She has a kiosk business while her husband is a tailor.  They run the businesses at their house. Elsy and her husband are hard workers; they always work together to meet their family's needs.\r\n  \r\nEsly usually operates her kiosk from 6 a.m. until 9 p.m. She sells variety of snack items, noodles, sugar, cigarettes, detergent, biscuits, soap and many other household needs. She started her kiosk business by using her own money as business capital.  Her money just enabled her to buy a variety of small items. She was only able to generate a meager income from her kiosk. \r\n\r\nEsly joined TLM\u2019s small group lending program for two loan cycles. All loan money was used to add more items to her kiosk. She can generate a better income from the improved business stock. However, she still wants to expand her kiosk by selling basic household needs such as rice, kerosene and gasoline that are not available at her kiosk at the moment. For that reason, she is requesting an individual loan amounting to IDR 3,000,000 from TLM. She definitely believes that loan will help her to improve her business.

O S.

Three of the children are in school. Thidora and her family live in Taklale village. \r\n<p>\r\nTo support her husband in meeting their family\u2019s needs, Thidora runs a small kiosk. Her husband provided her with a small amount of money to buy noodles, sugar, coffee, a variety of snacks, cigarettes, detergent, soap, etc. Besides working at home, she loves running her business, as it generates income for her family. \r\n<p>\r\nThidora sees that she could earn more if she could stock her kiosk with a greater variety of goods. Taklale village is situated in a remote area, around thirty kilometers from Kupang City, and most of the community members in the village are farmers. Thidora is requesting a loan amounting to 10,000,000 IDR in order to stock her kiosk with a larger variety of basic household needs such as rice, kerosene, frying oil, etc. She hopes TLM might be able to help her in realizing her plan.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":427.5,"image":{"id":701763,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She is married and has four children.  Her husband deals in electronics. She assists her husband with the payment of the family's expenses. Her loan will be used to buy more food supplies and also cassava to make 'gari' for sale. She hopes to use the new profits from her business to re-invest back into the food selling business.\r\n\r\nTo prepare 'gari', she gets fresh raw cassava from the market. She washes and peels the cassava, and then sends it to the mill to be milled into dough.\r\nShe puts the dough in a sack and places heavy stones or wood on it. The stones are placed to drain the starch out of the dough. She leaves the dough for a day or two depending on the weight of the stones.\r\n\r\nAfter this process, she stir-fries the 'gari' in a pan on a fire. The 'gari' is then left to cool and bagged in small bags for sale. \r\n\r\n'Gari' is a starchy food  that is mostly enjoyed by students and large families in Ghana. Students eat 'gari' a lot because it is a quick and easy food to prepare. They soak 'gari' mix with condensed milk and water and sometimes add peanuts. Some students also prepare 'gari' in the form of dough and eat it with pepper sauce and sardines.\r\n\r\nFamilies also eat 'gari' for lunch or supper, usually served with soup or pepper sauce. The soups that mostly accompany 'gari' are okra soup, groundnut (peanut) soup, palm nut soup, and vegetable soup. Various sauces can be eaten with 'gari' such as pepper sauce, curry sauce, and tomato sauce. The variety of the sauce served with 'gari' depends on the family\u2019s preferences.

The members of the group decided on this name, because of the etymology of Pinotepa; this was the name the town was known by in the colonial era, and it means, \"Place where the Pinome lords have their palaces.\" Pinomes are said to be a savage race that lived here before the conquests of Mesoamerica, and according to research, they came from the northern part of the country and had some qualities from the Sioux indians, also known as the Cherokee. The Pinomes were subjugated by the Mexica\/Aztecs, to whom they paid tribute, and who gave them this name. They were thereafter conquered by the Zapoteca culture and finally by the Mixteca, who controlled this area until the Spanish arrived, bringing African slaves and other customs.\r\nIt should be noted that Pinotepa was one of the richest areas during the pre-Hispanic and colonial eras; information exists that in Pinotepa, they had the best weaving, production of cocoa, salt, cotton, turkeys, cochineal, and indigo, as well as various bird feathers from those living in the area. We can still observe in the surrounding area that the indigenous towns produce woven belts made with purple snail dye. Currently some of the goods made here are exclusively designed Converse footwear, made in Pinotepa de don Luis, 30 minutes from Pinotepa Nacional.\r\n\r\nAfter this historical overview, we will shift focus to the group, made up of 10 women from this neighborhood. Their leader is Ana Liz N. A., but this request focuses specifically on Lucia Matilde O. N., a young woman, 26 years old, single and living with her parents. She works selling natural products, including food supplements. Lucia started this business two years ago, first using these products, then recommending and distributing them. In her testimony she indicates that she started using these products because of a health problem, and after seeing her health improve, she decided to start selling them and recommending them to people. Initially it was difficult, but she began gaining more customers, until reaching the current level. She says that the business is doing well, and improving every day.\r\nLucia joined a credit group in order to obtain money to buy some products she needed. With this loan she was able to purchase, shakes, vitamins, energy drinks, aloe, treatments for gastritis and other health problems. \r\nLucia dreams of a house of her own. She hopes that her business will continue growing, that her sales don't fall, because she would like to have her own location, where she would no longer have to pay rent. She says that she would also like to get married and have children, but not before first ensuring her comfort and well-being.\r\nShe is very grateful to Fundacion for the opportunity to obtain this loan, and hopes to continue to receive their support in the future, because without them, many people would have to give up their dreams and projects.\r\n\r\n\"Pinotecpan\" is a group of 10 women, their names and businesses are as follows:\r\n\r\nGuadalupe M.
