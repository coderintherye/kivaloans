She lives with her two daughters: Rosa Mar\u00eda and Marisa, who she cares for in her own home, located in the city of Cajas.  Thanks to her work and her sacrifice she has been able to obtain a lot of agricultural land and to build a welcoming home, where she cared for her children, all of whom are now older and more independent.  Now her life focuses on caring for her animals.  She has 87 guinea pigs, 4 sheep and one cow, and she cares for them with great dedication.  Her secret is planting alfalfa, which she uses to feed them.  In addition, she has prepared a room in her house that she uses to sell meals on the weekends.  Now her customers know her for the tasty dishes that she makes.  She also plants corn from Cuzco on her agricultural land.  This season she only used one parcel because she rented the other land for a good price.  Currently she hopes to obtain a good harvest, since she has worked hard caring for the crop.  Now she wants to increase her livestock, since recently she sold an average of 300 guinea pigs and for next season she needs to stock up on her livestock for sale.  She belongs to the communal bank \"San Lorenzo\" and this is her 12th loan from Kiva field partner MFP.

In order to buy more animals, Beyshenbubu has turned to \"Bai-Tushum and partners\" for a loan of 60,000 som (KGS).

Currently Churek lives with her daughter-in-law and her grandson, while her son is away to Russia to earn money. \r\n\r\nChurek was born into a simple family of a sheep herder. After school she attended Prjewalski co-op institute to earn her degree as a saleswoman. Upon finishing her studies Churek moved to the Moskovski region where she had relatives and started working as a milkmaid in the \"Druzhba\" farming co-op in the Aleksandrovka village. In 1981 she married a tractor driver from the same co-op. The young family received a house from the co-op's administration and Churek's four children were born there. They lived and worked for the co-op for 20 years, raised their children there, slowly purchased their own herd of livestock. After the farming co-op broke apart with the fall of the Soviet Union, they lost their jobs and were forced to sell their livestock and move to the Rovnoe village in Panfilovski region, where they were able to buy a house. Churek's husband started working as a mechanic in \"Shapak\" farming co-op and Churek took care of the house and children. \r\n\r\nIn 2003 Churek and her husband decided to start raising livestock again and purchased a heifer. Their livestock business began with 5,000 som (KGS) and it grew to yield 7,000 som (KGS) monthly profits. In 2010 Churek's husband passed away and she became her family's main provider. Her hard work and determination allowed Churek to continue her husband's business and currently her herd has two milk cows and a heifer. In order to purchase more animals she has turned to \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" for a loan of 100,000 som (KGS). Churek is planning to use the profits from this loan to purchase more animals and in the future save enough money for her grandson's education.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1016553,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Rovnoe village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-02-27T23:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-28T23:50:03Z","loan_amount":2150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Churek","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"loan_amount":2150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2013-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2013-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":537.5},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":537.5},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":537.5},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":537.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-02-29T00:04:48Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":397872,"name":"Nabi","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u041d\u0430\u0431\u0438 \u0436\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c \u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0420\u0443\u0434\u0430\u043a\u0438. \u0415\u043c\u0443 26 \u043b\u0435\u0442. \u041e\u043d \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0442. \u041e\u043d \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u043c. \u0412 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u041d\u0430\u0431\u0438 \u0447\u0435\u0442\u044b\u0440\u0435 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430. \u041a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0431\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0442 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043e\u0431\u043e\u0440\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043f\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0435\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0441\u0435\u043c\u044f\u043d \u0446\u0432\u0435\u0442\u043a\u043e\u0432, \u0447\u0442\u043e\u0431\u044b \u0437\u0430\u043d\u044f\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u0446\u0432\u0435\u0442\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u043c.

For 12 years, Maria has been earning a living by selling food such as chuchitos (small corn tamales), bread with chicken, atole, toast, enchiladas, and other traditional foods of the region.  <p>\r\n\r\nWith hard work and determination, Maria was able to purchase a small store in the market two years ago, which she now operates from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday through Saturday. While her sales have increased, Maria  depleted all of her savings in order to purchase the store. Looking for a small loan to be able to purchase more materials, Maria decided to join the Seagulls Trust Bank, comprised of seven members who have 29 children among them. Their businesses range from restaurants to veterinary assistance to tortilla-making. Like Maria, they are all striving to make a better life for their families. <p>\r\n\r\nMaria, who has expanded her product line to include purified water, sodas, smoothies and meals, hopes to one day have a larger store to accommodate more customers. \"My group and I feel fortunate that people in other countries, who don't even know us, are willing to support us financially,\" said Maria. \"Our families are benefiting, which is our goal. We can accomplish great things in our country if we have the support from others and we continue to work hard.\" \r\n "}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1017145,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase more materials for food-making.

Seluia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1950 WST from SPBD. This previous loan was used to purchase fishing equipment, including hooks & nets.  Seluia is requesting a new loan of 2450 WST, which will be used to purchase a fishing boat. This will be the 4th loan taken out by Seluia from SPBD.

","en":"Darika is 55 years old. She has three children. In the search of an income source for her family, four years ago Darika launched a livestock business with the starting capital of 5,000 KGS.Thanks to Darika\u2019s hard work, her farm today has two dairy cows and 15 sheep, which allows her to earn about 8,000 KGS from sales of dairy and meat products. In order to grow her business further, Darika turned to \u201cBai Tushum & Partners\u201d for a loan in the amount of 40,000 KGS for the purpose of buying sheep and goats. Darika plans to reinvest her revenues in expanding her livestock further."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1017286,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Tendik village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-02-28T17:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-29T17:00:02Z","loan_amount":875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Darika","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":40000,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2012-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":437.5},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":437.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-02-29T00:12:09Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":396281,"name":"Ni\u00f1o Salvador Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Las mismas son reconocidas en el lugar como mujeres muy trabajadoras y luchadoras, ellas son las integrantes del grupo Ni\u00f1o Salvador, el cual est\u00e1 integrado por 19 mujeres de la ciudad de San Lorenzo.

The group is very active and dynamic; it is composed of seven women, dedicated to various commercial and production activities, such as: sale of clothing, animal husbandry, and the sale of meat, which are sold in the community or the nearest market (20 minutes away from the village). All the members are neighbors and know one another.  This is their third loan cycle, and their two previous loans with Friendship Bridge were paid in full and on time. \n\nMaria Francisca, treasurer of the group, is forty-six years old, married and has four daughters. In recent years Maria Francisca has been a working with livestock, rather than weaving. She sells her products in the market nearby (20 minutes from where she lives) on Mondays, Wednesdays and Saturdays. Maria Francisca believes strongly in good education, although she did not have the opportunity to attend school herself, but she encourages her daughters, currently in kindergarten, 1st, 4th and 5th grades, to stay in school.  Her dream is that they graduate from high school and ultimately from college. \n\nWith the new loan, Maria Francisca wants to increase her sales. She plans to add variety to her business, so she will buy more chickens, turkeys, ducks and pigs to meet her clients\u2019 needs. With her income Maria Francisca can provide better standard of living for her family, as the cost of living has increased and her husband's income is not enough. Maria Francisca is very optimistic about the future; she hopes to be more successful through growing her business with the support of her daughters. \n\nMaria Francisca and her Trust Bank are very grateful that people from around the world know about them and take time to invest in them. They believe that Friendship Bridge and Kiva loans make a difference in their lives. \"Wow, technology has advanced, and there are no barriers to support another human being,\" says Francisca Maria Larios."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1011325,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy more chickens, turkeys, ducks and pigs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Chimaltenango","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.666667 -90.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":55,"posted_date":"2012-02-28T20:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-29T20:30:02Z","loan_amount":2500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Francisca ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marta Julia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dominga ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hilaria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vicenta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francisca ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irma Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":19500,"loan_amount":2500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1950},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1950},{"due_date":"2012-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1950},{"due_date":"2012-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1950},{"due_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1950},{"due_date":"2012-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1950},{"due_date":"2012-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1950},{"due_date":"2012-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1950},{"due_date":"2012-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1950},{"due_date":"2012-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1950}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-02-29T03:44:13Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":396271,"name":"Flor San Juanera Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Flor San Juanera, \"Saint John Flowers\" Trust bank is located in San Juan Sacatepequez, a small town outside Guatemala City in the central highlands of Guatemala where a large percentage of the country\u2019s of flowers are grown.

Although she has a small space in her house, she wants to be closer to new clients and display her products in the market, that way she would be able to sell more product and generate more income to support her family. \n\nOn behalf of her Trust Bank partners, Rosa Maria, says, \u201cI am very happy that people from other countries who have more possibilities, have the desire to help those who intend to move forward with small businesses. I thank Kiva investors for opening the doors of opportunity for the benefit of our families and community.\"\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1013228,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"To purchase fabric and thread to fill the orders she has.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Chimaltenango","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.666667 -90.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":55,"posted_date":"2012-02-28T20:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-29T20:30:02Z","loan_amount":3850,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Del Rosario ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Santos ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Adela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Damaris Nohemi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sonia Maribel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Lucrecia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Astrid Marllene ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Evelin Yesenia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":30000,"loan_amount":3850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2012-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2012-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2012-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2012-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2012-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2012-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2012-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":385},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":385},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":385},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":385},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":385},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":385},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":385},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":385},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":385},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":385}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-03-01T03:13:53Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":398244,"name":"Virginia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Virginia is 29 years old and lives in the Philippines.

Thanks to Seyde's persistent work, today her business has two cows, seven heads of sheep and one horse, and yields about 12,000 som from sales of milk and meat products.  Also, Seyde works on 2.28 hectares of land, where she grows cereal crops, potatoes and sainfoin.  In order to further develop her business, she requested a loan in the sum of 60,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy livestock.
