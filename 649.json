International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Fifty-five-year-old Kaloli says his moment was 26 years ago when his current business, clothes sales, in Mityana took root. \r\nFrom the threshold, he was hard pressed in the fast-track pace of his enterprise. Nothing, especially from a business point of view, can grow by leaps and bounds unless it\u2019s under the auspices of some pillar of support. Kaloli faced considerable odds in obtaining a firm footing for his business. \r\nWhat was of overriding importance, notwithstanding the odds, was the fact that his business had indeed taken root. \r\nKaloli explored all avenues to find success. He met with checkered success; it has been a long drawn out road for Kaloli. What has made his business secure is the fact that he has been able to restock his boutique when he runs short of clothes.  On the side, Kaloli also ekes out side income from his farming business.

This area is also adjacent to the towns of Soledad, Sabanagrande, and Santo Tom\u00e1s.  Malambo is known for having a special demographic composition because the residents are a mix of people from all over the country.  They came to work either independently, for a company, or as part of the Malambo Industrial Park, S.A. (or PIMSA), which is an industrial complex that provides a complete infrastructure of services.  This complex was designed to ensure cost savings to companies that located their facilities there and would guarantee a sufficient pool of labor to the local businesses.  \r\n<p>\r\nEva has a business called \u201cVariedades Eva\u201d (Eva\u2019s Varieties) where she sells sewing supplies, stationery, women\u2019s accessories, and household goods.  She has a customer base that knows her because of her work and her warm personality.  Her customers can find a little bit of everything they need.  Her business was started with the help of her husband, who invested a small amount of capital from his savings when he worked at a company.  At first, she began selling various products to her neighbors and gradually over time she acquired display cabinets and more operating capital.  As of now, Eva has received 20 loans through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She used the money to expand her customer base, make larger cash purchases, and extend lines of credit to her customers.   Eva still remembers the first loan she received, which was in the amount of 180,000 COP.  She received subsequent loans and used them to grow.  As a result, she was nominated to receive the City Bank Award for her excellence in developing her business.  This reflects her growth and the formalization of her business process.  Even though there have been significant challenges since starting her business three years ago, the insecurity of recent times has greatly diminished her operating capital.   However, this impasse has caused her to move forward intelligently and effectively manage this crisis. \r\n<p>\r\nEva is now applying for a Kiva loan in order to buy sewing supplies, women\u2019s accessories, and stationery.  She plans to restock her business with products that sell very quickly.  By managing her inventory, Eva will be able to reduce transportation costs and create opportunities to increase her sales because of her ability to obtain good discounts.  While Eva moves forward with her daily work, she is able to achieve profitability of at least 30%, which has a significant impact on the welfare of her household.

She also does very well selling meals near a school.  The children and teachers buy from her when they want something to eat.  \r\n<p>\r\nShe is requesting a loan to buy jewelry to sell so that she can obtain good earnings.  One of her dreams is to see her children finish their studies, find a good job, and establish their own large businesses that they manage themselves.  Patricia thanks Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad for the support it has provided so that she can move forward and fulfill her dreams.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":821117,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Jewelry","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy jewelry for her business.

Su principal mercado son los grandes confeccionistas a quienes les ofrece el servicio de maquila, mujeres a quienes les confecciona sobre sus medidas y almacenes y miscel\u00e1neas. Mabel inici\u00f3 su negocio desde el a\u00f1o 2005, cuando despu\u00e9s de haber trabajado en una confecci\u00f3n, se retir\u00f3 para emprender su propia aventura de negocios en un taller de confecciones, que ubic\u00f3 en el sitio de su vivienda. Ella compr\u00f3 mediante 2 cr\u00e9ditos las maquinarias de segunda mano, que pag\u00f3 fabricando jeans, a quien se las vendi\u00f3.

Su mayor desaf\u00edo es la selecci\u00f3n de clientes que solicitan cr\u00e9ditos a largo plazo y ella no tiene las condiciones de capital para financiar totalmente su cartera.

She crafts all styles of clothing. Her primary market is the large wholesalers, offering them manufacturing services. A group of women who produce according to specifications and the products are destined for clothing, and general stores. Mabel started out her business in 2005 after having retired from her employment as a seamstress. She decided to take up her own business venture with a tailoring shop, set up in her house. With the help of 2 loans she bought second-hand sewing machines. She repaid the loans by producing jeans for those who sold her the machines. Her business has been increasing in infrastructure and today she has 7 sewing machines and 3 employees. During those seasons when there is an increase in sales she hires two other employees. Her dream is to separate her family living space from her business and production space in order to enjoy the peace she has wanted for so long. For this reason her long-term goal is to have a commercial store space where she will be able to exhibit and sell her designs. Her greatest challenge is approving clients who request long-term credit plans, as well as not having the capital funds hat she needs to complete finance her business. This is the reason why she requests a Kiva loan. It is the first loan she requests through Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo (Kiva Field Partner). With her loan she will purchase materials and sewing products to produce articles of clothing for clients who require longer term credit plans. Her clients live in the city of Barranquilla and Monteria and she needs to sustain this market, as it is already well-known to her and it is very profitable. As Mabel works to accomplish her dreams she strives to maintain a contribution margin of no less than 27% and a profit margin no less than 19%. She aspires to increase her profit margin with this new injection of funds to her working capital. She will be able to make her purchases in cash and in larger quantities than usual."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":344.99,"image":{"id":840547,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","use":"to

He lives with his partner and their three children who are from 3 to 7 years old in the town of Soledad, where he is dedicated to the production of food, a business with which he generates the main income for his home. Donnys, before he began his business, worked in the coal mines but his friend was killed and this situation impacted him so much that he abandoned the risky job that he performed. This is how he started his business selling peto (a drink based on cracked corn, cinnamon and milk), plaintains and chorizo. With his business, he has had a favorable change since he's built a customer base and has proven himself in the spot where he is located. His greatest disadvantage is his working capital which becomes insufficient to expand his market. His sales are cash sales and he manages little inventory because he buys from the neighborhood graneries on a daily basis and this does not allow him to give good discounts, by volume. His loan is the first loan that he's made with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation. With it, he will buy raw materials for the preparation of his products, such as cracked corn, cinnamon, milk, bananas, oil and chorizo to expand his sales and also buy chairs and table to achieve a more comfortable atmosphere for his customers. His dream is to adapt his home with better living conditions so every day he can continue contributing to the wellbeing of his children and

Adalberta has been preparing and selling Mexican street food for five years.\n\nShe decided to start this business because she needed to find a way to help her husband with the household expenses, improving their quality of life, and establishing a better financial situation.  In addition, she wanted to secure the future for herself and her husband by generating a good income.  The loan she is requesting will be invested in the purchase of more supplies such as oil, salt, tomatoes, chili peppers, potatoes, onions, meat, chicken, and corn so that she can continue preparing her delicious street food.  \n\nDo\u00f1a Ada (as she is better known in her community) says her goal is to grow her business even more.  She wants to build an establishment where she can open a restaurant and work toward a better future.  Ada wants to be well-stocked so that she can improve and increase her revenue.  \n\nShe says that all of her fellow group members are responsible people who fulfill their obligations.  They enjoy working so that they can move forward and overcome any difficulty.  For some time, they have been known for being consistent with their payments since they do not want to betray the trust that has been shown to them.  \n\nOn behalf of herself and her family, Do\u00f1a Ada would like to thank Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad and Kiva for changing her life.  She is now able to achieve a better lifestyle.  \n\nIn addition to Do\u00f1a Adalberta, the other members are as follows:  Victor, Santa C., Santa C. (there are two women with the same name), Mar\u00eda, Magali, Rubicela, Ubalda, and Ivett.

about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

\n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The start up capital is 50,000 soms. \r\n\r\nAlymkan plans to continue work at the retail food market until the fall season, when she\u2019ll be able to sell her own crops.

International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Hato Mayor is a fairly mountainous region where the principal industry is agriculture.\n\nAntonio has taken out four loans with field partner Esperanza International over the past two years. All of the loans have been paid back in full. He has used these loans to diversify the products that he sells. He is very excited about taking out this loan so that he can continue to grow his business.\n\nAntonio says that his favorite thing is to do business and his most important challenge is to establish his business.

In this way, she obtains good profits to meet her daily household expenses.  \r\n\r\nShe has applied to Edpyme Alternativa for a loan of 1000 nuevos soles to buy balanced feed, in order to continue fattening her sheep for sale. With the income she gets, she can pay off her loan, and improve her family's quality of life.\r\n\r\nNelida is a hard-working and responsible woman.  All she wants is for her children to succeed in life, and to improve her finances so that she can offer them the necessary education."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200.53,"image":{"id":843554,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy balanced feed for her animals.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Tambogrande - Piura","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2011-09-01T23:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Nelida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":68.95},{"due_date":"2011-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":71.25},{"due_date":"2011-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":74.55},{"due_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":74.4},{"due_date":"2011-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":80.9},{"due_date":"2012-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":81.3},{"due_date":"2012-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":83.4},{"due_date":"2012-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":88.3},{"due_date":"2012-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":89.75},{"due_date":"2012-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":92.4},{"due_date":"2012-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":96.25},{"due_date":"2012-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":98.55}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.86},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.72},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.95},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.9},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.34},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.49},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.27},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.11},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.66},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.65},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.09},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.96}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":52.58,"local_amount":140.2,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:46:17Z","rounded_local_amount":144.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232780107,"comment":null},{"amount":27.95,"local_amount":74.55,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:47:35Z","rounded_local_amount":76.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238584647,"comment":null},{"amount":27.9,"local_amount":74.4,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:41:48Z","rounded_local_amount":76.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244542822,"comment":null},{"amount":30.34,"local_amount":80.9,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-02T09:06:04Z","rounded_local_amount":83.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250753323,"comment":null},{"amount":30.49,"local_amount":81.3,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-01T09:00:53Z","rounded_local_amount":83.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257395345,"comment":null},{"amount":31.27,"local_amount":83.4,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:13:03Z","rounded_local_amount":86.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263290840,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-09-07T14:37:04Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}}]}
