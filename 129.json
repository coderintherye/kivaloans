Actualmente cuentan con poco inventario de este producto, es por eso que con el cr\u00e9dito comprar\u00e1 cajas de ajos, para as\u00ed seguir con el negocio y reforzar las ventas, Sonia espera que su negocio siempre se mantenga estable, y tambi\u00e9n trabajar\u00e1 duro para captar m\u00e1s clientes."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":200685,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"To buy boxes of garlic for resale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2008-09-08T22:20:24Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sonia Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-22T23:46:20Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":8000,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2008-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":888.88}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":47.22},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":47.22},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":47.22},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":47.22},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":47.22},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":47.22},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.22},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.22},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.24}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":48,"local_amount":903.53,"processed_date":"2008-10-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-28T07:05:23Z","rounded_local_amount":936.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":369287,"comment":"scheduled_repayment (late autopay posting for AFODENIC - Oct 23, 2008)"},{"amount":46.44,"local_amount":874.25,"processed_date":"2008-11-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-15T18:24:00Z","rounded_local_amount":906.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5281377,"comment":null},{"amount":47.22,"local_amount":888.89,"processed_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T09:54:46Z","rounded_local_amount":921.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9893204,"comment":null},{"amount":47.22,"local_amount":888.89,"processed_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T09:20:27Z","rounded_local_amount":921.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14816281,"comment":null},{"amount":47.22,"local_amount":888.89,"processed_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:22:14Z","rounded_local_amount":921.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20350988,"comment":null},{"amount":47.22,"local_amount":888.89,"processed_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:07:45Z","rounded_local_amount":921.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27038306,"comment":null},{"amount":47.22,"local_amount":888.89,"processed_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T09:44:19Z","rounded_local_amount":921.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35928609,"comment":null},{"amount":47.22,"local_amount":888.89,"processed_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:22:26Z","rounded_local_amount":921.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44383550,"comment":null},{"amount":47.24,"local_amount":888.88,"processed_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T16:28:27Z","rounded_local_amount":921.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52890042,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-09-08T23:46:20Z","paid_date":"2009-07-15T16:28:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":64147,"name":"Orlando Jos\u00e9","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"<p>Don Orlando, at his 40 years of age, has managed to have his own transportation business.

She has worked with livestock since she was very young, as her parents were livestock farmers.  She also buys and sells animals in the markets close to her home, which she has been doing ever since she got married.  She does this starting very early in the morning, when she leaves to take her animals to pasture in places far away so they can eat.  This is the activity that she likes the most because she can get out with her sheep and be with them all morning, and then return to her home to prepare food.  The difficult part is killing her sheep, because she is affectionate with all of them, but she has to do it so she can sell the meat, which she takes to the markets in a car that she managed to buy.  Ambrosia's three children are her reason and hope to improve, as they are studying in different colleges in nearby cities.  Now she is thinking of increasing her monthly income.

Dengan modal awal sebesar Rp. 500.000,- Purnomo bisa meraup keuntungan sekitar Rp. 60.000,- setiap hari dengan berjualan bakso dari jam 3 sore sampai jam 10 malam. Bersama istrinya yang selalu membantunya dalam menyiapkan & memasak makanan yang akan dijual, Purnomo memutuskan untuk meminjam ke DINARI melalui program KIVA sebesar Rp.3000.000,- yang akan digunakannya untuk menambah modal usahanya menjual bakso. Purnomo berharap dengan penambahan modal ini akan meningkatkan omset penjualannya sehingga keuntungan yang diperoleh pun akan bertambah besar. Hasil dari menjual bakso ini sangat mendukung ekonomi keluarganya dan juga bisa memenuhi kebutuhan sekolah anaknya yang duduk di bangku SD.","en":"Purnomo is in the business of selling meatball.

Until now, the family\u2019s main income still came from making bricks. The business has since expanded and she can now hire another worker.

She has been a part of this organization, using her first initial loan to invest in livestock.  After raising farm animals, she realized that the restaurant business would bring in and improve the family\u2019s income.  Since then, she has been borrowing subsequent loans in which she used to invest in a restaurant.  Presently, Ms. C. and her husband both run the family's restaurant while raising pigs and chickens at the same time.  The restaurant is known for providing good customer service and the number of people coming in to eat is growing every day.  Any leftover food from the restaurant is used to feed her livestock.  The family income has improved and since been stable from both businesses of raising farm animals and running a restaurant.  She is requesting a loan of 20.000.000d in which she plans to use to expand her restaurant and her farm.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by Lynn Nguyen, Kiva

She learned this business from her grandmother. With 8 years of experience, she enjoys the benefits of a good reputation and unequalled expertise in her area.  This brought her to establish an association to promote and defend the interests of local soap makers.\r\nWith the intent of growing her business, Mrs. Salamata Traor\u00e9 (president and founding member of the association of local soap makers of the city of Bougouni) decided to integrate the loan program from the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso, from whom she has requested her first loan. With this loan she plans to purchase 15 bags of caustic soda, 7 kilograms of shea butter, 20 liters of peanut oil and 15 bags of powdered soap.\r\nShe stocks her basic supplies on site at Bougouni and the soap production takes place in her home workshop. The products are mixed and poured into molds to create different colored soaps. She then sells them for cash or on credit. Her clients are generally shopkeepers, retailers and travelling salespeople.  This process (the purchase of supplies, production and sales) takes one month. \r\nShe foresees earning a profit of 50,000 FCFA per month which she will use to pay the interest on the loan and to contribute to her family expenses. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Allana Carlyle, Kiva

Their ambition is to possess, each of them, a freezer so as to better preserve the fresh fish and thus raise their profit margin. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":201014,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","use":"purchase of fresh fish, smoked fish, and food-grade ice","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Segou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14 -6","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2008-10-01T07:02:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Minata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rabiata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-15T23:18:50Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2008-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":183.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":183.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":183.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":183.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":183.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":183.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":183.33,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2008-11-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T02:44:25Z","rounded_local_amount":85060.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5350944,"comment":null},{"amount":183.33,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2008-12-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:28:58Z","rounded_local_amount":85060.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9974007,"comment":null},{"amount":183.33,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-01-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:28:26Z","rounded_local_amount":85060.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14889380,"comment":null},{"amount":183.33,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-02-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:13:19Z","rounded_local_amount":85060.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20440173,"comment":null},{"amount":183.33,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-03-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:09:31Z","rounded_local_amount":85060.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135541,"comment":null},{"amount":183.35,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:29:57Z","rounded_local_amount":85060.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033342,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-10-01T23:18:50Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T23:29:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":64303,"name":"Ortizer","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ortizer tiene 50 a\u00f1os, comparte su vida y su trabajo con su esposa.

Some of the fish is sold while it\u2019s fresh and some is smoked in a converted area on the family land in buildings specially designed for this job. The women take the smoked fish to Bamako (the capital of Mali) to be sold to resellers wholesale and for cash.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so she can use it while in process of paying back her loan \u00d0 a process called a sale and leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers ownership of the equipment to the client. The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that is allows clients.<\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":201070,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pharmacy","sector":"Health","use":"To purchase additional stock of medicine.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-09-15T18:20:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rabia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-29T22:05:54Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2008-10-30T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-11-16T08:57:36Z","rounded_local_amount":51771.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":374492,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2008-11-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:19:05Z","rounded_local_amount":51771.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347979,"comment":null},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2008-12-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-17T09:14:44Z","rounded_local_amount":51771.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970553,"comment":null},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-01-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:16:55Z","rounded_local_amount":51771.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886770,"comment":null},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:05:12Z","rounded_local_amount":51771.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436030,"comment":null},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:57:28Z","rounded_local_amount":51771.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130303,"comment":null},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:26:58Z","rounded_local_amount":51771.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027134,"comment":null},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:15:36Z","rounded_local_amount":51771.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613174,"comment":null},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:03:29Z","rounded_local_amount":51771.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010257,"comment":null},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:40:06Z","rounded_local_amount":51771.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232568,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-09-15T22:05:54Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T18:40:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":64328,"name":"Komi","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"N\u00e9e \u00e0 Tabligbo en 1982, monsieur S. est mari\u00e9 et p\u00e8re d\u2019un enfant.

I. is 36 years old and lives in a monogamous family with one child in the area of Attbougou, one of the outlying areas of the city of S\u00e9gou (the fourth administrative region of the republic of Mali). For social reasons, she left school early. After attempting many profit-generating businesses without success, her grandmother taught her the secret art of incense (traditional deodorant) production. She finished her apprenticeship and for the last 10 years has practiced this business. Today, she enjoys the benefits of a good reputation on a regional scale. She receives orders from all over the sub-region of West Africa (Burkina Faso, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire). To make a good quality incense with a pleasant smell requires magnonkis\u00e8ni, an exotic plant highly valued in West Africa, to be seasoned with perfumes and eau de Cologne for one month. To satisfy her growing clientele, she decided two years ago to join Soro Yiriwaso microfinance institution. After four joint group loans all which were properly repaid, she has requested her first individual loan. With this loan she plans to purchase 30 kg of incense seed (magnonkis\u00e8ni), 70 kg of K\u00e8ni (natural incense), 15 boxes of perfume (including eau de Cologne) and empty bottles. She gets her supplies mostly from the large market in the city of S\u00e9gou and sells her product for cash or on credit to a clientele composed mainly of women and men from Mali and neighboring countries. When weddings take place she is in very high demand due to the fact that her product is highly valued by newlyweds. She plans to earn a monthly income of 50,000 FCFA which will be used mainly to increase her business capital. Her dream is to build a new home. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Allana Carlyle, Kiva

She has worked in various businesses and knows a lot of people that she has been able to turn into clients for her new business selling shoes.  Many people have been interested in her products; she started in March 1998 by helping a neighbor sell shoes.  Cristina received a commission for each sale, and she slowly increased the number of clients.

At the beginning when she became part of this organization, she invested in doing small businesses.  After seeing a success with the loans she borrowed and the business experiences gained, she decided to invest into selling dog meat.  This is a specialty meat that a lot of people in her community really enjoy.  The business has bought an increase in Ms. H. family\u2019s income from 2.500.000 to 3.500.000d\/month.  Beside raising and selling dog meat, the family also raises hogs and chickens.  The family\u2019s income is growing and their lifestyles have improved.  She hopes to borrow more to invest into her business, thus improving the family\u2019s earnings and creating an educational opportunity for her children.  This next loan she is requesting an amount of 20.000.000d.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by Lynn Nguyen, Kiva

She and her husband had retired from civil services with a retirement check of 3.500.000d\/month.  Before becoming a part of this organization, her family ran a small auto repair shop out of their home.  Her husband was a soldier in the military, when he wasn\u2019t working he used his time to repair automobiles as a side job at the family\u2019s business.  After he had retired, the family had borrowed extra loans to invest in expanding his auto repair shop.  To meet the demands of the growing number of customers he presently have, they had to hire an additional worker to help.  Beside the retirement income, the family is able to bring in additional revenues from the shop and from raising pigs and chickens.  This next loan, she is hoping to borrow 20.000.000d to invest into buying machinery for the auto repair shop.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by Lynn Nguyen, Kiva

Currently, her family's income comes mainly from fishing. Everyday, she and her husband fish and sell to the fish retailers in the village, earning 100,000 to 150,000VND (about 6USD to 9USD) each day. Her family lives near Day river so fishing is very convenient. She has 2 children. They are all grown up with stable works and incomes, so the income from fishing is not only enough for daily expenses but also enough for them to save and invest in further business. This time, she would like to borrow 9,000,000VND (550USD) to purchase new net for fishing.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by Yen Thanh Pham, Kiva

Before that, her family faced many financial problems as she lived in the rural area and relied mainly on farming. After joining the Fund, she borrowed loans to invest in rearing pigs. After a period of time raising livestock and getting used to doing business, she and her husband decided to obtain more loans to buy rice and resell to retailers. She also milled the rice to sell to villagers. Currently, her family's monthly income from rearing pigs is about 3,000,000VND (about 187.50USD). Now, her family also buys peanuts and resells to retailers in town. Therefore, she would like to borrow 9,000,000VND (550USD) to purchase more rice and peanuts in the next season.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by Yen Thanh Pham, Kiva

When she first joined the fund, her family's income situation was difficult because their main income came from farming, and because her children were still young. After joining the fund, she borrowed money and invested in raising pigs. Her pig business produced very good results and stabilized their income. She also learned a lot of business know-hows from the women in the fund, and in 2007 she borrowed money to sell fruits\/vegetables. This business brings in average of 3 - 4 USD per day. For this next loan, she wishes to borrow additional 375 USD to invest in her fruits\/vegetables business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by Thu Ostrander, Kiva

As she lost her husband early, it worsened her family's economy, which was already in a difficult situation. In 1997, she joined the Fund and asked a loan to invest into breed pigs and poultry breeding. Besides her main occupation of daily breeding, Mrs. L\u00e1 also works as a daily worker for various businesses in the region. After 10 years with the Fund, and through her own efforts, she managed to grow up her child and their conditions of life have also gradually stabilized. Today, her family's income is 1.500.000\u0111 per month. She would like to borrow an additional 6.000.000\u0111 in order to set up a breeding facility and purchase pigs for raising.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by Minh Bui, Kiva

They generally live in traditional extended families in the Bozo district of the village of Sansanding, Markala sub-prefecture (fourth administrative region of the Republic of Mali).  United by social and economic ties, these women do commerce in smoked fish and market garden produce (cassava, potatoes, etc.)\r\n<p>In order to meet continuously growing customer needs, this group decided to join the loan program of the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso (discovered through one of the councilors of their village), through which the group is on its second solidarity loan (group loan).  All the preceding ones have been correctly repaid.  \r\nThe women intend to use this loan to buy a basket of smoked fish, two sacks of flour, four sacks of potatoes and \"atiek\u00e9\" cassava.  They get their supplies of smoked fish in Macina, one of the nearby prefectures from their village;  their market garden produce (potatoes and \"atiek\u00e9\") is from traveling vendors at the marketplaces of Sikasso and of Koutiala;  and as for the flour, it come from the grand marketplace in the city of S\u00e9gou.  The goods are sold out of the home in Sansanding and at the fairs in the villages of Markala, Dougabougou, Siango, and Seribala (cash or credit accepted) to customers essentially composed of women and children.  \r\n<p>They each hope to realize a monthly profit of 20,000 francs CFA that will serve to increase working capital funds, to cover the loan interest, and to provide for family needs.

United by ties of family and marriage, the women of this group decided to become members of the credit program of the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso, with whom they are on their second group loan, the former having been reimbursed without difficulty. <P>\r\n\r\nThey expect to buy with this loan: 3 dozen cups, 50 kg of sugar, 100 kg of hot peppers, 100 kg of onions, 4 baskets of soumbala (a condiment made from tree leaves), 25 kg of salt and 20 envelopes of other products. Whereas the cups are purchased in the big open-air market of Sikasso from wholesalers who handle that sort of merchandise, the other articles are bought right where they live, in the market of Farakala and in the surrounding villages. Then they sell these articles in the village, either out of their homes or door-to-door and in the weekly markets of Farakala and  the surrounding villages. The sales are mostly for cash and occasionally for credit. Their clientele is essentially made up of women. <P>\r\n\r\nThey hope to make a monthly profit of 15,000 FCFA, which will be used to make payments on the loan with the remainder invested in their businesses. Each of these women hopes to diversify her business and specialize in order to become a wholesaler. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":201507,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"purchase of various merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2008-10-01T07:02:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":825,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kamoko Kimbankoi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Koniba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tintio","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa Fousseny","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-16T11:53:22Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":375000,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T02:44:54Z","rounded_local_amount":63993.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5350949,"comment":null},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:30:08Z","rounded_local_amount":63993.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9974012,"comment":null},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:28:31Z","rounded_local_amount":63993.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14889385,"comment":null},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:13:44Z","rounded_local_amount":63993.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20440178,"comment":null},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:09:46Z","rounded_local_amount":63993.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135546,"comment":null},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:32:11Z","rounded_local_amount":63993.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033347,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-10-02T11:53:22Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T23:32:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":64492,"name":"Thi Chi\u00ean's Group","description":{"languages":["vi","en"],"texts":{"vi":"ch\u1ecb Nguy\u1ec5n th\u1ecb Chi\u1ebfn Ms 09040001 n\u0103m nay 38 tu\u1ed5i, v\u1ee3 ch\u1ed3ng ch\u1ecb sinh \u0111\u01b0\u1ee3c 3 con, c\u1ea3 3 con c\u1ee7a ch\u1ecb \u0111\u1ec1u \u0111ang \u0111i h\u1ecdc.

As she was still young, she took the courageous decision to quit her work. In the previous round, a loan of  2.006.000 VND together with their savings allowed the husband and wife to buy machines and open a small sewing workshop in their house. Additionally, she employs 8 workers to produce and deliver the merchandise in time to customers.  Although the work is hard, she is satisfied with the expansion of their business. She is all the happier, as she watches her two children grow up and achieve good school results. Today, she has already paid back the entire loan to the Fund and has registered to borrow another amount of 3.808.000 VND to invest further into the sewing workshop.\r\n\r\nThe members of her group

She lives with her husband and three children.  She is a young mother who strives to obtain daily sustenance for her family, and she does so doing farm work.  It was six years ago that she got married and began to share this work with her husband.  She grows potato, 'olluco' and some vegetables like onion.  She generally does this in the afternoons because in the mornings, she works at a government program called \"Wawawasi\".  There, her work is like that of a nanny- she offers her house and her time to take care of children of other women when they are working and don't have a place to leave their children.  During harvest time, her work load increases, but her efforts pay off because she is then able to take her products to the city to sell directly.

The professor is requesting his seventh loan, which he will use to finish the floor of his house.  He has used previous loans to build his house.  The construction of his home has been a challenge for him, but his own effort and the help of the loans have been fundamental in achieving his dream, since it would not have been possible on his salary.  He intends to continue to maintain his credit history, planning to continue improving the house.  He will take another loan for painting, and he expects that his home will be ready when children arrive.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Susan Sanford, Kiva
