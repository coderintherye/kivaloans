Not only because of economic needs, but also her responsibility to support the future of his child who just started first grade of high school.  Ni Wayan Suatri realized that her husband's farming income could not support all her family's need anymore.  So she wants to help her husband in bringing in extra income by starting a small pig farm in her home.  Despite only using simple pig pen, she could farm several fattening pigs to be later slaughtered.  From this small business profit, Ni Wayan Suatri realized significant benefit to her family's finances.  Each fattening pig, farmed for 6 months, she could earn $66 profit, and it could help pay her child's tuition and save the rest for her old days.  DINARI loans was used to buy more pigs and quality feeds so her product can satisfy customer and increase her profit.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Indonesian by Kresna Hartandi, Kiva Volunteer <\/p><\/b>\r\n\r\nDalam usia yang tidak bisa dibilang muda lagi yaitu 42 tahun tidak membuat Ni Wayan Suatri menjadi malas dalam bekerja.

Ni Wayan Suatri melihat bahwa penghasilan suaminya yang hanya seorang petani dengan penghasilan yang pas-pasan sudah tidak bisa lagi mencukupi keperluan keluarganya, sehingga timbul niatnya untuk membantu suaminya dalam memenuhi kebutuhan rumah tangganya yaitu dengan memelihara ternak babi di rumahnya. Walaupun kandangnya sederhana tapi itu dirasanya sudah cukup untuk bisa memelihara beberapa ekor babi khususnya babi penggemukan.\r\nDari usaha yang digelutinya ini Ni Wayan Suatri merasakan manfaat yang luar biasa terhadap kesejahteraan keluarganya, karena selain memiliki kesibukan setiap harinya, usahanya ini juga bisa memberikan keuntungan walaupun jumlahnya tidak begitu besar. Dari satu ekor babi penggemukan yang dipelihara selama enam bulan bisa menghasilkan keuntungan sekitar  Rp 600.000,- dan itu bisa dipergunakannya untuk membiayai sekolah anaknya dan sebagian kecil disimpannya untuk tabungan di hari tuanya kelak. Pinjaman  yang diperolehnya dari DINARI dipergunakannya untuk menambah jumlah babi penggemukan dan juga pengadaan pakan yang berkualitas supaya hasilnya bisa memuaskan dan meningkatkan

For Ni Ketut Sudarmi, tending to livestock is\r\nnot just about following a cultural practice. It benefits her family, especially because her efforts in this activity do not consume too much of her time and she is still able to take care of the home. \r\n\r\n<p> Working in this business requires perseverance and diligence because there are substantial challenges, including rising feed prices and problems with the health of the livestock.\r\n\r\n<p> With her children all grown up, it is only her, her husband and her two grandchildren. But this fact does not make her stop working hard because she wants to save for her and her husband's old age.\r\n\r\n<p> This activity of raising livestock began many years ago, but the methods were simple then. Consequently the end result was not very good; only enough to fulfill basic daily needs and allow for very modest savings. The pigs raised usually sold to businessmen who represent customers. Selling pigs to grow their income, they can get Rp. 600,000 up to Rp. 700,000 (USD equivalent $64 - $75). With assistance from DINARI in the form of capital (which was used to found this activity to begin with) Ni Ketut Sudarmi hopes that her dream of a successful business and a happy retirement can be achieved. \r\n\r\n   <p><b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Aarati, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\r\nSalah satu budaya kehidupan wanita pedesaan di Bali adalah memelihara ternak babi. Tetapi bagi Ni Ketut Sudarmi memelihara babi dilakukannya bukan hanya karena ikut-ikutan tetapi juga karena bisa memberikan hasil yang  baik untuk untuk keluarganya, karena usaha ini tidak terlalu menyita banyak waktu sehingga untuk mengurus rumah tangga tetap bisa dikerjakan. Yang diperlukan adalah keuletan dan kerajinan serta ketekunan dalam menjalankan usaha ini karena tantangannya juga cukup berat seperti harga pakan yang semakin meningkat ataupun gangguan kesehatan ternaknya. Tinggal bersama dengan suami dan dua orang cucunya karena anak-anaknya semua sudah berkeluarga  tidak membuatnya bermalas-malasan  saja, tetapi tetap bekerja keras supaya bisa menabung untuk masa tuanya nanti. \r\nUsah ternak babi ini sudah dijalaninya bertahun- tahun lamanya tetapi dengan cara yang masih sangat sederhana. Karena dikelola dengan sederhana hasil yang diperolehnyapun tidak begitu bagus, hanya cukup untuk memenuhi kebutuhan hidup sehari-hari dan untuk menabung juga hanya dalam jumlah kecil. Babi yang dipeliharanya biasanya dijual kepada pengusaha yang merupakan pelanggannya. Dari penjualan babi  untuk penggemukan keuntungan yang diperolehnya bisa mencapai Rp 600.000,- sampai dengan Rp 700.000,-. Dengan mendapat pendampingan dari DINARI baik berupa modal maupun pembinaan usaha Ni Ketut Sudarmi berharap apa yang diimpikannya yaitu usaha yang sukses dan masa tua yang bahagia, bisa diraihnya."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":123592,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase

SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing whereby SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women. Specifically, when a client needs working capital, SELFINA will purchase equipment from said client, extend a loan to her, and then lease the same equipment back to her \u2013 a process called a sale and leaseback arrangement. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; therefore, financial institutions do not consider Tanzanian women to be credit-worthy because they lack tangible assets that could serve as collateral. As a result, Tanzanian women with low income receive poor financial support and meager access to basic needs and services.

SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing whereby SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women. Specifically, when a client needs working capital, SELFINA will purchase equipment from said client, extend a loan to her, and then lease the same equipment back to her \u2013 a process called a sale and leaseback arrangement. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; therefore, financial institutions do not consider Tanzanian women to be credit-worthy because they lack tangible assets that could serve as collateral. As a result, Tanzanian women with low income receive poor financial support and meager access to basic needs and services. SELFINA thanks you for your

SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing whereby SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women. Specifically, when a client needs working capital, SELFINA will purchase equipment from said client, extend a loan to her, and then lease the same equipment back to her \u2013 a process called a sale and leaseback arrangement. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; therefore, financial institutions do not consider Tanzanian women to be credit-worthy because they lack tangible assets that could serve as collateral. As a result, Tanzanian women with low income receive poor financial support and meager access to basic needs and services. SELFINA thanks you for your support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":123685,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing whereby SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women. Specifically, when a client needs working capital, SELFINA will purchase equipment from said client, extend a loan to her, and then lease the same equipment back to her \u2013 a process called a sale and leaseback arrangement. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; therefore, financial institutions do not consider Tanzanian women to be credit-worthy because they lack tangible assets that could serve as collateral. As a result, Tanzanian women with low income receive poor financial support and meager access to basic needs and services. SELFINA thanks you for your support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":123692,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase additional stock in bulk.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbozi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.75 32.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-02-02T19:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rehema","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-02-16T21:12:58Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":46,"local_amount":50181.82,"processed_date":"2008-03-16T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-16T09:16:09Z","rounded_local_amount":53682,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159453,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":46,"local_amount":50181.82,"processed_date":"2008-04-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-16T09:16:09Z","rounded_local_amount":53682,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":184275,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":46,"local_amount":50181.82,"processed_date":"2008-05-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-16T09:16:09Z","rounded_local_amount":53682,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211878,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":46,"local_amount":50181.82,"processed_date":"2008-06-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-16T09:16:09Z","rounded_local_amount":53682,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":240047,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":46,"local_amount":50181.82,"processed_date":"2008-07-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-16T09:16:09Z","rounded_local_amount":53682,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":268958,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":45,"local_amount":49090.91,"processed_date":"2008-08-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-16T09:16:09Z","rounded_local_amount":52515,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":298074,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2008-02-02T21:12:58Z","paid_date":"2008-08-16T09:16:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":34677,"name":"Satnah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Satnah, 48, is married to D. and has 5 children.

Emelda M. is a 55-year-old widow with five children. Her children are between the ages of 18 and 34 years old. In 2000 Emelda established a restaurant, and now seeks a loan in order to purchase additional ingredients and kitchen utensils. Emelda explains that when you see a SELFINA entrepreneur whose business title is \"restaurant\" or \"caf\u00e9,\" you may have to adjust your mental image of what that is. A local restaurant or caf\u00e9 in Tanzania usually consists of a rough wooden table and some long, wooden benches, with the sky as the ceiling. Such places don\u2019t even appear in the Lonely Planet\u2019s budget guide, but if you\u2019re looking for a cheap and tasty meal, and someone to have a chat with, this is the place to be. The food is all local: rice, ugali (a hot, sticky dough, made from maize flour), plantain (a cooked, savory banana), all served with beans, vegetables, meat, and a variety of yummy sauces. Emelda thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\nAbout SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through leasing and leaseback facilities as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing whereby SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women. Specifically, when a client needs working capital, SELFINA will purchase equipment from said client, extend a loan to her, and then lease the same equipment back to her \u2013 a process called a sale and leaseback arrangement. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; therefore, financial institutions do not consider Tanzanian women to be credit-worthy because they lack tangible assets that could serve as collateral. As a result, Tanzanian women with low income receive poor financial support and meager access to basic needs and services. SELFINA thanks you for your

Dengan menyusuri lorong-lorong perumahan, pasar, gedung-gedung dengan tujuan untuk mendapatkan barang-barang bekas, lebih sering  Azis  membeli barang-barang bekas dari para ibu-ibu rumah tangga yang suka mengumpulkan barang yang sudah tidak terpakai lagi. Barang-barang bekas tersebut ditimbang dan dihargai sesuai dengan kualitas barang. Dana yang didapat dari DINARI digunakan sebagai modal untuk membeli barang bekas dari para pengepul.

That's how she got interested in and started selling these products. Currently she is in charge of other saleswomen. She receives additional commissions through the sales that they make as well. <p>\r\n\r\nNevertheless, she does not currently have enough merchandise, and what she has is out of season. That's why she is requesting a loan for $925 that she will be able to repay in six months. With this money, Mar\u00eda will be able to buy in-season merchandise to sell to her customers.

The little village is known for one particular thing: trout-fishing. The village has a big trout-farm with more than 50 big basins to grow the trout to an \u201ceatable-size\u201d. Along the main road, most of the population (which consists of only 20 families), have a small restaurant where you can eat grilled or fried trout. People traveling from L. to Ayacucho (over 8 hours) stop over on their way to rest a little and eat fish. Also, day-tourists from Ayacucho travel over one hour to eat the trout.\r\n<p>\r\nCurrently, the bank has completed its first loan-cycle after half a year of existence and all 15 female borrowers  paid back their loans punctually throughout the whole 6 month cycle. All the members are wearing their reward for paying back on time: a T-shirt from FINCA Peru!\r\n<p>\r\nThe members of the bank during their first half year with FINCA Peru, besides having learned to be responsible and punctual, have also learned to respect each other and to help other members of the group when they face some kind of difficulty. Another important fact is that the members of the \u201cboard of directors\u201d have learned how to manage their bank, assuming responsibilities they never assumed before in their life. \r\n<p>\r\nThe group was able to save over 1,800 soles (about 600 US$) in the first loan-cycle and will continue to save in the future; following the first loan-cycle most members have kept their savings within their community bank, with the hope of saving more.  For all members, the main use of the savings is for investing in their business or for the education of their children. The money is used to buy school uniforms, supplies, books and even to pay for entering primary or secondary school.  Another dream they have for their savings is to be able to make renovations to their small restaurants or kiosks.\r\n<p>\r\nThe loans range from 200 soles, 400 soles and up to 600 soles. The total of the loans adds up to 5,000 soles among the 15 members. Although many dedicate their time to the same business, every member has a different testimony\u2026.. As is the case of Bertha T. P.. Bertha has 2 businesses: a small grocery-store and the trout-restaurant she has run for over 10 years. But, with her 200 soles loan she will buy new supplies such as soft-drinks, beer, sweets and toilet paper for her grocery-store. When asked about her future, she says that everything she earns and saves is for the education of her children so they can be professionals and keep studying.\r\n<p>\r\nJacinta H.

Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed \u2018un-creditworthy\u2019 by financial institutions due to a lack of tangible collateral assets. Poor financial support results in poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.\r\n\r\n<P>SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women. When a client needs working capital, SELFINA buys equipment from the said client, extends a loan to her, then leases back the same equipment \u2013 a process called a \u2018sale and leaseback arrangement\u2019."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":124142,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Hardware","sector":"Retail","use":"To

They work really hard. Suati is a homemaker while her husband is a farm worker working on someone else's farm with unstable income everyday. Because of the large family expenses, Suati is finding a way to be more productive to help the family makes ends meet. Just as many other women do,  Suati finally chose to raise hogs. However Suati does not have enogh money to buy the two sows she wants. Finally Suati is getting the loan from Dinari in the amount of 300,000 IDR (Translator's note: 1US$ fluctuates between 9,000-9,500 IDR). The loan is going to be used for buying sows and animal feed.  She hopes that the sows will deliver piglets that in turn can be resold. Suati is very happy to run the business and very confident that she will be getting enough profit to support her children's education to the highest possible level.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Arliadi Mahadi, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nNi Wayan Suati dan I Kadek Polos adalah sepasang suami istri dengan tiga orang anak, mereka  sangat rajin bekerja. Suati adalah seorang  ibu rumah tangga sedangkan suaminya bekerja sebagai petani yang hanya bisa mengarap milik orang lain dengan upah yang tidak pasti setiap hari. Mengingat akan besarnya kebutuhan hidup setiap hari yang harus dikeluarkan oleh  Suati  maka Suati mencari jalan keluar bagaimana caranya agar Suati pun memiliki usaha yang produktif yang bisa mendatangkan penghasilan bagi keluarganya. Akhirnya Suati memilih untuk  memelihara babi seperti kebanyakan ibu \u2013ibu yang lain. Tetapi Suati tidak memiliki modal yang cukup untuk membeli 2 induk ekor induk babi, akhirnya Suati mendapatkan modal dari Dinari sebesar Rp 3.000.000.- Dana pinjaman itu dipergunakan untuk membeli induk babi dan pakan. Dengan membeli induk babi, Suati berharap induk babinya bisa segera mempunyai anak sehingga bisa dijual kembali.   Suati sangat senang sekali dan menjalankan usaha ini dengan penuh keyakinan bahwa Suati akan mendapatkan keuntungan yang besar dari hasil usahanya ini dan berharap anak \u2013anaknya tetap bisa sekolah sampai tingkat tinggi."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":125101,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy sows and animal feed","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2008-02-08T03:50:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Wayan Suati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-02-22T07:51:52Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":3000000,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2009-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2009-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":250000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.13}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":30,"local_amount":257142.86,"processed_date":"2008-03-22T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:38:30Z","rounded_local_amount":276497.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":163676,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":30,"local_amount":257142.86,"processed_date":"2008-04-22T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:39:33Z","rounded_local_amount":276497.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188645,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":30,"local_amount":257142.86,"processed_date":"2008-05-22T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:41:13Z","rounded_local_amount":276497.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216582,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":30,"local_amount":257142.86,"processed_date":"2008-06-22T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:42:16Z","rounded_local_amount":276497.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":245505,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":30,"local_amount":257142.86,"processed_date":"2008-07-22T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:43:07Z","rounded_local_amount":276497.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":273969,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":30,"local_amount":257142.86,"processed_date":"2008-08-22T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:44:02Z","rounded_local_amount":276497.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":303469,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":30,"local_amount":257142.86,"processed_date":"2008-09-22T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-29T07:21:03Z","rounded_local_amount":276497.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":334293,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":24,"local_amount":205714.29,"processed_date":"2008-10-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-11-16T08:41:44Z","rounded_local_amount":221198.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":368733,"comment":"scheduled_repayment (late autopay posting for DINARI Foundation -

Finally with loan from Dinari for 3,000,000 IDR (Translator's note: 1USD ranges between 9,000-9,500.00 IDR) Ni Kadek Artini could purchase two piglets, one for breeding and another one for meat producing. Ni Kadek Artini wishes that her hog farming can grow without further buying piglets from other farmers or insemination. Good boar typically is 8 or 10 month old. An old enough boar can be loaned to breed other farmers' sow. Each week 3 to 5 people loan Ni Kadek Artini's boar for 50,000 IDR. Each week the boar can produce 150,000 IRD to 250,000 IDR. Ni Kadek Artini maintains the quality of feed given to her boar. Beside polard and concentrate, Ni Kadek Artini also feed the boar with free range chicken eggs to maintain the boar's condition to breed a high quality piglets. The meat producing side costs 500,000 IDR for animal feed, giving her a gross of 900,000 IDR. Hence the total income from breeding and meat producing is 1,000,000 to 1,500,000 IDR per month\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Arliadi Mahadi, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nDari dulu Ni Kadek Artini berkeinginan untuk pelihara pejantan dan penggemukan. Akhirnya dengan modal yang didapat dari Dinari sebesar                   Rp. 3.000.000.- Ni Kadek Artini bisa membeli 2 bibit babi yang dipakai untuk pejantan dan yang satu lagi dipakai untuk penggemukan. Ni Kadek Artini berkeinginan supaya usaha ternak babinya bisa berkembang biak tanpa harus membeli bibit di peternak lain atau memakai kawin suntik. Pejantan yang bagus berumur 8 atau 10 bulan. Pejantan yang sudah cukup umur, bisa disewakan untuk mengawini induk peternak lainnya. Setiap satu minggu, 3 s\/d 5 orang yang menyewa pejantan milik Ni Kadek Artini dengan ongkos Rp. 50.000.- sekali kawin. Dalam satu minggu, penghasilan yang didapat dari pejantan bisa mencapai Rp.150,000,- s\/d Rp.250,000,-. Ni Kadek Artini menjaga sekali mutu makanan yang diberi untuk pejantannya. Selain dedak padi dan konsentrat, Ni Kadek Artini juga memberi  telur ayam kampung supaya kondisinya tetap kuat dan sehat sehingga mampu menghasilkan keturunan yang berkwalitas. Sedangkan untuk penggemukan sampai panen menghabiskan pakan Rp.500.000.- dengan hasil kotor Rp. 900.000.- . Jadi keuntungan bersih pejantan dan penggemukan per bulan rata-rata Rp.1.000,000,- s\/d

a woman to excel in the hardware business for 16 years, she needs determination and hard work, just like B.

She has been running a hardware shop selling building materials like iron bars, cement, and wall paints in Kazo town for 16 years with the help of money from loans, and now her monthly sale is $355.

Her dream is to build a house, raise more capital, and start a new business with a motorcycle taxi."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":125244,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"Lidia requests a loan of 3000 soles (3 soles = $1), which she will invest in buying rice, sugar, noodles, oil, milk, eggs, firewood, and different medicines.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2008-02-06T15:20:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lidia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-02-20T21:25:07Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2008-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2008-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2008-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2008-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2008-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":170.83},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":170.83},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":170.83},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":170.83},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":170.83},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":170.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":171,"local_amount":500.49,"processed_date":"2008-03-20T10:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-20T09:15:20Z","rounded_local_amount":505.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":162231,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":171,"local_amount":500.49,"processed_date":"2008-04-20T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-20T09:15:20Z","rounded_local_amount":505.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":187417,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":171,"local_amount":500.49,"processed_date":"2008-05-20T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-20T09:15:20Z","rounded_local_amount":505.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":215364,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":171,"local_amount":500.49,"processed_date":"2008-06-20T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-20T09:15:20Z","rounded_local_amount":505.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244146,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":171,"local_amount":500.49,"processed_date":"2008-07-20T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-20T09:15:20Z","rounded_local_amount":505.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":272496,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":170,"local_amount":497.56,"processed_date":"2008-08-20T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-20T09:15:20Z","rounded_local_amount":502.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301772,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2008-02-06T21:25:07Z","paid_date":"2008-08-20T09:15:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":35030,"name":"Ijah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ijah is a 40-year-old widow.

She started her business with small savings that she obtained from her previous business which was washing and ironing clothes by request.  It is necessary to emphasize that Mrs. Rosa is a single mother and she faces the necessity of taking care of her little son and a small granddaughter of school age.  Her difficult seconomic situation puts her in a place where she works with a lot of strength and desire to better her life.  Also it is necessary to emphasize that the business of Mrs. Rosa needs to improve its infrastructure because it does not have a roof she only uses leaves to cover her place and furthermore she needs to acquire firewood and the dough to produce the tortillas.  For this reason she went to Ceprodel so that she could benefit from credits that allow her to better her business and in this manner take her son and granddaughter out of the neighborhood they inhabit.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by Fallon Shields, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n<div align='justify'> \r\nLa elaboraci\u00f3n y venta de tortillas es el negocio a que se dedica la se\u00f1ora Rosa In\u00e9s J. desde hace 25 a\u00f1os en su humilde casa de habitaci\u00f3n en el municipio de El Sauce de Le\u00f3n en Nicaragua.
