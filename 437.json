This has been very important for her, since because she has a business, the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation has granted her 2 loans, helping her to expand her working capital.

Editha has been farming for fifteen years already. She recently started raising hogs to have an extra source of income. She says she wants to buy more piglets to add to her livestock.\r\n\r\nEditha joined CEVI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Editha has successfully repaid a previous loan from CEVI. Editha is requesting a new loan of 12,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional seeds and fertilizers and also feed for the pigs. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Editha from CEVI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to make improvements to their house. \r\n\r\nAbout CEVI:\r\n\r\nCommunity Economic Ventures, Inc (CEVI) has increased its portfolio significantly over the recent years.

She thanks you for your support. \r\n\r\nIn the Kathmandu Valley, the small grocery stores, called pasals, are an important part of the local economy. Fresh produce, milk, and staples such as rice, lentils, and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home. Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margins. By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability.  While a typical pasal might be no more than 100 sq. feet, they are always full of bargaining customers, incoming produce, and shrewd businesswomen.\r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007. Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women.  In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.

She is married and has 3 children between the ages of 24 and 18. In 2008, she established a business raising cows. Working 7 days a week and 5 hours a day, she supports her family. She has already received and successfully repaid 5 loans from Patan BPW and used her most recent to buy a young dairy cow. In the future, Sumitra plans to uplift the economic conditions of her family. She thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\nDairy cows are an important source of nutrition and income in Nepal. Cows are never raised for beef, but for their milk from which curd (duy) and fresh cheese (paneer) are made. Jersey cows are the preferred breed for milking. On average, a dairy cow in Nepal will produce about 10 liters of milk each day. In the local market, a liter of milk sells for about USD $0.50. In addition to producing milk, cows provide dung that is used in home construction, as fuel for fires, and can be captured in methane storage tanks. The purchase of a dairy cow, made possible through a Kiva loan, is an investment that will repay itself many times over.\r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007. Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women.  In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.

She lives very close to a soccer stadium, around which there are residential as well as commercial neighborhoods full of stores and businesses that represent great competition for her, but also potential customers. If the customers don't find what they're looking for, they can always come in to Nuris' store, where she provides great customer service, including payment plans for her regular customers. \r\n\r\nNuris' customers are her neighbors, family members and people at large. She pays special attention to those who have been referred to her by her regulars, which ensures good cash flow. Nuri has been involved with Kiva partner Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo for three years, which has helped her stock her business. Her relationship with FMSD has also helped her to respond quickly to her customers' needs, and has allowed her to make improvements to her home and provide employment for someone else. \r\n\r\nNuris' dream is to turn her little business into a serious store, full of the exclusive items her customers deserve. She will use this loan to buy wholesale items such as clothes, shoes, and cosmetics in preparation for the second half of the year, the more active commercial season. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Violeta Rubiani, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":576639,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Buying clothes, shoes, and cosmetics to sell in her store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2010-07-29T06:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nuris Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1300000,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":96592},{"due_date":"2010-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":100368},{"due_date":"2010-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":102041},{"due_date":"2010-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":103742},{"due_date":"2011-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":105471},{"due_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":107229},{"due_date":"2011-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":109016},{"due_date":"2011-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":110833},{"due_date":"2011-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":112680},{"due_date":"2011-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":114558},{"due_date":"2011-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":116467},{"due_date":"2011-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":121003}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.87},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.97},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.91},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.86},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.82},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.8},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.8},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.81},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.84},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.88},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.96},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.48}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":53.87,"local_amount":96592,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:08:02Z","rounded_local_amount":99705.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172117149,"comment":null},{"amount":55.97,"local_amount":100368,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:01:33Z","rounded_local_amount":103603.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177411018,"comment":null},{"amount":56.91,"local_amount":102041,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:09:06Z","rounded_local_amount":105330.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182550672,"comment":null},{"amount":57.86,"local_amount":103742,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:14:01Z","rounded_local_amount":107085.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188688278,"comment":null},{"amount":58.82,"local_amount":105471,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:38:51Z","rounded_local_amount":108870.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191427507,"comment":null},{"amount":59.8,"local_amount":107229,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-16T08:40:03Z","rounded_local_amount":110685.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196000920,"comment":null},{"amount":122.61,"local_amount":219849,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:09:25Z","rounded_local_amount":226935.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201288928,"comment":null},{"amount":126.73,"local_amount":227238,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:17:39Z","rounded_local_amount":234562.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211230093,"comment":null},{"amount":64.95,"local_amount":116467,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:50:24Z","rounded_local_amount":120221.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221673206,"comment":null},{"amount":67.48,"local_amount":121003,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:01:11Z","rounded_local_amount":124903.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227319776,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-07-29T20:16:21Z","paid_date":"2011-09-17T08:01:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":219078,"name":"Ly","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"In Angkonh village, Takeo province, lives a person named Mr. Ly S., who was born in 1977.

P. is a 46-year old married woman who supports her family by operating 3 business ventures:  farming, a general store and pig fattening. She lives in Hacienda Panidlan, Barangay Payao, Binalbagan, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 1998 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her farming, general store and pig fattening businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average income of 3,000 PHP. \r\n\r\nDelia is now borrowing 12,000 PHP so that she can have additional working capital for her farming activities and her general store.  This will be her 13th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 12,000 PHP, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Delia aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nDelia is shown in the picture with her sugarcane crop in the background.\r\n\r\n<b> About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

C. is a 33-year-old married woman who supports her family by operating a general store  business.  She lives in Sitio Balisong, Brgy Libacao, Himamaylan City, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2007 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. \r\n\r\nBy working hard in her  general store, Melanie is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of 7000. Melanie is now borrowing PHP 15,000 so that she can sustainably expand her general store business .  This will be her 6th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 13,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Melanie aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the  'Dungganon' way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She earns her living by operating 3 business ventures:  weaving, a general store, and pig fattening businesses. Her 45-year-old husband, Dionisio R., works as a Sugar Mill employee to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.  She has 6 children who are 23 to  41 years old. \r\n\r\nAdelina joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 7 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Adelina has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 12,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 5,500, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 8th loan, she is borrowing PHP 16,000, which she intends to use to expand her business so that she can continue to save up for their future, increase the family's household income, and have a comfortable life. Adelina R. is a 'Dungganon' woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

This will be her 14th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 16000, which she paid off well within its term was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom.

She is 33 and married. She has three sons and all of them are in school. Three years ago, with the initial investment of 5000 soms, Odinahon and her husband began to breed livestock and sell it after fattening for a higher price. In this way, they make 4,000 soms per month. With money received from the loan, Odinahon wants to purchase sheep for breeding. In the future, she is planning to increase the number of livestock and save money to be able to pay for her children\u2019s education at the university.\r\n\r\nGulnara J. is the treasurer of the group. She is 35 and married. She has three daughters and a son and all of them study at school. Seven years ago, with the initial investment of 10,000 soms, Gulnara and her husband started to breed cattle. By selling the cattle after fattening, they make 4,000 soms per month.  Gulnara applied for the loan because she wants to purchase a bull and resell it at a higher price after fattening. \r\n\r\nAlmazbek A., 29, is married. He has two sons and a daughter and all of them are preschool age (In Kyrgyzstan, children go to school when they are seven). Four years ago, with the initial investment of 10,000 soms, Almazbek rented a place and started to sell convenience goods. He makes 4,000 soms per month.  With the money received from the loan, he wants to purchase foodstuffs to increase the turnover of his business. In the future, Almazbek plans to expand his business and wants to build a big house.\r\n\r\nUlpat K., 44, is married. She has two daughters and two sons. The older daughter and her Dad went to work in Russia to make some money, and the other children are students.  Six years ago, with the initial investment of 10,000 soms, Ulpat rented a place and started to sell convenience goods. She makes 8,000 soms per month. That profit made it possible for her to repair her house and pay for her children\u2019s education. Ulpat also breeds livestock and now the price for livestock is low. So with money received from the loan, she wants to purchase sheep for breeding. \r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\n This loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

After the break up she decided to take on the responsibilities for her child, so she opened a beauty salon in 2006 after having 6 years of experience as a hairdresser. As she said, she always tries to offer all the new cuts and models to meet the requests of her customers and to attract more clients to her shop.\r\n\r\nToday, she is asking to borrow $1,200 to expand her business by adding new services and purchasing more equipment and beauty supplies.\r\n\r\nNote: Based on the political and social challenges of Lebanon, personally identifiable attributes of this entrepreneur have been altered to protect her (i.e., blacking out portions of the entrepreneur in her picture, not indicating her name and location, etc.).  Ameen s.a.l. appreciates Kiva lenders' understanding of these challenges and encourages lenders to continue their support of Lebanon's borrowers.\r\n\r\n<b>About Ameen:<b\/>\r\nAmeen s.a.l. has been a major player in the Lebanese Microfinance sector since 1999. Originally a micro-credit program created by CHF International, Ameen evolved to become Ameen s.a.l. in 2003, a Lebanese services company. In 2007, Ameen s.a.l. registered with the Central Bank of Lebanon to become the first Lebanese financial institution specializing in microfinance.\r\n\r\nAt Ameen s.a.l. we pledge to provide financial services to the largest number of micro and small entrepreneurs and to the working poor, to help them develop their businesses and improve their incomes.\r\n\r\nAmeen has been able to use its interest-free loans from Kiva to offer lower-interest loans with faster disbursement for their micro-loan borrowers.

He has eight years of experience working as a farmer. In 2007, he started cultivating his land independently and working on his own. The nature of the ground allows him to grow different varieties of vegetables and fruits according to the different seasons in Lebanon. His business has grown and he has hired a part time worker to help him. He is requesting a loan of $1000 from Kiva partner Ameen s.a.l. to purchase needed supplies for his agricultural work. He estimates that his profit has the potential to increase by 18% after taking the loan. \r\n\r\nNote: Based on the political and social challenges of Lebanon, personally identifiable attributes of this entrepreneur have been altered to protect him or her (i.e., blacking out portions of the entrepreneur in his\/her picture, not indicating his\/her name and location, etc.). Ameen s.a.l. appreciates Kiva lenders' understanding of these challenges and encourages lenders to continue their support for Lebanon's borrowers.\r\n\r\nAbout Ameen:\r\nAmeen s.a.l. has been a major player in the Lebanese microfinance sector since 1999. Originally, a micro-credit program created by CHF International, in 2003 Ameen evolved to become Ameen s.a.l., a Lebanese services company. In 2007, Ameen s.a.l. registered with the Central Bank of Lebanon to become the first Lebanese financial institution specialized in microfinance.\r\n\r\nAt Ameen s.a.l. we pledge to provide financial services to the largest number of micro and small entrepreneurs and to the working poor, to help them develop their businesses and improve their incomes.\r\n\r\nAmeen has been able to use its interest-free loans from Kiva to offer lower-interest loans with faster disbursement to their micro-loan borrowers. Since its inception, Ameen has provided high-quality financial services to over 41,000 borrowers and disbursed over 81,000 loans totaling $115 million.

O. O. is a young married man who does not have any children yet. His business is located in Nyalenda, a very busy market in Kisumu. It is well known by the name of \"Ring Road Restaurant\". He serves food and drinks to the local people. Elderly men from an area in Kisumu called Nyamasaria form most of his clientele. He describes himself as sociable, charismatic and optimistic.\r\n\r\nRichard has been in his business for the last two years now and has been able to employ four people.

Now he has a larger business in both infrastructure and client\u00e8le, and he has diversified his offerings, selling medicinal drugs.  Alinnson has 2 employees and he sustains his business, despite fierce competition, with lower prices than competitors, because he buys at wholesale and knows where to purchase. Alinnson works from 8:00am until 9:00pm every day. Now his customers know his schedule and they seek him out and refer him to others.\r\n\r\nAlinnson has received 8 loans and this loan request from Kiva will be his 9th.

A. tiene 3 hijos en las edades de 19 a 25 a\u00f1os y vive en el barrio el Carmen de la ciudad de Barranquilla. Ella inici\u00f3 su negocio  de preparaci\u00f3n y venta de alimentos, hace alrededor de 15 a\u00f1os cuando, como dice ella,  se le dio por vender cervezas comidas r\u00e1pidas y sancochos los fines de semana. Gradualmente su clientela creci\u00f3 y con cada pr\u00e9stamo realizado por la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, organizaci\u00f3n en la que tiene 10 a\u00f1os de estar vinculada, ha logrado vender diariamente almuerzos, que es su mayor mercado y ha dejado las comidas r\u00e1pidas para los fines de semanas, porque  las familias aumentan sus compras en  los deliciosos perros calientes, sanduches, hamburguesas,  porque dejan de cocinar  los fines de semanas para descansar. Tambi\u00e9n  desde que recibi\u00f3 sus cr\u00e9ditos con esta organizaci\u00f3n,  ha dejado de prestar dinero a intereses muy altos y obtiene mayor utilidad con la venta de sus productos, porque comprar al por mayor le significa ahorro en el precio de los materias primas e insumos,  que ella requiere para realizar su trabajo.\nSu meta siguiente y tambi\u00e9n su mayor desaf\u00edo es comprar su casa, para eso se prepara ahorrando la cuota inicial,  para acceder al megaproyecto institucional Villas de San Pablo en Barranquilla, donde la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo,  juega un papel importante en la construcci\u00f3n de comunidades. Otra de sus metas es que su hijo termine sus estudios, porque sue\u00f1a con que \u00e9l sea exitoso. \nOlga S. \u00faltimamente ha presentado problemas con su estufa, porque se encuentra en mal estado y demora los tiempos de cocci\u00f3n, adem\u00e1s de agotarse m\u00e1s,  por eso, para ella obtener un credikiva es la mejor soluci\u00f3n, con \u00e9l comprar\u00e1  una estufa semiindustrial utensilios y el resto lo invertir\u00e1  en  materia prima e insumos\n\n","en":"Olga S. A. has 3 children between the ages of 19 and 25 and she lives in the neighborhood of el Carmen in the city of Barranquilla. She began her food service business about 15 years ago when, as she says, she began to sell beer and fast foods and soups during the weekends. Gradually her clientele grew and with each loan from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, an organization she's been involved with for 10 years, she's managed to sell lunch daily, which is her biggest market. She's left the fast foods for the weekends because families increase their purchases with delicious hot dogs, sandwiches, and hamburgers because they relax on weekends instead of cooking. Since she's received the loans from this organization she's stopped borrowing money with high interest rates and her sales have improved because buying wholesale has saved her money on primary materials that she needs to do her work. \r\n\r\nHer next goal and also her biggest challenge is buying her house. For this purpose she's preparing to save the initial cost to gain access to the institutional mega project Villas de San Pablo en Barranquilla, where the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo plays an important role in the construction of communities. Another of her goals is that her son finishes his studies because she dreams that he'll be successful. Olga S. has recently had problems with her stove because it's in bad condition and it delays cooking times, in addition to just being worn out. This is why, for her,  obtaining a loan from Kiva is the best solution. With the loan she'll buy a semi-industrial stove and utensils, and with the rest she'll invest in primary materials and ingredients. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kate Richardson, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":576954,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase of semi-industrial stove and utensils; the rest will be used to buy primary materials and ingredients ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2010-07-29T16:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Olga Del Socorro","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":74857},{"due_date":"2010-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":77216},{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":78503},{"due_date":"2010-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":79811},{"due_date":"2011-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":81141},{"due_date":"2011-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":82494},{"due_date":"2011-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":83869},{"due_date":"2011-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":85267},{"due_date":"2011-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":86688},{"due_date":"2011-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":88132},{"due_date":"2011-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":89601},{"due_date":"2011-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":92421}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.17},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.47},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.18},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.89},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.63},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.37},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.13},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.9},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.68},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.47},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.28},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":41.17,"local_amount":74857,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:08:07Z","rounded_local_amount":75998.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172117151,"comment":null},{"amount":42.47,"local_amount":77216,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:01:00Z","rounded_local_amount":78393.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177411020,"comment":null},{"amount":43.18,"local_amount":78503,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:08:32Z","rounded_local_amount":79699.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182550674,"comment":null},{"amount":43.89,"local_amount":79811,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:14:15Z","rounded_local_amount":81027.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188688280,"comment":null},{"amount":44.63,"local_amount":81141,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:39:14Z","rounded_local_amount":82378,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191427509,"comment":null},{"amount":45.37,"local_amount":82494,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-16T08:40:21Z","rounded_local_amount":83751.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196000922,"comment":null},{"amount":46.13,"local_amount":83869,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:08:17Z","rounded_local_amount":85147.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201288929,"comment":null},{"amount":46.9,"local_amount":85267,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:04:59Z","rounded_local_amount":86566.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206157083,"comment":null},{"amount":47.68,"local_amount":86688,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:18:04Z","rounded_local_amount":88009.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211230095,"comment":null},{"amount":148.58,"local_amount":270154,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:49:11Z","rounded_local_amount":274272.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221673208,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-07-29T19:42:09Z","paid_date":"2011-08-15T08:49:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":219331,"name":"Oscar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"For the past ten years, Oscar has been in the cleaning business for commercial and residential buildings. Three years ago, with the help of his wife, he decided to start his own business. He now provides maintenance, upkeep, and car-wash services to the buildings where he works. \r\n\r\nOscar loves being his own boss because it has given him a new freedom. He is passionate about the business and is able to send his daughters to university. He is confident that starting his own business has created a better future for his family. \r\n\r\nOscar\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/lend\/121802\" target=\"_blank\">first loan<\/a> with ACCION USA allowed him to buy equipment for his new car-wash service. Now he will use his second loan to buy lists of clients and expand his advertising capabilities. This will allow him to reach out to clients in the greater Miami area.\r\n\r\nWith a great attitude and many client referrals, Oscar is happy to report that his business is constantly growing. He strives to provide excellent services to his clients, which they expect of him. Oscar is grateful for ACCION USA\u2019s confidence in his business and is looking forward to taking on new residential and commercial buildings as customers.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About U.S. Microfinance and ACCION USA:<\/b>\r\nHave you ever thought about how the cute new caf\u00e9 on your corner or the salon you frequent every month got the financial resources to start their business? Chances are, they drummed up support from their friends and family, dipped into their personal savings, used a high-interest credit card, or all of the above. An estimated ten million small businesses in the U.S. face difficulty obtaining loans from traditional banks, even prior to the current \u201ccredit crisis\u201d. Microfinance institutions, like ACCION USA, support these \u201cunbanked\u201d small businesses by giving them access to fairly-priced capital and business education.\r\n\r\nSmall businesses also help stabilize low- to moderate-income neighborhoods and rebuild our economy through income growth and job creation. Self-employment provides workers with a way to increase their incomes, support their families, and strengthen their communities. As unemployment rises in the U.S., more and more people are turning to self-employment and start-up enterprises as a way to take control of their economic futures and provide employment opportunities in their communities. The need for support of small businesses in the U.S. is great, and it is one that ACCION USA has been striving to meet since 1991.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":7800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":7800,"image":{"id":575709,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"To buy

He is now requesting a loan from Kiva that he will invest in the purchase of raw materials and supplies to make and repair gold and silver jewelry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":576964,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Jewelry","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase raw materials and supplies to make and repair gold and silver jewelry","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2010-07-29T16:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":825,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luis Hernan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1500000,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":108531},{"due_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":114444},{"due_date":"2010-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":116638},{"due_date":"2010-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":118873},{"due_date":"2010-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":121152},{"due_date":"2011-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":123474},{"due_date":"2011-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":125840},{"due_date":"2011-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":128252},{"due_date":"2011-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":130710},{"due_date":"2011-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":133216},{"due_date":"2011-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":135769},{"due_date":"2011-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":143101}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.69},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.95},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.15},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.38},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.63},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.91},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.21},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.54},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.89},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.27},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.71}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":59.69,"local_amount":108531,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:17:22Z","rounded_local_amount":110185.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166850376,"comment":null},{"amount":62.95,"local_amount":114444,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:08:10Z","rounded_local_amount":116188.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172117152,"comment":null},{"amount":64.15,"local_amount":116638,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:01:08Z","rounded_local_amount":118416.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177411021,"comment":null},{"amount":65.38,"local_amount":118873,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:08:40Z","rounded_local_amount":120685.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182550675,"comment":null},{"amount":66.63,"local_amount":121152,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:14:21Z","rounded_local_amount":122998.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188688281,"comment":null},{"amount":67.91,"local_amount":123474,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T23:40:17Z","rounded_local_amount":125356.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191427510,"comment":null},{"amount":69.21,"local_amount":125840,"processed_date":"2011-02-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-16T08:40:01Z","rounded_local_amount":127758.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196000923,"comment":null},{"amount":70.54,"local_amount":128252,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:08:29Z","rounded_local_amount":130207.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201288930,"comment":null},{"amount":71.89,"local_amount":130710,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:05:28Z","rounded_local_amount":132702.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206157084,"comment":null},{"amount":226.65,"local_amount":412086,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:18:16Z","rounded_local_amount":418368.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211230096,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-07-30T18:58:49Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T11:18:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":219335,"name":"G.s.

A. is a married father of two who currently lives in Chuaku, Belo-Cameroon. A. is currently requesting a third loan from GHAPE. He has been with GHAPE since 2008, and he has demonstrated a creditworthy character exemplified by his repayments, consistent attendance at meetings, and support of his borrowing group.  \r\n<p>\r\nWith this latest loan, A. is hoping to continue the business practices supported by his prior loans. He has requested 340,000 XAF in order to purchase seven female goats for 100,000 XAF, 150 chicks for 150,000 XAF, fowl feed for 50,000 XAF, and seedlings for 40,000 XAF. He believes that this business will succeed, because there is a ready market for his product. He hopes to use the profits from his business to build his home, to purchase more land, and to pay his children's school fees. He hopes to improve his children's living conditions in order to avoid the hardships that he has dealt with throughout his life-- struggles such as a lack of education, illnesses, and unemployment.  \r\n<p>\r\nA.'s loan would be provided through the Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE), a non-profit nongovernmental organization based in Bamenda, Cameroon. GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and the alleviation of poverty through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.

For this reason he works Fridays through Sundays, including fair days, because these are the days with the greatest potential for sales.

Mar\u00eda una vez vivi\u00f3 el duelo de la separaci\u00f3n, se refugi\u00f3 en la costura  \u201cfue como su  terapia ocupacional\u201d y justamente en ese momento una  buena vecina y amiga que le vio su potencial y conoc\u00eda que Mar\u00eda no tenia dinero para preparase t\u00e9cnicamente en ese arte, le empez\u00f3 a ense\u00f1ar cada clase de costura que ella aprend\u00eda en una academia; as\u00ed fue como se dedic\u00f3 a hacer colchas, fundas, cortinas y en general productos de lencer\u00eda y arreglos que adornan los ba\u00f1os, las paredes y la cocina de los hogares.

A. is a woman who works in lingerie. Her nature allowed her to develop this business. Since she was very little she would help her mother make hems and sew on buttons and she always liked doing it. Sewing is an art, and in her family it has been passed down from generation to generation. Her grandmother also made clothing without attending the academy to study the art.  \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda lives in the Ciudadela 20 de Julio neighborhood and she has 3 children that she has brought up very well while separated from her husband. She gets along very well with him and he has always taken responsibility for his children. Once Maria was living with the pain of the separation, she took refuge in sewing: \"it was like occupational therapy\". Just then, a good neighbor and friend who saw her potential and knew that Maria didn't have any money to study this art technically, began to teach her sewing classes that she has learned at the academy. This was how she began to make blankets, pillowcases, curtains and general lingerie products and bathroom, wall, and kitchen home decor arrangements.  She sews with her familiar sewing machine, a gift from her mother from many years ago. She has to go to her cousin's overlocking machine, since she doesn't have her own.

He was one of many people who moved to Europe to try his luck, but when things did not work out as expected, he returned to Bolivia to face a harsh reality.  Wilfredo also met his wife in Europe, so he returned first and she followed thereafter once she had filed her documents.  After experiencing the prayers and tears of their daughters, Wilfredo and his wife chose to remain a family over seeking fortune.  \r\n<p>\r\nUsing the money he brought back with him, he bought a minibus while his wife started a retail business.  To improve her tiny shop, they decided to build a bigger one.  For this reason, Wilfredo is requesting a loan to buy cement, paint, and other materials.  They are hard workers and emphasize that for them the family unit comes first.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

E. is a woman of many profitable businesses; she knows business.  Each day she prepares to not only improve herself and adapt to life's changes, but also to offer a promising future to her three young children.  On weekends, you can find Jennifer working in her house to make and sell fast food.  From Monday to Friday, she works as an employee in a pharmacy located inside the military district.  The military district also offers the potential of important customers, between the soldiers and the administrative personnel, for her other business, selling various merchandise like clothing, footwear and cosmetics.  With support and advice from her mother, from who she learned to be an enterprising woman and who also participates in the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation programs, she combines various profitable business ventures.\r\n\r\nJennifer and her three children live in her parents' home in the Carrizal Neighborhood of Barranquilla City.  Even as a single mother, she has given her children the chance to get ahead.  The positive results earned from great responsibility and discipline that she has seen in her mother have been the greatest driving forces in Jennifer's working life.  With her Kiva loan of $2.000.000 COP ($1,100 USD), which is her fourth loan with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, she purchased a covered cart specially designed for fast food, (as you can see in the photograph where she appears in the covered cart with her mother).  The rest of the money was invested in the purchase of supplies and raw materials. \r\n\r\nLike all enterprising women, she wants to have her own home in order to offer her children a good, independent family environment and the opportunity to be successful professionals in the future.  She works a lot, both independently and also for another business, because she has such a great desire to get ahead.  She is constantly training and learning, and that is why she was able to get a good job as a sales clerk in the pharmacy in the military district.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Marni

M. is from the village of Omonay, Damulog, Bukidnon. She is 28 years old and married. To make a living, Alona owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector running a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food & daily use products in the local community. Alona has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 8,500 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Alona joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Alona has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Alona is requesting a new loan of 11,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and working capital. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Alona from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

A. is from the village of Salvacion, Kadingilan, Bukidnon. She is 53 years old and married. To make a living, Letecia owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector running a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food & daily use products in the local community. Letecia has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 9,500 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Letecia joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Letecia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 11,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Letecia is requesting a new loan of 14,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Letecia from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":577307,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Natividad has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month from these activities.

In the future, Shila plans to improve the economic conditions of her family. She thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\nDairy cows are an important source of nutrition and income in Nepal. Cows are never raised for beef, but for their milk from which curd (duy) and fresh cheese (paneer) are made. Jersey cows are the preferred breed for milking. On average, a dairy cow in Nepal will produce about 10 liters of milk each day. In the local market, a liter of milk sells for about USD $0.50. In addition to producing milk, cows provide dung that is used in home construction, as fuel for fires, and can be captured in methane storage tanks. The purchase of a dairy cow, made possible through a BPW loan, is an investment that will repay itself many times over.\r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by BPW's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low income women. In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.

All of them strive day to day to get ahead in their businesses.  To prosper is one of the objectives that they have.\r\n\r\nThat is the case with Epifania, a very hard-working woman.  Upon separating from her husband she started to work selling food from a cart close to her house.  It was her mother-in-law who urged her to do this.  She is also a small businesswoman.  \r\n\r\nNine years ago she started selling prickly pears (fruit of the mountain range).  She extracts the cochineal insect, a parasite that is often used to give color to clothing fabrics, from the pulpy part.  She sold this fruit by going door to door and at the markets.  She also worked as a domestic employee, which she says she has done since she was very young. \r\n\r\nWith the first loan that she received she bought supplies to make \u201ccachangas\u201d (a type of bread maD. from wheat flour), coffee, and fried chicken.  In time she was attracting customers.  That is how she has increased her capital.  Now, because of the good seasoning that her food has, she has been hired to cook for special events like birthdays and anniversaries.\r\n\r\nThis business has gone well for her.  With her income from these sales she knew to give her children an education.  At the same time she built a house on land that she inherited from her deceased parents.\r\n\r\nHer children are professionals.  Her last son is 14 years old, and he is still in school.\r\n\r\nShe needs to invest in supplies to continue selling kebobs, fried fish, and cachangas.  The anniversary of the country of Peru is near, and there will be lots of tourists in the area.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2450,"image":{"id":577506,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Buy supplies: chicken, fish, and beef heart to make her kebobs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chosica","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.943056 -76.709444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2010-08-03T00:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cesar Rufino","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Erlinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yuliana Angela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Susana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Niria Rosalina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariluz ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gladys Del Milagro","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Epifania ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":6900,"loan_amount":2450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1380},{"due_date":"2010-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1380},{"due_date":"2010-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1380},{"due_date":"2010-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1380},{"due_date":"2010-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1380}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":490},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":490},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":490},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":490},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":490}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":490,"local_amount":1380,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:00:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1382.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166831584,"comment":null},{"amount":490,"local_amount":1380,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:55:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1382.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172098125,"comment":null},{"amount":490,"local_amount":1380,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:36:06Z","rounded_local_amount":1382.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177390794,"comment":null},{"amount":490,"local_amount":1380,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:44:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1382.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182529074,"comment":null},{"amount":490,"local_amount":1380,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:52:45Z","rounded_local_amount":1382.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188665193,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-08-16T21:10:31Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T12:52:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":219534,"name":"Tereza De Jesus","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Tereza es una mujer de 49 a\u00f1os de edad, trabajadora desde su juventud, para lograr la subsistencia de cada d\u00eda.
