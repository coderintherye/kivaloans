Unfortunately she has already endured a lot of suffering, having gone through a lot of illnesses including breast cancer, for which she had surgery. Her husband makes traditional children's cribs. This is a very hand-intensive process that does not require any special equipment. He studied the craft under an old craftsman for 2 years. Today he makes the cribs entirely on his own and transports them to market, where Mairamchon sells them.

The official name of this borrowing group is Ph\u00fa M\u1eabn 1 - 02 (2).\r\n\r\n\r\nL. is married and has 2 school-aged children.  To make a living, L. owns & operates a business venture in the food sector operating a butcher shop.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from butchering & selling pork in the local community.  L. has been engaged in this business for over 5 years and earns approximately 2.500.000 - 3.000.000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2007, L. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.

She is now requesting a new L. of 3.894.000 VND which will be used to purchase additional products to sell.  The L. will be the 4th L. taken out by the borrower from SEDA.

The market where he sells the livestock is far from his home and so he has to rent a vehicle to transport the animals there. Gulom wants to have his own vehicle.

Abdujalil has always been hard-working man, who has made sure, from his young age, that his family never goes without their daily bread. He is married with 4 children. <P>\r\n\r\nAbdujalil has a grocery store where he sells different kinds of foodstuff. With a starting capital of 500 USD, thanks to his perseverance and dedication, Abdujalil began this enterprise 5 years ago. Over time he expanded his business and today this business has become a family business with his whole family engaged in this business. <P>\r\n\r\nToday Abdujalil needs to buy additional foodstuffs to increase the range of his goods.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\t\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous, and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment, forcing hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<P>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<P>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

      \"Simple woman\" describes Mrs. Cesaria M., 54 years old, who is married and lives at San Isidro,Jimenez, Misamis Occidental. She is blessed with two children. Cesaria thought of a livelihood project in which she could help her husband. She ventured into buying & selling of RTWs (ready-to-wear clothes). Her primary customers are neighbors, friends and members of Paglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative. \r\n<P>        \r\n       Having a mark-up of 20% per item sold is an additional income for her family. In this way, she can support her husband financially. Being a member of the cooperative is a big help for her project. \r\n<P>         \r\n       Now, she is applying for 14,900 Philippine Pesos to buy additional RTW's for sale. She aims to build a house someday.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<P>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Baglon is a widow who on a daily basis seeks the betterment of her dearest son. She works with great effort for them and wants to continue to do so to build a prominent and promising future. Ever since she was a little girl, she has been dedicated to farming activities. She was raised this way and has been a stable source of income until this day. For more than 12 years Baglon has been growing some production on her land with the help of her son. To continue to work and to obtain a very good quantity and quality of crops Baglon wants to borrow money for growing potatoes and onions on her land. For that she needs to purchase seeds and fertilizers. Let\u2019s show solidarity to this selfless mother that looks out for what is best for her children.  \r\n<P>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n<P>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<P>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They live in polygamous households.  The women of this group are all restauranteurs.  Given their village's location, at a highly populated crossroads, they sell rice, beans, meat, <i>fonio<\/i> (a kind of millet), etc. locally in eateries. \r\n<p>\r\nTo expand their businesses, the group members decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso loan program three years ago.  The loan amounts have gone from 50,000 francs CFA for the first loan to 200,000 francs for the sixth solidarity loan.  All the other loans have been correctly repaid.\r\n<p>\r\nThe current loan will be used to buy sacks of rice, buckets of peanut butter, and other ingredients for catering.  Thus, with this new loan, they each plan to realize an average profit of 230,000 francs in the course of this cycle.  In addition to the loan payments, they intend to address common family expenses.

Joining the Kiva field partner, Paglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative, is a great opportunity for her to get the financial assistance she needs. Today, she would like to borrow $250 to purchase sacks of feed, and she would like to start raising a few chicks for added income. From the income that she will gain, Eva will be able to pay her loan, and like any other parent, provide her children a good and bright future.

She is married, 60 years old, and has three children who are 34, 32, and 29 who work and study.  When she was younger, Doris was studying at a university, but could not finish because she suffered from hemiplegia (paralysis of half the body) for more than two years.  The doctors declared it to be terminal, but she put her faith in God and was healed.  She started working.  In the morning she would take her children to school and the neighbor ladies told her they would pay her to take their children to school, too.  In this way she started a school transportation business.  She stopped working at her other job because she earned more with the school transportation.  In the afternoons she works sewing clothing that people have ordered from her.  Doris needs a loan of 1,600 soles to buy fabric and to fix her car.  Since being in Finca, she can count on loans in order to invest more.

She is married, 58 years old, and has five married children.  Gloria used to be a street vendor, selling stockings from a cart in the market, but she had to stop working for a time when she suffered a slipped disk.  Later, she decided to work at home, setting up a small grocery called Bodega Gloria which she has operated for two years.  Gloria needs a 1000-soles loan to buy cold drinks, beer, milk and bags of sugar.  Since starting at Finca, she's learned how to invest and she now invests all her borrowings in merchandise for the business.  She likes the camaraderie of the group and the sense of solidarity that the community bank provides.

Her son, Alfredo, 31, lives in the city of Ayachucho.  For 7 years, she's earned a living making necklaces, rings and earrings from stones, beads, seeds, etc. or, in other words, practicing the art of making costume jewelry.  She works at home and the business has become her main source of income.  Even though her husband works, as a [bus?] driver, she's never wanted to depend on him and has always tried to cover her expenses and those of the business.  Furthermore, Caciana is used to being busy and the business is a means of both earning a living and developing creatively.  She invents new styles that she even exports because she has a contact who sells what she makes overseas.  When she has large orders, she provides employment for her friends because can't cope with the workload.  She pays them a percentage of her earnings.  There are difficulties, though.  The effort required to properly finish her products has damaged her eyesight.  Her children don't want her to go on working and she hopes, in the future, to set up a small workshop that she would only manage, something that would allow her to still have a hand at a business that she very much enjoys.  She's applying for a loan to buy larger quantities of materials so that she can go on creating new styles of necklaces, earrings and rings, as well as cover her last order which she still hasn't completed.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":309274,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":"Buy materials for crafts business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-04-24T19:20:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Caciana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2009-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2009-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2009-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":135}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.72},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.72},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.72},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.72},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.72},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.4}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":45.72,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2009-05-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:55:16Z","rounded_local_amount":141.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44596118,"comment":null},{"amount":45.72,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2009-06-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:40:42Z","rounded_local_amount":141.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990385,"comment":null},{"amount":45.72,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:41:59Z","rounded_local_amount":141.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211507,"comment":null},{"amount":45.72,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2009-08-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:22:22Z","rounded_local_amount":141.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641014,"comment":null},{"amount":45.72,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2009-09-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:35:34Z","rounded_local_amount":141.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080473,"comment":null},{"amount":46.4,"local_amount":135,"processed_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:05:49Z","rounded_local_amount":144.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996633,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-04-24T20:36:35Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T03:05:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":104377,"name":"Zula Saudah\u2018S Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Saudah is 30 years of age, a single mother of three children, aged between 9 and 13.

They have their own place but they rent a house that they use as a workshop for the business.  For 10 years, Esperanza has operated an auto body repair and paint shop.  They decided to start the business because her husband is skilled at repairing and painting auto bodies.  The business has grown little by little and their services are now in such demand that they have two employees to help them.  They charge up to 750 soles per vehicle, depending on what damage was done, some of which they spend on buying the materials they need to return the vehicle to good condition.  Esperanza very much enjoys the work and being a woman has never been an impediment to doing it.  She tells us that she prefers the hard work of the shop to the drudgery of her kitchen at home.  Her husband, as well as she herself, hope to continue working hard to get ahead and improve the business.

Her mother arrived in the capital with no money, and she had to take care of her four children.  Even though she was little, Liliana had to help her mother, who worked as a seamstress, to support her family.  Happily, her hard work paid off.  She was able to buy a small piece of land where they lived in the swamps in the Ventanilla district of Lima.  \r\n\r\nNow, Liliana remembers the efforts her mother, her siblings, and she made in the different jobs they had to do to generate income for their home.

It is because of this that he learned the basic concepts of carpentry, which over time he has been able to perfect.  Today, he uses these skills to design and build guitars, which he manufactures from plywood or hardwood, according to the customer's order.  He only builds the body of the guitar, then his nephews apply paint and varnish to achieve a finished product.  Nicolas likes his work very much, since he is able to do it from his home, and can thus keep an eye on his sons, both of whom are in school and need lots of help and guidance from him with their schoolwork.  It is because of this that he wants to continue expanding his production and also the size of his workshop, in hope of solidifying his position as the best guitar manufacturer of his area. He knows the path will be difficult, since nothing is as easy as it seems, and he realizes he must be very careful and detailed in building his guitars, paying attention to all the final touches, so that they sound and shine as well as they ought to.

They each have different ways of earning a living like selling groceries, selling empanadas in educational institutions, and selling clothing.  The men make a living in home construction and plumbing.  As with all commercial areas, there is always competition among products in the markets, but each member knows how to overcome this obstacle.  The loans will be used to buy materials and supplies to improve their products and work tools so they can increase their incomes and give their families a better quality of life.

Rocio is 48 years old and is married. She used to work in education as an administrator, but didn\u2019t like the work very much. She quit her job when she was invited to travel to England to work on a cruise ship teaching Spanish to children, but before she left she met her husband, a schoolteacher who lived next door to her, and decided to stay in Peru. They eventually married, and she now has her own small business selling clothing and makeup by catalog.\r\n<p>\r\nRocio is requesting a loan of 1000 soles.

He is a taxi driver, a job that he has done for 10 years because he has always enjoyed driving. \r\n\r\nHe remembers that he began at age 15 as a ticket collector on the bus that provided transport service on the various routes in the city of Lima. From there he took the initiative to learn to drive and did it. Because of that he works today with distinction in this field and does not see himself undertaking another line of work that does not have to do with transport. On the other hand,  things are not always easy and he often encounters people that do not want to pay nor is the work free of the risks that are the order of the day, plus the traffic congestion. But even so, he loves his work and wants to continue progressing. \r\n\r\nAlthough the car that he now drives is not his own, he has plans to repair a car he bought several years ago. It is a little old, but with good repairs it would be in good condition to work and save the money he pays to rent the car he now drives. Walter has had three loans with PRISMO Microfinance and has always been characterized by being very punctual in his payments. \r\n\r\nWith this money he will fix his own car, doing some body work and painting it to make it operational and begin working with it.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Daniel Burke, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":309344,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","use":"Repair his own car so he can stop renting one.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-04-25T15:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Walter","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":335}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.22},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.22},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.22},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.22},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.22},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.9}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":108.22,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-05-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:55:15Z","rounded_local_amount":336.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44596123,"comment":null},{"amount":108.22,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-06-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:40:39Z","rounded_local_amount":336.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990390,"comment":null},{"amount":108.22,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:41:57Z","rounded_local_amount":336.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211512,"comment":null},{"amount":108.22,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-08-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:22:20Z","rounded_local_amount":336.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641019,"comment":null},{"amount":108.22,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-09-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:35:34Z","rounded_local_amount":336.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080478,"comment":null},{"amount":108.9,"local_amount":335,"processed_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:05:37Z","rounded_local_amount":338.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996637,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-04-25T21:55:43Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T03:05:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":104401,"name":"Fanny Beatriz","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fanny is a member of the Virgen Asunta Village Bank in the town of Urco, located just outside the larger town of Calca and about an hour from the city of Cusco.

Her work is selling underwear.  Her mother-in-law, who lives in the same house, has a store and so Milagros makes use of some space there to sell her items.  This arrangement is very beneficial because it allows her to be near her little George who needs lots of care.  That's why this work suits her well; because she can work at home and at the same time generate some income for the household, separate from her husband's salary.

Because of her separation, she became responsible for taking care of her home.  Thanks to the support she gets from her parents, she can provide for her children.  \r\n\r\nShe has always liked to be well kept, and she was interested in studying cosmetology.  She learned not only how to cut hair, but she also learned how to give cleansing treatments, massages, and different skin treatments.

Every day she offers better service to her customers who loyally visit every month.  \r\n\r\nGladys wants to put a Spa on the premises.  To do that, she needs to set up and expand her space to offer diverse beauty services.  But, she cannot do that due to lack of funds.

Meanwhile, she will keep working, like always, to kindly tend to her customers and offer them what they need at all times.  Her business is open from seven in the morning until ten at night.  \r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with MFP.  She hopes that staying in the group will be very beneficial.  She will use the money to buy merchandise to stock her business with new and needed products for her customers.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":309488,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"Increase merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-04-26T19:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leonor","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:58:06Z","rounded_local_amount":168.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44596133,"comment":null},{"amount":56.33,"local_amount":173.32,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:45:37Z","rounded_local_amount":174.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990400,"comment":null},{"amount":57.76,"local_amount":177.72,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:47:04Z","rounded_local_amount":179.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211522,"comment":null},{"amount":61.66,"local_amount":189.72,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:29:08Z","rounded_local_amount":191.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641029,"comment":null},{"amount":63.38,"local_amount":195,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:43:50Z","rounded_local_amount":196.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080488,"comment":null},{"amount":31.7,"local_amount":97.57,"processed_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:11:11Z","rounded_local_amount":98.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996647,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-04-26T21:01:37Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T03:11:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":104452,"name":"Magdalena","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Magdalena es socia del Banco Comunal \u201cMar\u00eda Asunci\u00f3n Galindo\u201d de la comunidad Kajje, distrito de Juli, provincia de Chucuito, en el departamento de Puno.

When she began her business she had very few pairs of shoes to sell, but she knew to invest her earnings, and today she offers a considerably larger quantity of merchandise.  Blanca acquires her shoes in other cities, and later distributes them to her customers.  Occasionally her relatives help her with the sales, when she cannot carry the heavy packages.  For Blanca, this activity is very satisfying, both because of the money it earns, and because shoes are not perishable, and do not lose value if they are not immediately sold.  For the future, Blanca wants to have her own permanent space to sell her shoes in, so that her business could be more stable.  This is the second time that she has had a loan with MFP, and she is very certain that in this new cycle her work with the communal bank will be more satisfactory than her previous experience.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Burhoniddin is 55 years old. He is married with three children. He sells cattle and also provides transportation service. As a rule, he purchases the small cattle in the central market, feeds them and than resells them for higher prices in the local market. Being in this business for 20 years, he knows very well how to choose the animals, how to breed them and look after them. Thus, he gets up every morning in order to feed the animals and to look after them. His knowledge and skills make his business successful to generate a stable, considerable income for his large family. \r\n<p>\r\nBurhoniddin has a large and friendly family who are always trying to help each other. Today knowing that the prices for the animals are not so high now, but will increase for sure, Burhoniddin is planning to enlarge his stock and purchase cattle. With this purpose, he requests $800. You could become an important part in the Burhoniddin family's life and he deeply appreciates the trust and support you are giving him.             \r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes being a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

They live mainly in large polygamous families, and they know one another through community ties in the Bamanan Kin district of Markala (fourth administrative region of the Republic of Mali).  They essentially do commerce in Wax <i>pagnes<\/i> (colorful West African cloth), firewood, condiments, grains, the making of shea nut butter, etc.  \r\n<p>\r\nAfter having seen success cases of other Markala women who were able to run businesses and earn revenues through Soro Yiriwaso, the group members got organized more, so as to join the loan program.  They are now on their fourth solidarity loan, which will be used to buy:  25 sacks of millet, 10 sacks of beans, 2,500 kg of of onions, and 25 sacks of <i>fakoye<\/i> (a wild plant used in making sauces, especially in northern Mali).  Supplies are gotten at the weekly fairs of Diamarabougou from wholesalers and producers.  The goods are sold retail, cash or credit accepted, to customers composed of men and women at the Kirango marketplace. \r\n<p>\r\nThe group members each hope to realize an average monthly profit of 35,000 francs CFA that will be used to make loan interest payments and to cover the cost of school supplies for the children.

Supplies of peanuts and millet are gotten in Boussin and at the weekly market of Diamarabougou Markala;  the rice, in Dougabougou and Siribala.

Shuhrat is 25 years old and has been married for about two years. His wife is a housekeeper.\r\n<p>\r\nShuhrat has been running his business for about two years. He rents a retail store where he sells different kinds of housewares. His business is the family\u2019s main source of income. Shuhrat is trying to have a wide range of goods of good quality to meet the requirements of his customers and to satisfy the needs of clients with different levels of income.\r\n<p>\r\nToday, Shuhrat requests $3000 for the term of 12 months. This is the first time that Shuhrat has asked for a loan through IMON International and Kiva. It will be used to buy more housewares in order to increase the range of his goods. Due to the profitability of his business, the determination of this micro-entrepreneur and his experience in the business, this customer is qualified to receive this loan. \r\n<p><br>\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<P>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She has one daughter of her own, who is now 16, and two orphans that she provides for.  \r\n<p>\r\nJeska has been in the business of selling used clothing for 13 years, but her business has undergone many changes during that period. Jeska started as a secondhand clothes hawker, with capital of 72,000 USH, in 1994 after the death of her husband. By 1995, her capital had increased to 90,000 USH with additional assets of two goats. She bought one of these goats at 8,000 USH and the other at 15,000 USH. In 1996, with her increased capital--it had reached 150,000 USH by then--she shifted her business operations to a market called Kizinda along the Mbarare.  After that change, she acquired a third goat at 25,000 USH.  \r\n<p>\r\nThese days Jeska is able to earn 144,000 USH profit per month. Jeska says that she is successful in her business because she is very honest and because she is able to be very convincing when communicating with her clients.  She hopes that this style of business will allow her to become a wholesale supplier of used clothing. She says the major challenges to her business include transporting her goods to different markets--she tries to sell in three different markets each week. There is also the risk of thieves on route to the markets and just generally reaching strategic selling points.    \r\n<p>\r\nJeska has accomplished a lot with her family as well as her business. In 1997, she was able to send her only child to Birungi Nursery School. After completing a few years there, her daughter went to a government-aided school called Kashozi Boarding Primary School. In 2007, her daughter joined Kashenyi Crane High School, a private school for secondary education. Jeska hopes that her daughter will be able to continue all the way up to university level.    \r\n<p>\r\nToday Jeska is requesting a loan of 200,000 USH.  This loan will primarily be used to pay school fees for her children.

has owned a bakery for ten years. Jamal is a 43-year old man who lives in Bint Jbeil, Southern Lebanon with his wife and their three children. He does saj and mankoucheh. A saj is a metal oven where you make the saj bread. Saj is a traditional Lebanese cooking dome used to make markouk (flat round bread) and doughy confections or mankoucheh. A mankoucheh looks like a folded pizza. The most common toppings are zaatar (thyme), jebneh (cheese) and lahm bi ajin (minced meat). You can eat it any time of day but somehow it tastes better in the morning. \n\nJamal has requested a loan from Al Majmoua in order to purchase supplies for his bakery.
