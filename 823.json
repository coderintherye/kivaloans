She is married to Jose, who is employed, and they have 2 beautiful children: Rosa, aged 18, and Renzo, aged 7, whom they love a lot.  They live comfortably in their own home.  Deyba has a business selling groceries.  She sells from a store that is set up in her own house.  This is where she tends to her customers, who are mainly her neighbors.  She started this business more than 2 years ago because she needed to have additional income.  She took some small capital that she had saved up, and together with a loan, she managed to buy some small quantities of merchandise.  In this way she attracted customers.  She thinks that her business is profitable because of the good earnings it gives her, and because it has been well-received by her customers.  She enjoys the business because it allows her to stay in her house and also enjoy the tranquility of having an income.  In addition, she can use her free time to care for her house.  However, she doesn't like it when her customers request to make their purchases on credit, because she has had some bad experiences with these types of sales when people fail to make their payments.  For this reason she no longer sells on credit, making all of her sales on a cash basis.  But as she is seeing good results, she has plans to continue to grow and expand her business.

They have two children, ages 3 and 1.  She lives in the Santa Cruz de Yojoa municipality.\r\n\r\nAna has a business, a grocery store that she established three years ago with her own means.  She wanted to work at a business activity that would allow her to be there to take care of her children.  That was when that she thought of working independently.  She set up her store where she offers her customers food products like flour, sugar, lard, rice, beans, meat, dairy products, and soft drinks, among others.\r\n\r\nShe says that she has a lot of customers.  Since she started her business it has improved, little by little, with the help of the loans she has received from ODEF.  She tends to her business every day of the week.  She starts very early in order to give her customers good service. \r\n\r\nShe is requesting her third loan for 26,000 lempiras to buy more food products like basic grains, dairy products, and soft drinks, etc.  With this investment she will manage to offer a variety of products to her clientele and to improve her income.\r\n\r\nHer plan is to continue improving in her business. She will do this in order to continue generating the income that has so far allowed her to support her children.  She will also do this to have financial solvency so that her children will be able to go to school in the future.  \r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1051883,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"to buy more food products like basic grains, dairy products, and soft drinks, etc. to stock her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Pe\u00f1a Blanca,Cortes","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":201,"posted_date":"2012-04-07T00:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-07T00:20:02Z","loan_amount":1375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana Cristina","last_name":"Milla Giron","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":26000,"loan_amount":1375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":468.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":560.55},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":577.37},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":594.69},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":612.53},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":630.91},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":649.84},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":669.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":689.41},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":710.09},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":731.4},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":753.34},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":775.94},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":799.22},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":823.19},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":847.89},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":873.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":899.53},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":926.51},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":954.31},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":982.94},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1012.42},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1042.8},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1074.08},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1106.3},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1139.49},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1173.68},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1208.89},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1245.15},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1466.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.78},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.64},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.53},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.45},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.4},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.36},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.37},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.4},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.46},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.55},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.68},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.84},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.03},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.27},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.54},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.84},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.18},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.57},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.47},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.98},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.54},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.15},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.8},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.51},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.26},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.07},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.93},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.85},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":408924,"name":"Maurice Ochieng  Nyawira","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maurice is 31 years old and married with 2 children.

She is single and is the mother of one son who is in school.  She studied through the seventh grade but stopped due to her parents' lack of financial resources.  She lives in her own home with her family and also supports five nieces and nephews who live with her.\r\n\r\nShe left Manjacaze for Maputo in the district of Boane in search of employment.  She has worked as a writer at the central prison for more than 26 years.  She also has had a business for more than seven years.  She makes 4,556.86 meticals at the prison and almost 5,000 at her business.  She puts this money towards her home's expenses and also saves some in her bank account at the BCI bank.\r\n\r\nShe has had loans with BCI, which she put towards her home and managed to pay back without any problems.  She became familiar with Hluvuku through a friend who is also a client of the institution.  This is her second loan with Hluvuku in the amount of 16,000 meticals.  She will use it to buy chairs to resell.  Her previous loan was for 16,000 meticals, and she put it towards her home.\r\n\r\nShe promises to make her payments on time.  In the future, she wants to grow her business and finish her home, for which she plans on requesting more loans from Hluvuku."}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1065213,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Goods Distribution","sector":"Wholesale","use":"to buy chairs for resale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Boane, Maputo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-26.041667 32.325278","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":"2012-04-07T04:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-07T04:10:02Z","loan_amount":575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lodovina Lucas","last_name":"Mangue","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":16000,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":591.21},{"due_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":618.3},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":646.64},{"due_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":676.28},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":707.28},{"due_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":739.69},{"due_date":"2012-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":773.6},{"due_date":"2012-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":809.05},{"due_date":"2012-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":846.13},{"due_date":"2013-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":884.91},{"due_date":"2013-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":925.47},{"due_date":"2013-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":967.89},{"due_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1012.25},{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1058.65},{"due_date":"2013-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1107.17},{"due_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1157.91},{"due_date":"2013-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1210.98},{"due_date":"2013-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1266.59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.25},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.22},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.24},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.3},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.42},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.58},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.8},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.08},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.4},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.81},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.25},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.79},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.38},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.04},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.79},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.61},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.52},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.52}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":408947,"name":"Rehema","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rehema used the previous loan to buy baby items and has applied for another one to buy the same products.

She has 3 children, but she lives with only one of them, Lisbeth, in her own house, located in the town of Paccha. She mainly grows potatoes, corn and also alfalfa to feed her animals. She has cows, calves and sheep, which with the help of her daughter she takes to graze in the countryside when her alfalfa production is low. This happens generally in the summer season, when it is not produced in sufficient quantities, and what she is able to harvest she sells at the provincial market in her town. She also sells her animals from time to time, such as sheep, cows and bulls, when an opportunity for a sale presents itself. Generally, the buyers come to her home. She thinks it is good to work in these two parallel activities to maintain stability in her income and gradually expand her business. However, since she is very hard-working, she also works packaging chicken meat in a company. She reports that she does this 2 or 3 times a week, since she has to take care of her animals and crops. Now she has set concrete goals to continue to expand her business, and she is sure that she will achieve them. She found out about MFP through a neighbor in her community who invited her to join the communal bank, where she is now a member for the second cycle. Throughout this time she has demonstrated responsibility with her payments, and she has won confidence for being a person who can be vouched for, so she can continue having access to loans, which are her opportunity for growth. \r\n\r\nUpon receiving her support, Olga will invest the funds she is requesting in buying medicines in bulk to prepare by type and dosage for her animals, and if she still has sufficient funds, she will also be able to buy alfalfa for them. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1053211,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy medicines for her animals and alfalfa.

When she founded a family with her husband, they decided to intensify their activity by planting mainly potatoes and broad beans in large quantities. They also have grazing grounds for their cattle in various plots of arable land that Emerita and her husband inherited. Agriculture is an activity she very much enjoys and likes doing because she is always in contact with earth and nature, which she finds very calming. But since she is a hardworking woman, every morning she takes her bulls, cows and sheep out to graze. She tells us that she wants to churn cheese but does not yet own enough dairy cows. What she does use her bulls for is to till her own land: as she says, \"this way I do not have to pay someone to prepare the soil\". Very soon, she will buy more sheep, with the help of her husband who works in a mine. She belongs to the communal bank \"productores agr\u00edcolas\" (agriculture producers) and this is her seventh loan with Microfinanzas Prisma.

Today, her herd numbers 35 sheep, 10 lambs, 4 goats, and 4 horses.

In order to this, she plans to hire workers.  Her goal is to increase production since there is demand for this product.  Since the prices tend to stay high, Gleydys will be able to earn more income.  \r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":75,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1049288,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to hire workers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-04-08T05:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-08T05:10:02Z","loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gleydys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":145.54},{"due_date":"2012-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":158.17},{"due_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":162.6},{"due_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":171.71},{"due_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":177.37},{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":184.61}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.58},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.31},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.98},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.39},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.51},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.23}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":409893,"name":"Lucy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lucy is a 44-year-old married woman with children, living in Fort Portal, Uganda.

She sets up in the front of her house with a table and some chairs.\r\n\r\nShe has had this business for ten years, and she counts on her sister\u2019s help.

Her income allows her to pay her bills and her household expenses.  She does now like being physically tired.  She has to get up very early in the morning to make the daily preparations.  However, this does not discourage her, and she continues with her business.  She wishes to expand her business and to improve her roof, where she will be able to tend to her customers more comfortably.\r\n\r\nThis will be her 14th loan with MFP.

She is one of those ladies who started working as soon as she had completed her education. As a matter of fact, she had been working while studying on order to contribute to her family\u2019s budget. Since she had devoted all her life to working, she had postponed the idea of marriage and only recently became engaged. As an eagerly devoted business woman following her graduation, she started working in the printing shop of her uncle without knowing anything about the business. Due to her eagerness and perseverance within a short time, she mastered the printing business. In time, when her uncle started a new business, he turned over the management and ownership of the printing house to Serap. Naturally she had some financial difficulties in the beginning and she still has, but she overcomes these difficulties with the support of Maya. She developed her business of the printing shop into the organization business, started entering into areas such as wedding invitations, and wedding candies.  Currently she has very good customer connections. She will use the current loan from Maya via Kiva to buy paper and edge cutting machines, and stamps. These machines will help her to decrease her costs by keeping certain jobs in house which she had been previously outsourcing, thus increasing her profit.  She always expresses her gratitude to Maya for their support.\r\n \r\nThe two other members of the group are marketing the products of a cleaning company both from home and from the store (with the support of Serap).

She is married and has 2 children, one of whom is currently in school. For the past 3 years, Calvin has been working hard to manage her small business, selling clothes. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Calvin has requested a loan of 2,000,000 Ugandan shillings from BRAC Uganda.

She lives with her life partner and their children in their own house.\r\n\r\nElizabeth\u2019s business is selling food, mostly breakfasts and a set menu.  She has a place set up at her own house where she opened her restaurant.  It is set up with tables, chairs, and the utensils needed to tend to her customers very well.  Seeing that her area is busy, she feels that she has demand.  Due to her life partner\u2019s illness, she saw the financial needs that her household had.  She decided to start in this business over 12 years ago.  In the beginning she worked alone, but now she counts on help from her children.\r\n\r\nShe considers her business to be very profitable.  She says this is because the profit margins are very good, and the regular clientele that she has are to her benefit.  She really likes to cook.  She learned from her mother, who taught her the secrets of good seasoning.  With this she hopes to be able to continue with customer acceptance and being their preference.\r\n\r\nAlso, she has plans to grow, and in the future she plans to expand her restaurant by opening a branch in a commercial zone in the city of Pucallpa.

She also comments that she is comfortable with her communal bank because she considers the members to be good people.  She will use the requested 3,000 soles to buy ingredients for food preparation.  She will buy things like rice, oil, and others.  She hopes to be able to get low prices for buying for cash and in volume.  This is because prices rise more and more.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1050597,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"to buy rice, oil, and other ingredients to prepare food.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-04-08T16:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-08T16:30:02Z","loan_amount":1125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elizabeth ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":236.47},{"due_date":"2012-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":262.23},{"due_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":265.93},{"due_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":286.38},{"due_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":292.16},{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":304.25},{"due_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":318.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":331.41},{"due_date":"2012-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":345.62},{"due_date":"2013-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":356.88}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.68},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.73},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.39},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.56},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.09},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":119.5},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":124.28},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":129.61},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":133.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":408548,"name":"Marcia Griselda Castro Ponce","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Marcia Griselda tiene 43 a\u00f1os de edad, es madre soltera y tiene 2 hijos de 17 y 13 a\u00f1os de edad, vive en La Lopez, Choloma Cortes.\nMarcia se dedica a la venta de ropa de segunda mano.

He lives with his mother, Guida, his father, Gregorio, and his two siblings, Melvin and Talia, whom he cares for in his own home, located in the town of Ancalayo.  As the oldest son, he works to help his parents and siblings.  \"My parents are older, and they need my support,\" he states.  To do this, he has for some time now, with the help of Angel, his partner, rented a brick-making workshop where he makes 30,000 bricks a month, selling these on the basis of monthly orders to his regular customers.  He is always offering his customers the best products that he knows how to make.  In addition to this, thanks to his efforts, he has 2 bulls that he feeds with a lot of dedication.  He says that he also cultivates alfalfa, which he uses to feed them.  Thus, he must bear long days of work plowing the land.  Now he wants to start up a business raising cows, because there is a demand for fresh milk.  To do this, he will take the first step by purchasing a quality cow.  This is his first loan with MFP, and he feels happy, because he found the help that he needed so much to realize his plans.  In addition, he is responsible in all of his work, and so he promises to be on time with his payments.  Once Blidmer receives your support, he will invest the money requested in the purchase of a cow, which costs an average of 2,000 Peruvian soles.  He has already saved up a little money, and so with this loan he will gather together enough money to make this purchase.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":25,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1056902,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy a cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-04-08T17:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-08T17:40:03Z","loan_amount":575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Blidmer ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":104.72},{"due_date":"2012-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":106.63},{"due_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":107.31},{"due_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":115.58},{"due_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":116.99},{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":121.26},{"due_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":126.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":130.31},{"due_date":"2012-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":135.74},{"due_date":"2013-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":140.01},{"due_date":"2013-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":144.76},{"due_date":"2013-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":150.02}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.14},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.88},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.13},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.31},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.84},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.49},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.55},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.96},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.03},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.49},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.51}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":410196,"name":"Oretha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Oretha is 42 years old and lives in the Airport area.

Her hope is to continue keeping her business table and functioning in a profitable way as she\u2019s done so far for her family\u2019s wellbeing.\r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":25,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1057113,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy rice, sugar and oil.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Granada","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2012-04-08T20:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-08T20:40:04Z","loan_amount":225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Esperanza Del Carmen \t\t ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":215.7,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":23.97},{"due_date":"2012-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":23.97},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":23.97},{"due_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":23.97},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":23.97},{"due_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":23.97},{"due_date":"2012-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":23.97},{"due_date":"2012-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":23.97},{"due_date":"2012-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":23.94}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.01},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.01},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.01},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.97}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":409098,"name":"Carlos Alberto","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Carlos, se dedica a uno de los oficios m\u00e1s pintorescos y coloniales propios de la zona de Granada como es ser cochero brinda servicio de transporte lleva 10 a\u00f1os dedic\u00e1ndose a esta actividad.
