She is 38 years old, has eight children, and her husband is a security guard.  Her eldest son is 17 years old, the youngest is three, and all but the youngest are in school.  She has been running her business for 17 years.  She began with about $100 that she received from her husband.  She sells sugar, Omo soap, rice, etc.  She displays her merchandise in the central market of Virunga.  This loan will allow her to increase her turnover by purchasing ten bags of rice, five bags of Omo soap, etc.  The biggest challenge is that she sells in the national currency (Congolese francs).  Because this Congolese currency is not stable, she is subjected to more and more inflation, which leads to a loss in exchange with foreign currency (dollars).  She is like many Congolese who fear the Congolese franc and instead keep their savings in dollars.  She would like to buy a small plot of land on which to build for her children.  As a client, Mauwa M. thanks Hekima for its actions to help the poor citizens who are excluded from traditional banks. One should note that the Zamiri Group has 15 members.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Carolyn McMahon, Kiva

He's applied for a loan of 1000 AZN.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1250,"image":{"id":597925,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase one cow and two baby calves.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AZ","country":"Azerbaijan","town":"Imishli","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.869722 48.06","type":"point"}},"partner_id":56,"posted_date":"2010-09-12T06:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Elshad ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"AZN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":1250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":83.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.16},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.16},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.16},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.16},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.16},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.16},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.16},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.16},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.21}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":101.66,"local_amount":81.33,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:39:49Z","rounded_local_amount":81.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172066596,"comment":null},{"amount":105.69,"local_amount":84.55,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-02T10:59:18Z","rounded_local_amount":84.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177881080,"comment":null},{"amount":104.14,"local_amount":83.31,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-22T09:39:53Z","rounded_local_amount":83.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182802626,"comment":null},{"amount":105.16,"local_amount":84.13,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-19T09:22:59Z","rounded_local_amount":84.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189113574,"comment":null},{"amount":102.28,"local_amount":81.82,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T22:35:45Z","rounded_local_amount":82.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191532648,"comment":null},{"amount":103.38,"local_amount":82.7,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-19T08:05:01Z","rounded_local_amount":83.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196334105,"comment":null},{"amount":105.34,"local_amount":84.27,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-30T07:46:36Z","rounded_local_amount":84.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201229679,"comment":null},{"amount":103.08,"local_amount":82.46,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-17T07:52:44Z","rounded_local_amount":82.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206372457,"comment":null},{"amount":104.09,"local_amount":83.27,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-22T07:50:31Z","rounded_local_amount":83.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":212093051,"comment":null},{"amount":104.09,"local_amount":83.27,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:32:44Z","rounded_local_amount":83.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216449710,"comment":null},{"amount":211.09,"local_amount":168.89,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:15:30Z","rounded_local_amount":169.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221613835,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-09-19T23:20:07Z","paid_date":"2011-08-15T08:15:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":230102,"name":"Esperanza Asegurada 1 Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Berta is the coordinator of her group, Esperanza Asegurada 1 (Assured Hope).

She has had her business for two years, starting with selling girls underwear after she received her first loan with Esperanza. She plans to use this loan to invest in her business by buying clothing like shirts, pants, underwear and mens t-shirts. She will use the profits to buy a better stove for her home and also to save to reach her dream come true, in which she has her own home built with a good structure.\r\n \r\nThis Esperanza associate began with us because she has more facilities and, with them, she can maintain her business. Her story is representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican clients in general (many of whom recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti).  Her group is located in San Pedro de Macoris, a city famous for baseball players and the sugar cane industry.  The main economic activities are free trade and a cement factory. This area, like nearly all impoverished areas of the Dominican Republic, suffers from unreliable running water (none of which is potable) and

She is married and has eight children.  They live together in Quimbiri, located in Cusco's beautiful woods, where they have their own house. The most relevant thing for Astria is \"creativity and perseverance\"--a maxim she applies to her agricultural work.  That's how she cultivates coffee, which is the source of her income. She is able to harvest a large amount of coffee, and her customers are happy with the quality of her product. She normally works alongside her family, and they work together well.  There is also the additional savings in expenses, since there is no need to hire outside workers. She usually sells her coffee in distribution centers in her area and at a competitive price. Her daily routine is to leave home at 7 am and return at 6 pm.  She only rests on Sunday, when she can be with her family.  Her plans for the future are to increase her agricultural production so as to build a house with good materials so that her family can be safer and more comfortable.\r\n\r\nThis is her six loan with microfinance partner MFP, and she promises to meet her payment schedule.  She also would like to thank her community bank, where everyone is responsible for paying their respective loans.

In spite of having incomplete primary education, this was not an excuse to not continue with his dream to have his own business, and so he succeeded in cultivating and producing coffee. Now he has faithful buyers who always go to him for the high quality of this product. On the other hand, his ambition is to have an auto body shop, so he can obtain the necessary income to cover the basic needs of his family. It is because of this that he needs to work to generate the necessary capital to put into practice the workshop that he wants to open. Normally, he has the help of his family, who assist with the extraction and selection of his agricultural product, which is sold in the collection centers of their town. This is his sixth loan with MFP, for which he promises to continue following his payment schedule. He is satisfied with his communal bank, because of the good advantages it offers him. With the credit that he is asking for, he plans to buy fertilizer for the purpose of offering suitable protection for his coffee crop.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lauren Fischetti, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":597989,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Buy fertilizer to protect his coffee cultivations","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-09-11T15:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Feliciano ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:36:31Z","rounded_local_amount":1048.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201326961,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-09-12T20:15:16Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T11:36:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":230142,"name":"Roberto","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nEl socio pertenece al banco comunal \u201cKAROLL WOKTILA\u201d; Este banco est\u00e1 situado en el distrito de Huanchac perteneciente a la provincia de Cusco y departamento de Cusco.\n\nEl socio  Roberto, tiene 52 a\u00f1os de edad, el socio es conviviente y tiene 3 hijos, el socio trabaja en su propio negocio, el tiene una carpinter\u00eda en la calle Bolognesi, el socio desde hace 12 a\u00f1os trabaja en la carpinter\u00eda.

He is very happy about his success, and his sales have increased compared to the previous months as well. His wife generally works with in team with him, but for the harvest season he contracts laborers, in order to more easily crop his final products, that are to be sold to the local collection centers.

She has had her business for over five years, starting when she asked her father for the opportunity to sell seafood, buying it from him and other friends.

She will use the profits to invest in the education of her children and to have a bigger home.\r\n\r\nThis Esperanza associate began with us because she liked how the loans work, and she needed to invest in her business.

She plans to continue enjoying visiting the church and singing to the Lord.\r\n\r\nAna is excited to be taking her 9th loan with Esperanza after having successfully repaid her previous loan and increased her business. She has had her business for over 7 years, starting after she realized the need to earn extra incoming for her family. She plans to use this loan to invest in her business by buying pants, shirts, underwear and shoes. She will use the profits to buy some school supplies her children and to invest in her business. \r\n\r\nThis Esperanza associate began with us because a family group was formed in her community and invited her. She was in need of money to improve her sales and her  story is representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican  clients generally (many of whom recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti). Her group is located in the rural area surrounding Hato Mayor, an agricultural area. This area, like nearly all impoverished areas of the Dominican Republic suffers from unreliable running water (none of which is potable) and electricity.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4600,"image":{"id":598055,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

Oneida is well known for her friendly, trustworthy and accessible nature, which means that she is well liked, particularly by her customers as she has a clothes-selling business for ladies, men and children. Oneida started her business as she was looking for something that would increase her earnings whilst still being able to care for her children.\r\n\r\nOneida grew her business by \u201cselling small items\u201d, which she had bought on offer or discount, to neighbours and family members. Gradually, her perseverance, able management, and loans from the Fundaci\u00f3n allowed her to increase her income. This current loan from credikiva will be used to buy blouses, footwear, jeans and general men\u2019s, women\u2019s and children\u2019s clothing for the purposes of Valentine\u2019s Day, which is coming up and people wish to look nice and buy gifts for their partners and loved ones.   \r\n\r\nOneida\u2019s business has allowed her to improve her standard of living and turn her home into a pleasant environment. Initially her house started out as a plot of land but has gradually been improved upon. Oneida lives in a neighbourhood in the south of Barranquilla with her two children ages 21 and 25 years. She has managed to put her children through school using the loans provided by the Fundaci\u00f3n.\r\n\r\nOne of her children is a technician and the other is studying at a university. Oneida\u2019s dream is for her children to become fully professional in order to be able to compete in the job market. Oneida\u2019s most notable challenge is to continue to make ends meet but she is always keen to adopt new strategies to be able to build her client base and protect her earnings.      \r\n\r\n<br

Her group is located in the rural area surrounding Hato Mayor, an agricultural area. This area, like nearly all impoverished areas of the Dominican Republic suffers from unreliable running water (none of which is potable) and electricity.\r\n\r\nMargarita is excited to be taking her fifth loan with Esperanza after having successfully repaid her previous loan and grown her business. She has had her business for over four years, starting with some savings she had.  She plans to use this loan to invest in her business by buying bags of used clothing. She will use the profits to buy more bags and improve her business. She is also planning to save and buy a house to live with her family and stop paying rent.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1425,"image":{"id":598063,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used

She has had her business for two years, starting with a loan she took after a friend taught her to sell jewelry. She plans to use this loan to invest in her business by buying different kinds of silver jewelry.  She will use the profits to continue studying, and to improve her business. She dreams of having her own children and becoming a big family. \r\n\r\nThis Esperanza associate began with us because she likes the program and her business has been improving with the loans.  Her story is representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican clients generally (many of whom recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti).  Her group is located in L. Arcarrizos, a dusty industrial area north of the capital where free traD. zones are common.  This area, like nearly all impoverished areas of the Dominican Republic suffers from unreliable running water (none of which is potable) and

Women\u00b4s Bank \u00a8women Of Faith\u00a8 Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The name of this group translates as The Women\u00b4s Bank \u00a8Women of Faith.\u00a8 The nine women members live in Pococi, Limon, located in the Caribbean region of Costa Rica. \r\n\r\nThis will be the group's first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer. The members of this group were referred to Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer by an acquaintance in a nearby village who had had a positive experience with the organization in the past. The name of this group, \u00a8Women of Faith\u00a8 was chosen by the members and to them, it signifies that each member is a woman of faith  who is optimistic and confident that she will be successful in her endeavours.  These entrepreneurs feel that with hard work and dedication, they will have great success. \r\n\r\nDuring the Women\u00b4s Empowerment classes (which accompany the issuance of all loans granted from Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer to groups of this size), the members of this group displayed exceptional interest in learning how best to manage their micro-businesses. They have acquired skills that provide a solid foundation on which to launch a small business in a way to maximize revenue and reduce costs. Additionally, the women who have been elected to the Board of Directors (Secundina, Yorleny, Carmen and Angela) possess a wealth of knowledge  and experience acquired by working with  women\u00b4s groups. This wisdom will surely be valuable as this group moves forward. \r\n\r\nThe women of this group are involved mainly in two types of productive activities : pig rearing and the production of bread and tamales. Each individual member will receive 150,000 Colones  to invest in her business as she sees fit. The women involved in pig rearing will use this loan to purchase piglets as well as animal feed. The women involved in food production will use this loan to purchase raw materials necessary for bread and tamale production. Tamales are a staple Costa Rican food eaten all year round and especially around Christmas time.  \r\n\r\nSecundina B. C. is a 54-year-old mother of 5 who lives with her husband and two children in Pococi. She is also the elected president of this group. Secundina plans to use this loan to invest in ingredients to make bread and tamales which she will sell in her community. She starts selling her products in the street at 8 AM every day, and she works until everything is sold.  A main obstacle for Secundina and other members of this group has been a lack of access to working capital, the high cost of raw materials, and difficulty securing a consistent market for her (their) goods.  Secundina\u00b4s main goal is to secure a fixed market for her goods, so as to secure a steady flow of income and to allow her to spend more time producing goods instead of spending so much time selling her products in the street. \r\n\r\nSecundina admits there are advantages and disadvantages to the group lending model. She says that the model allows women who would otherwise be denied a loan, the ability to secure startup capital. This is because many women in the Pococi community do not know anyone with a constant salary who can act as a guarantor. This debilitating factor is overcome by the group model, whereby each member acts as a guarantor for other group members. Secundina notes that a disadvantage of her group is that she fears some of the members may have trouble repaying their loans, but she is nevertheless a \u00a8Woman of Faith.\u00a8 \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2650,"image":{"id":598078,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"For the purchase of piglets, animal feed, and raw materials for bread making.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Pococi, Limon","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":151,"posted_date":"2010-09-12T15:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Secundina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yorleny","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yajaira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leonor","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Grace","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ester","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":1350000,"loan_amount":2650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1350000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":2650,"local_amount":1350000,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-27T09:21:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1354971.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196970525,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-09-13T04:38:35Z","paid_date":"2011-03-27T09:21:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":230192,"name":"Cristo Salvador Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Sara es conviviente, tiene 40 a\u00f1os D. edad y forma parte del grupo \u201cCristo Salvador\u201d el cual lleva 8 a\u00f1os trabajando con edaprospo.

","en":"Nidia R. R. is a very wise woman who knows exactly what strategies to implement in every moment of her life; especially in regards to her business.  She started out selling gold jewelry, but when the price of gold rose, sales began to decline and profits fell, so she changed her merchandise.  The same customers that she had sold jewelry to, she started selling them vegetables such as lentils, beans, rice, and oil.  She gradually attracted more customers and more orders, creating a need for increased investment.  \r\n\r\nThus, seven years ago, Nidia went to the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, an organization that has supported her with four loans.  She succeeded in diversifying her products and improving timeliness to market.  For example, she sells pork on weekends, dairy products every day, and food supplies twice a week.\r\n\r\nWith all the support of FMSD, Nidia's discipline and interest in growing her business has improved all aspects of her life.  At 68 years old, she dreams of increasing sales volume and profits every day.  Competition is her main obstacle and she is always forced to use marketing strategies to hold on to her customers.  This is Nidia's fifth loan with FMSD.  She will buy rice, flour, powdered milk, pasta, toiletries, and vegetables to supply her business and increase her working capital.  With this loan, her dream of continued success will be realized.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Angela Yeh, Kiva

YANACOTO\r\n\r\nMember of ALCOM: \"SANTA ROSA OF YANACOTO\u201d whose members are progressive and hardworking with their own businesses. \r\n<p>\r\nCecilia began working since childhood with her mother who sold natural medicine in her homeland Hu\u00e1nuco. She married at the young age of 14 and began a grocery business. A few years later, with all she had learned, she decided to sell medicine, natural meiecine, and started applying her mother's knowledge of curing certain ailments such as respiratory tract diseases, muscle pain, and mild infections. At the same time she sold clothes and polos and it was then that she decided to move to Lima. This time she had to recommend herself since it was a new place. There was no competition for her business so she was able to implement more in merchandise with the loans she received from EDAPROSPO-PROSPERIDAD.  With the sales she was then able to have her own stand in a shopping center where her sales are very profitable. The secret is that besides Cecilia being a specialist in knowing every plant's healing property, she serves her community by helping the elders and does not charge them for remedies she prepares. This job helped her grow since she attended talks and conferences she was invited to. She had the opportunity to travel to Ecuador and the people she met there where medical therapists who enhanced her understanding. In turn, she was able to share with the medical specialists the healing  discoveries she maD. while treating her patients. Not only was she able to buy the land she owns and lives on, with this job she was also able to build it, acquire artifacts, and pay for her children's education. Many of her patients are professionals (lawyers, politicians, nurses, and doctors) and locals who are grateful for Cecilia being able to cure many of their diseases such as cancer, tumors, cysts, and myomas; but only when a surgical intervention is not necessary. If they do need surgery she tells her patients they should have it since she verifies it through x-rays and ultra sound scanning. She thanks God for having guided her to this path of helping people with much love through her knowledge. Her goal is to travel with medics in the United States so they can learn about and spread this form of healing.\r\n<p>\r\nThe loan she requests will be used to buy more syrups, herbs, and other natural healing medications.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Susan Garza, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1900,"image":{"id":598084,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Natural Medicines","sector":"Health","use":"To buy more syrups, herbs, and other natural healing medications.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chosica","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.943056 -76.709444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2010-09-14T15:58:00Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1900,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cristina Marlene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosario Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angelica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bonifacia Gregoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Blanca Gladys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benito Oswaldo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pamela Del Rosario","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cecilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":5250,"loan_amount":1900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1050},{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1050},{"due_date":"2010-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1050},{"due_date":"2011-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1050},{"due_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":1050}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":380},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":380},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":380},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":380},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":380}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":380,"local_amount":1050,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:36:18Z","rounded_local_amount":1062.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177390873,"comment":null},{"amount":380,"local_amount":1050,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:43:38Z","rounded_local_amount":1062.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182529153,"comment":null},{"amount":380,"local_amount":1050,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:52:22Z","rounded_local_amount":1062.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188665261,"comment":null},{"amount":760,"local_amount":2100,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:51:55Z","rounded_local_amount":2124.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191408517,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-09-15T12:02:16Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T02:51:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":230198,"name":"Aminata","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Aminata, who is married to an Arabic teacher and has two dependents, sells gara, a type of clothing.

In the meantime, she plans to continue enjoying learning new things.<p>\r\n\r\nMaria, who is excited to be taking her first loan with Esperanza, has had her business for a year and two months, having started with clothing sales which led to her establishing a small colmado (a general store with all the ingredients for one's daily food needs, conveniently located a short distance from any home in the neighborhood).  She plans to use this loan to invest in her business by buying a freezer for her colmado, and will use the profits  to pursue her life goals. <p>\r\n\r\nThis Esperanza associate began with us because she feels comfortable with the repayment schedule and likes to belong to a group, have the group meetings and save.

Her group is located in Puerto Plata, a port town on the north coast where the economy is based on tourism. This area, like nearly all impoverished areas of the Dominican Republic, suffers from unreliable running water (none of which is potable) and electricity.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1550,"image":{"id":598123,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

This is how Faride Carbon\u00f3 began her microbusiness \u201cMiscel\u00e1nea y variedades Fari\u201d (Fari's Variety and Miscellany).  She is a married woman with two children ages 9 and 12 who found her first customers doing manicures and pedicures, and at the same time she taught herself the art of costume jewelry through specialist magazines.  She then added this product to her business and later added sales of cell phone minutes; she was also supported by a friend who lives in the United States.  This friend sent her cosmetics merchandise and perfumes, and Faride sold them.  This was also how she added multi-use credits and gradually she has added many products like women's clothing and cosmetics.  In this manner, she has been growing and developing what she now has: a miscellany. \r\n\r\nHer Kiva loan is her first loan.  With it, she wants to obtain additional capital to buy products that her customers have requested and that would broaden the spectrum to other people who have never bought from her, such as ladies' jeans, perfumes, cosmetics and supplies for making costume jewelry.  Her dream is to increase her income through her work to leave something so her children have a promising future.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Danielle Maxson, Kiva

She lives with her husband and children in their own house. All her life she has been tied to the activities of the countryside. She works with her husband every day beginning in the early morning hours, when she takes their animals to graze in the meadows. At the same time, she raises olluco (a tuberous vegetable), potatoes, beans, and barley; her children help her with this activity. She states that over the years they have overcome difficulties such as frost. Once she has harvested her crops, she takes them to sell directly in the market in her town. In this way she generates the income that she needs. At this time she wants to improve her harvest and increase the number of animals that she has in her stable. This is her seventh loan with MFP. She is very happy to know that she has financial support, since she has always demonstrated that she is responsible with her payments. Furthermore, it makes her happy to be part of her community bank, because all its members are responsible and very united people. She is thankful to the people who will be granters of the loan she is applying for, which will be very useful in the progress of her business. With the loan that she is applying for, she will invest in the purchase of seeds and bags of fertilizer to plant potatoes, olluco, and alfalfa, since this last crop is indispensable for feeding her animals.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Pam McMurry, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":598129,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Buy seeds and fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-09-10T02:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Saturdina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:32:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1048.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216549409,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-09-10T03:30:02Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T11:32:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":230213,"name":"Fe En Dios 2 & 3 Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Felicia, the coordinator of her group Fe en Dios 2 & 3 (Faith in God), makes her home here in a simple structure with her husband and their two children.

She struggles every day to support them. \r\n\r\nShe sells undergarments of all kinds but the product that sells best is men's undergarments. She works every day at the bus station from 8am until 2pm. Some days she works from 12 noon until 8pm. She buys her merchandise in Picoaza where she acquires her items on credit and at a good price. Despite the economic crises her business has fared fairly well. \r\n\r\nShe has been a member of the community bank for the past 26 loan cycles and she enjoys it because the loans are very quickly. She is very grateful to Fundacion Espoir (Kiva Field Partner) for the support they have provided her. This loan will be used to increase her business, especially to purchase t-shirts, product that is always in high demand. \r\n\r\nHer dreams are to have a well stocked store equipped with display cases. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Erika Lindig, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":598176,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To purchase undergarments and t-shirts.

She is 49 years old. Imelda is the group leader of a 12-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nImelda is married and has 7 children. To make a living, Imelda owns & operates a business venture selling fruits and vegetables. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from vending fruits, vegetables, and snacks in the local community. Imelda has been engaged in her business for over 2 years and earns approximately 3000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Imelda joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Imelda has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Imelda is requesting a new loan of 7000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the 2nd loan taken out by Imelda from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

H. is now requesting a new loan of 9.632.000 VND that will be used to purchase additional products to sell.  The loan will be the 5th loan taken out by the borrower from SEDA.

\u0110\u1eb7ng Th\u1ecb (20201030023) is a 34-year-old female living in the town of huy\u1ec7n Y\u00ean Phong - t\u1ec9nh B\u1eafc Ninh.  She is married and has two school-aged children.  To make a living, H. owns and operates a specialized retail store.  The main source of income for the business comes from selling electronic products in the local community.  H. has been engaged in this business for over six years and earns approximately 3.000.000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2007, H. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  H. has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7.392.000 VND from SEDA.  The previous loan was used to purchase new equipment and tools to expand the business.  H. is now requesting a new loan of 9.632.000 VND which will be used to purchase additional products to sell.  This loan will be the 5th loan taken out by the H. from SEDA.  H. plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to expand her business.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout SEDA:\r\n\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to the low income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the Northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n\r\nH. \u0110\u1eb7ng Th\u1ecb (20201030023) l\u00e0 34 tu\u1ed5i n\u1eef.

The majority of the members live in the state of Hidalgo. The group has 10 members. \r\n\r\nMaribel N. R. is the president of the group. She is 26, a single mom, finished her 3rd year of high school, is a secretary and has two children (1 boy, 1 girl). She has a catalog sales business. Maribel has been selling footwear for a year and is requesting a loan to purchase new catalogs and so increase her sales. The sales will help her save up to rent a shop and develop her business and meet her family's needs without having to go far to work. \r\n\r\nHer customers tell us that Maribel is an excellent saleswoman who makes house calls to her neighbors. She is hardworking and polite with her coworkers, has an excellent disposition, and loves what she does. \r\n\r\nAs she requests this loan Maribel is very happy for the opportunity she is getting since the extra income from shoe sales will allow her to take her children on vacation to Acapulco. That would fulfill her kids' dreams. \r\n\r\nMaria Gaudalupe R. J. is the group's treasurer. She is 26, and finished grade school. She lives in a common-law marriage with three children (10, 6 and 3). She has a business selling woven bags with decorations in stone and metal chips that she started 8 years ago. She is requesting a loan to purchase more raw material like thread and colored metal chips as well as higher quality stones thus hopefully selling more in the future. \r\n\r\nCurrently she heads to other towns to sell her goods. At first she only sold to friends and family but little by little she she expanded her market in Tizayuca. Her customers say that she is polite, offers good service, a good variety of products, as well as flexible payment terms (weekly or all at once) depending on her customers' needs. As she requests her loan she feels supported  and that she has a chance to get her family ahead aside from helping her husband with the household expenses. Since she is of modest means she feels more confidence going forward, and with her parents' support, to improve the quality of her goods. \r\n\r\nThe members of the group are as follows:\r\nMaribel N.

This business is called Body Strong, and it is a gym that she started when her husband retired from the police. She made good use of her studies in the gymnastic skills institute and put them into service for the community and little by little invested in the infrastructure and has been operating the gym since 2006. The gym is an additional income source for her to help her children take courses at the university.

She makes her home here in a simple structure with her three children. She says that her most difficult challenge is to redecorate her house.  In the meantime she plans to continue enjoying cooking.\r\n\r\nRegina is excited to be taking her second loan with Esperanza after having successfully repaid her previous loan and grown her business. She has had her business for 5 months, starting with her first Esperanza loan. She plans to use this loan to invest in her business by buying women's and men's deodorants and all kinds of cream, especially face cream for women. She also sells bread and ice at her house (people in our villages buy Ice because not everybody has a refrigerator or electricity is not consistent). She will use the profits to redecorate her house and she is planning to build a new bathroom. She dreams of living comfortably in a good house. \r\n\r\nThis Esperanza associate began with us because she planned to start a business but she need money to start it up. Her  story is representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican clients (many of whom recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti) generally. Her group is located in Samana, a lush rugged peninsula with a nascent tourism industry. This area, like nearly all impoverished areas of the Dominican Republic, suffers from unreliable running water (none of which is potable) and inconsistent electricity.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4025,"image":{"id":598383,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products

From her childhood she has farmed, as it was her main source of income. The products that she cultivates the most are potatoes and corn. After about 6 months there is a harvest, for which she requires the help of labourers to facilitate the extraction of these products. She is very happy doing this work because she considers herself to be a capable and independent person. She wants to expand her land in order to cultivate more crops and increase production.

Caribbean region of Costa Rica. The group was formed at the beginning of 2007; however, this will be the members' first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer. The loan consultant who has been working with this group has described the members as hardworking entrepreneurs with the desire and ability to improve the standard of living for themselves as well as their families. A major limiting factor for the women of this group has been a lack of access to working capital. This loan will help to address this problem. \r\n\r\nThe members of this group are involved in agricultural activities such as the rearing and sale of animals. Specifically, this loan will be used to finance the purchase of livestock such as pigs, chickens and cows as well as animal feed. \r\n\r\nAna\u00eds F. Vald\u00e9z is a 41-year-old mother of five who lives with her partner and two sons. Ana\u00eds is the elected president of this group. She has a business rearing and selling cows. She plans to use this loan to buy a calf and, if there is money left over, some honey and salt. Ana\u00eds starts her day in the following manner: she wakes up early at 3:45 AM to tend to the animals on her plot of land. After feeding the animals and cleaning out their pens, at around 5:30 AM, Ana\u00eds prepares breakfast for her two children and husband and cleans the house. Ana\u00eds has the goal of increasing her production levels in terms of the amount of livestock she sells. She would like to increase her income in order to augment her own standard of living as well as that of her family. \r\n\r\nWith respect to her fellow group members, Ana\u00eds explains that she knows them all very well, as the members are mostly neighbors who have lived in the same community for a very long time. The name of this group, \"Women of Power\", is derived from the power the members find in their personal faith. These members feel that their faith will drive them forward unconditionally. Ana\u00eds explains that the group lending model is beneficial because it allows women peers to act as loan guarantors for each other, without collateral or proof of a salary. The disadvantage is that each person may become responsible for another person\u2019s inability to make repayments or the failure of another person\u00b4s business.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":598115,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"For the purchase of livestock and animal feed","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Pococi, Limon","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":151,"posted_date":"2010-09-12T23:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana\u00eds","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jeannette","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marianna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maritza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":600000,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":600000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1200,"local_amount":600000,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-27T09:21:51Z","rounded_local_amount":605387.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196970527,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-09-14T18:33:55Z","paid_date":"2011-03-27T09:21:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":230367,"name":"Aristides","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ar\u00edstides, de 55 a\u00f1os, vive a lado de su esposo Heraclio de 56 a\u00f1os y de su hija mayor de los 6 que tiene en total, pues el resto viven independientes con sus propias familias.

He is married to Mrs. Maria Victoria and they had 4 children. Sadly, they have had very painful times in their lives as 3 of their children died.  The last child was 8 years old and died of an aneurysm; the other two died before birth.\r\n\r\nHe is a driver and worked in Coronel Oviedo for a soda and beer distribution company for 6 years.  In 1985, they sent him to mange the company\u2019s Canindeyu branch where he remained for 14 years.  At that time, he had purchased a tandem axle truck and a small truck with a 5,000 kilo cargo capacity in order to make his own deliveries.  And so it was for some years.  \r\n\r\nThen his son became ill and was hospitalized and he accumulated many expenses.  They were not able to find a cure and he died in 1993.  As he still had many debts, he decided to sell one of his trucks and the house that he had in the center of Coronel Oviedo.  This led him to seek other resources and relocate to the other side of the city.  Then he prepared cigars made from tobacco leaves for sale in Asuncion where he began to gain a market for his product.  Since he was traveling back and forth to the city to sell his products, he decided to move there.   When he first arrived, he lived in a tenement.  Later, he bought his own land in the city of Villa Elisa where he now lives.\r\n\r\nHe continues making and selling cigars in various parts of the city.  Four years ago, he added the purchase and sale of furniture on order to his micro-business which he says gives him a good profit. He is even able to work from his home and rarely needs to go out.  He is requesting the loan to buy furniture and tobacco leaves for making cigars.\r\n\r\nHe is very happy with the loans he has received. They are a very important source of funds for the purchase of his merchandise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Eleanor Francoletti-Putz, Kiva

Alicia has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 1,500 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, Alicia joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from PMPC which was used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in future. Alicia is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This will be the twelfth loan that Alicia has taken out from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in north-western Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Domingo has been engaged in his business for over 34 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nDomingo joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and his ability to engage in business activities. He has successfully repaid a previous loan of 27,000 PHP from ASKI. Domingo is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. This will be the third loan that Domingo has taken out from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to save as a reserve for future emergencies. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

Unfortunately, pensions in rural areas are low and people need to find an additional means of subsistence to live on. For this reason, Shamshibek\u2019s family decided to engage in cattle breeding. \r\n\r\nAs Shamshibek was born into a farmer\u2019s family and had wide experience in animal breeding, he started this activity with great enthusiasm. He used his initial capital of only 5,000 soms (KGS) to buy cattle and managed to increase the number. Also, Shamshibek began to cultivate sunflowers and perennial herbs which serve as concentration of forage for his cattle. With the revenue, Shamshibek gave a good education to his children which allowed them to successfully manage their lives. \r\n\r\nNow Shamshibek plans to use this loan of 80,000 KGS to buy more cattle for fattening and reselling.

It is an association of motorbike taxi drivers who work together and guarantee each other's loans. C\u00e9lestin and his group work hard to provide for their families and improve their living conditions. A few of them were able to build their house. C\u00e9lestin, too, is a motard (the name of motorbike taxi drivers in Rwanda). He wants to start the construction of his house. The group did take out a loan from Amasezerano Community Banking to buy spare parts for their motorbikes and also to bolster the businesses of their wives. The group members are used to save regularly some money to secure their future.\r\n\r\nNB: The group is made up of twelve members. Only ten are pictured, because two of them were sick.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Robert Mouris, Kiva

She is 38 years old and is the group leader of a 3-member group loan offered by PMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. \r\n\r\nMaria Benjie is married and has 4 school-aged children. To make a living, she plants, harvests and sells rice in the local community. She has been engaged in her business for over 8 years and earns approximately $47 a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Maria Benjie joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 14,500 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used as additional capital for the business. She is requesting a new loan of 14,500 PHP which will be used to purchase fertilizer for the farm. This will be her 6th loan from PMPC.  \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":598585,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To

"Samwel

All of his children currently attending school.\r\n\r\nSamwel recently repaid his second loan from Juhudi Kilimo. Now he is applying for a third loan, for 70,000 KES, to buy a cow. He says that the extra income made possible by this loan will help him pay his children's school fees.
