J. lives in Jalollidini Rumy. She is a widow. She lives with her four children. After her husband\u2019s death, she had to start working to provide for her children. She works in the local market. She trades in spare parts for cars. She has been doing this for eight years, but all of her profit is spent on food, and there is nothing left for business development.  Since she learned that getting a loan is possible, she decided to take out a loan for 3500 somoni.  This loan will help to increase sales and to increase the assortment of goods she offers.  Her income will increase, and she will be able to develop her business.  She plans to pay off the loan in 12 months.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Melissa, Kiva

So she started her business in October of 2006.  One time when she dropped her children off at school, she realized that the vendors that were at the school entrance were selling a lot, and it occurred to her to do this outside of her house, and so one day she took out a small table with some candies and fried snacks, and the people passing by began to buy.  She liked it, and little by little she was investing in more products and later put in a shelf with fried snacks of a well-known brand name and now has a good selection.

H. is a 23-year-old young man who lives with his family in Ningarhar province. He is married and has two children. They are small and don't go to school yet.  Omar lives with his brothers at one home and they support their family together.  Omar is illiterate but he admires educated people. He thus advises his brothers to care more about their studying and to work hard.\r\n<p>\r\nOmar H. has been working as a farmer for the last several years on his own land. He doesn't have a lot of land but he is a very active and hardworking man.  He grows wheat, tomatoes, eggplants, and other different kinds of vegetables.  He takes them to the marketplace for sale.  Actually his current income is just 300 Afghanis ($6) a day and it's too little to suffice for his household expenditures.\r\n<p> \r\nOmar says that he has fertile land in an area close to the city which is a great benefit logistically.  But he is in need of cash to purchase seeds and fertilizers. He has therefore applied for a 30,000 Afghanis loan.\r\n<p>\r\nOmar H. hopes that after a few months he will see a lot of positive changes in his business and thus in his family conditions.  He is also dreaming about enrolling his brothers in private educational schools which are much better than public schools.  He promised that he will repay this loan in 24 months in a timely

a 24-year-old married man.

He therefore began a small business. \r\n<p>\r\nFirst, Muhammad made a small retail store in Jalalabad City and with the little capital that he had, he purchased some basic goods.  Initially, his business went well and he attracted plenty of regular customers in short while.  However, after a few months, because of skyrocketing costs of living, the retail store no longer sufficed for the household expenses.  Gradually, he was losing customers because there were not enough goods in the shop.\r\n <p>\r\nBut now he is looking for a 50,000 Afghanis loan to stand on his feet once more.  He intends to purchase various goods for his shop and increase the number of his customers once again.  His shop has a good location in the market and that is definitely a plus.\r\n<p>\r\nMuhammadU. hopes to become a great businessman in the future.  He works hard to achieve that goal.

Usaha yang dijalani oleh Juliana sehari-hari adalah sebagai penjual nasi bungkus. Pada pagi hari dia harus berangkat ke Pasar untuk belanja kabutuhan jualan, seperti sayur dan ikan atau daging ayam. Setelah itu dia pulang dan mulai memasak. Sampai sore dia menjajakan jualannya dengan berkeliling, atau menitipkan diwarung lain dengan membayar sesuai banyaknya nasi yang terjual. Untuk biaya hidup sehari-harinya, dia menghabiskan sekitar 20.000. Oleh karena itu dia harus bisa mendapatkan penghasilan bersih dalam satu hari lebih dari 20.000. Rencananya pinjaman kali akan dipakai sebagai modal tambahan untuk usahanya. Diharapkan, keuntungan yang didapat bisa dipakai untuk menyekolahkan anaknya."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":188418,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"To add working capital (Menambah Modal Usaha)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Badung","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.5 115.333333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2008-08-08T01:40:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-08-22T03:41:31Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":1000000,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":13,"local_amount":104000,"processed_date":"2008-09-22T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-29T07:22:35Z","rounded_local_amount":118732.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":334319,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":12,"local_amount":96000,"processed_date":"2008-10-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-11-16T08:42:01Z","rounded_local_amount":109599.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":368753,"comment":"scheduled_repayment (late autopay posting for DINARI Foundation - Oct 22, 2008)"},{"amount":12.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-11-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T21:07:47Z","rounded_local_amount":114165.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5308516,"comment":null},{"amount":12.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-12-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-22T08:55:51Z","rounded_local_amount":114165.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9925442,"comment":null},{"amount":12.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-01-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-07T09:02:14Z","rounded_local_amount":114165.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14849740,"comment":null},{"amount":12.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-02-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-18T08:04:03Z","rounded_local_amount":114165.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20389178,"comment":null},{"amount":12.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-03-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T17:45:46Z","rounded_local_amount":114165.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27080584,"comment":null},{"amount":12.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T15:22:23Z","rounded_local_amount":114165.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35973810,"comment":null},{"amount":12.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T22:29:40Z","rounded_local_amount":114165.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44434512,"comment":null},{"amount":12.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-06-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:06:07Z","rounded_local_amount":114165.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52945048,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-08-08T03:41:31Z","paid_date":"2009-07-15T20:06:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":58337,"name":"Mai","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Mai V., a widowed resident of  Prerak Takeo Village in Kandal Province, is a grocer in the local market.

Her story is just one of a list of men and women who are improving their quality of life through the help of micro-credit loans of Esperanza. Together, this group has united with a common vision of a better life with faith and hope in their hearts and an unbreakable spirit. The concept of group lending is to have loans paid in a group to reduce the risk of a person defaulting, as others pick up where a person may lag to receive the next loan. Each of the associates in this bank has a similar business whether it is a motor taxi service or selling clothing.

Her business specializes in seafood, but when asked what she enjoys eating most she says, \u201cMe gusta toda\u201d (I like everything). She is an avid churchgoer and a firm believer in Christ. In the future, Mrs. N. M. hopes to see her business grow and move forward to provide for herself and her young children.\r\n<p>Mrs. N. M. is a member of a 7 person group, Group 1, which is part of a larger micro-bank called La Revolucion, \"The Revolution\" in English. In the picture, Mrs. N. M. is in third from the right in the back with a blue shirt on along with members of her group and some others of La Revolucion. Her story is just one of a list of men and women who are improving their quality of life through the help of micro-credit loans of Esperanza. Together, this group has united with a common vision of a better life with faith and hope in their hearts and an unbreakable spirit. The concept of group lending is to have loans paid in a group to reduce the risk of a person defaulting, as others pick up where a person may lag to receive the next loan.

He was introduced to farming by friends.\r\n\r\n\r\nElias became a member of GHAPE in 2001 and has borrowed and repaid loans five times, totaling $730. He invested these loans in raising poultry, fish farming, and growing crops like cassava. The profit of these loans was used to pay school fees, send his son to learn a trade, dig fish ponds and pay a dowry for his son\u2019s wife. \r\n\r\n\r\nElias is requesting a loan of $600. He plans to use this loan to increase his fish farm by digging more ponds and adding more fish. He also intends to grow crops like cassava, maize and corn. He is convinced that his business is going to be successful because he has experience in the business and enough land for farming. In addition, demand for fish in his community is very high, especially during the Christmas season. He plans to use the profit from this loan to build a house for his family, pay school fees, pay his son\u2019s apprentice fee, and provide other basic needs for the family. \r\n\r\n\r\nHe has 24 months to repay this loan and the first repayment installment begins on the fourth month after disbursement.

He was left with no other option but to do odd jobs, and try to save money to learn a trade.\r\n\r\nHe saw the need for his children to have good education after losing his job, so he became a member of GHAPE in 2005. He believes that GHAPE can help him achieve his ambitions in life. Peter has already been able to receive and manage loans totaling $120. The profit from these loans was used to educate his children by buying books, uniforms, paying school fees. The standard of living of his family has also changed, and they are now able to eat three square meals a day. \r\n\r\nPeter is requesting a new loan of $500 to continue with his poultry farming,  pig farming, and farming of crops like cassava. He would also like to add honey production. Peter greatly believes that he will succeed because he is the only person in his area who is producing honey, which would be in high demand. He is also the sole supplier of poultry and pigs in his area. The profit of this loan will be used to construct a better house for his family, educate his children, and expand his business.\r\n\r\nHe plans to repay this loan in 18 months and the first

Her dream has been realized thanks to her hard work and the loans she received to start up her business.<p>\r\n\r\nLiliana and her neighbors and friends formed the group named Rosa M\u00edstica, and together they took out a loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Paraguaya through its program \u201cCommittee of Women Entrepreneurs\u201d.  Like Liliana, the other women in the group work at the same time as raising their families.  Each is engaged in a different activity: some women work as traveling vendors, some sell food, and  some own \u201cdespensas\u201d (mini-markets), while others produce artisan textiles to sell.<p>\r\n\r\nRosa M\u00edstica is a very united, hard-working group whose members, in addition to their work activities, perform community work and raise funds to invest in the betterment of their neighborhood.<p>\r\n\r\nThese women would like a loan in order to buy merchandise to sell\u2014merchandise such as meat, fruit, vegetables, drinks, cosmetics, stockings, fabric, thread, and knitting needles.\r\n<p><b> Translated by Melissa Hays, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>  \r\n\r\nEste Comit\u00e9 se formo gracias a la Sra.

Lo interesante es que ponen el pan en canastos que lo cargan en la cabeza y van a vender de casa en casa! Otras se\u00f1oras trabajan en la elaboraci\u00f3n de fajas de mostacilla. Tambi\u00e9n hay una clienta que con sus pr\u00e9stamos se pudo comprar una m\u00e1quina de confecci\u00f3n. Finalmente, hay una se\u00f1ora que cr\u00eda animales, pollos y cerdos para su venta. \r\n\r\n<P>Este grupo es especial y creo que debemos acompa\u00f1arlos y apoyarlos, y ustedes con su apoyo van a poder darle la oportunidad de superarse."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1675,"image":{"id":185960,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","use":"To buy supplies

This place is known in the area for the great agricultural production that it has. Many merchants come to Concepci\u00f3n to buy vegetables, for the most part, biweekly. The peasants plant onions, carrots, and cabbage among other vegetables. Because of the work that they put in to the land, the peasants have designed strategies to maintain the fertility of the soil. For example, in Concepci\u00f3n, the practice of rotating the type of vegetable to be planted in the same space of land for much of the year is widely used. Basic techniques like those mentioned minimize the risk of farming for the group members. \r\n<p> The Chuiquisis group has been together for almost four years. They have already had four loans with this institution. This group is very good with re-payments, since the members are very responsible. If this is not the case, at the end of the loan, the group separates from the person that has not been responsible. In this way, the reputation of the group has remained intact. The women say that the success of the group lies in the responsibility of each woman and in the fact that they choose well at the time of making the group.\r\n<p> All of the women in this group work in the agricultural sector. In their plots, the women plant the traditional vegetables of the area. They use their loan to buy seeds, fertilizer, and to rent the land. \r\n<p>Another positive aspect that this female group has is that all the women believe in the power of education. The members try to send all of their children to school, at least to primary school. This attitude is very positive, since it demonstrates a great improvement between the generations of the parents and the children.\r\n<p> The Chuiquisis Group is made up of a group of working women that want to go forward with their families. As a result, we have to extend them a hand by means of a loan that will help them to drive their businesses and to generate more profits that will allow them to invest in their children. \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by A. Shah, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n<P>Las mujeres Chuiquisis provienen de un pueblo muy rural en el departamento de Solol\u00e1 llamado Concepci\u00f3n.  Este lugar es conocido en el medio por la gran producci\u00f3n agr\u00edcola que tiene. A Concepci\u00f3n llegan muchos comerciantes a comprar verduras al por mayor quincenalmente. Los campesinos siembran cebollas, zanahorias, repollo entre otras verduras. Los campesinos debido a la presi\u00f3n que ejercen a la tierra han dise\u00f1ado estrategias para mantener la fertilidad de la tierra. Por ejemplo, en Concepci\u00f3n es ampliamente practicada la t\u00e9cnica de rotaci\u00f3n de cultivo as\u00ed como var\u00edar el tipo de vegetales que van a sembrar en un mismo espacio de tierra a lo largo del a\u00f1o. T\u00e9cnica b\u00e1sicas como las mencionadas minimizan el riesgo del cultivo para las clientes.\r\n\r\n<P>El grupo Chuiquisis lleva junto por casi cuatro a\u00f1os. Ellas ya han trabajado cuatro cr\u00e9ditos con la instituci\u00f3n. Este grupo ha sido de muy buena paga ya que las integrantes son muy responsables, y cuando no lo son, al final del cr\u00e9dito separan a la persona que ha faltado con la instituci\u00f3n. De esta manera la reputaci\u00f3n del grupo se mantiene intacta. Las se\u00f1oras comentaron que el \u00e9xito del grupo yace en la responsabilidad de cada mujer y que se escogieron muy bien a la hora de formar el grupo.\r\n\r\n<P>Todas las se\u00f1oras de este grupo trabajan en el sector agr\u00edcola. En sus terrenos ellas siembran los vegetales tradicionales del \u00e1rea. Ellas utilizan su cr\u00e9dito para la compra de semillas, abono, fertillizante y algunas lo utilizan para el alquiler de la tierra. \r\n\r\n<P>Otro factor muy positivo que tienen este grupo de se\u00f1oras es que todas ellas creen en el poder de la educaci\u00f3n. Las clientes tratan de env\u00edar a todos sus hijos a la escuela, por lo menos a la escuela primaria. Esta actitud es muy positivo ya que demuestra una gran mejora generacional entre padre e hijos. \r\n\r\n<P>El grupo Chuiquisis est\u00e1 conformado por un grupo de mujeres trabajadoras que quieren salir adelante junto con sus familias, es por eso que nosotros tenemos que extenderles una mano por medio de un pr\u00e9stamo que las va a ayudar a impulsar sus negocios y generar mayores ganancias

This town is situated among the green mountains that surround Atitl\u00e1n Lake. Santa Clara is known for the production of beautiful baskets and bread. \r\n<p> Clare\u00f1as is a long-standing group. They have been working with the same communal bank for almost nine years. The values that The Friendship Bridge tries to communicate to all of its clients have already been internalized for the members of Clare\u00f1as.\r\n<p>The members of this group are involved in a variety of businesses. For example, one client is a baker. She has an oven inside her house where she makes the bread that she will sell at the store and in neighboring towns. Two others work as animal breeders. They breed chickens and pigs for sale. Another woman is known for producing natural hams, which, surprisingly, are black. The group also includes a merchant, who buys and sells rice and beans. Both foods are considered to be essential in the diet of the indigenous population in rural Guatemala. Finally, one woman sells tamales in the market. \r\n<p> The truth is that these businesswomen are very versatile. The women pursue more than one activity; when they notice that the sale of one good is low, they invest their loan into other activities. For example, the women that breed animals realized that the price of animal feed had risen, so they began to embroider pretty flowers on traditional blouses in Santa Clara. \r\n<p> The members of the Clare\u00f1as Group have been receiving training as part of their association with The Friendship Bridge. They paid a great deal of attention to the training that dealt with how to manage money, since the women could learn some tools that to help their businesses grow. \r\n<p>The group members feel comfortable working with The Friendship Bridge and with the methods of communal banks because they don\u2019t have many requirements for clients seeking a loan. In addition, the installments of the loans also designed to satisfy the needs of this sector of the market. Finally, one of the clients commented that she appreciates that their group only includes women, because they feel more comfortable to express themselves and be more open in their group. \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by A. Shah, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nLas Clare\u00f1as provienen de un bello pueblo llamado Santa Clara la laguna. Dicho pueblo queda entre las verdes monta\u00f1as que rodean el lago Atitl\u00e1n. Santa Clara es conocido por la producci\u00f3n de bellas canastas y la producci\u00f3n de pan. \r\n\r\n<P>Las Clare\u00f1as es un grupo ya consolidado. Ellas han venido trabajando en el mismo banco comunal ya por casi nueve a\u00f1os gracias a esto, los valores que The Friendship Bridge trata de transmitir a todas sus clientas ya han sido interiorizado por ellas. \r\n\r\n<P>En este grupo uno puede encontrar una variedad de empresarias. Por ejemplo una cliente es panadera. Ella tiene un horno dentro de su casa donde ella produce el pan que va a vender al mercado y a pueblos aleda\u00f1os. Otras dos trabajan en la crianza de animales. Ellas cr\u00edan pollos y cerdos para la venta. Otra se\u00f1ora es conocida por producir jabones naturales, lo sorprendente es que son de color negro. Tambi\u00e9n podemos encontrar una clienta comerciante, ella compra y vende ma\u00edz y fr\u00edjol. Ambos alimentos son considerados esenciales en la dieta de los pobladores ind\u00edgenas de las \u00e1reas rurales de Guatemala. Finalmente, una se\u00f1ora se encargada de vender tamales en el mercado. \r\n\r\n<P>La verdad es que estas empresarias son muy vers\u00e1tiles. Ellas no solo se dedican a un solo negocio, cuando las se\u00f1oras notan que la venta est\u00e1 baja tienden a invertir su cr\u00e9dito en otras actividades. Por ejemplo, las se\u00f1oras que cr\u00edan animales se dan cuenta que el precio del alimento para animales ha incrementado, ellas empiezan a bordar bellas flores en las blusas tradicionales de Santa Clara. \r\n\r\n<P>Las Clare\u00f1as han venido recibiendo una variedad de capacitaciones de parte de la instituci\u00f3n. Las capacitaciones que m\u00e1s le llamaron la atenci\u00f3n fue la de \u201cc\u00f3mo administrar mi dinero\u201d, ya que las se\u00f1oras pudieron aprender algunas herramientas que van a hacer que su negocio crezca. \r\n\r\n<P>Las Clare\u00f1as se sienten c\u00f3modas trabajando con The Friendship Bridge y la metodolog\u00eda de bancos comunales porque a la hora de solicitar un cr\u00e9dito se les pide a las clientes muy pocos requisitos. Adem\u00e1s los plazos de los pr\u00e9stamos est\u00e1n dise\u00f1ados para satisfacer las necesidades de este sector del mercado. Finalmente, una de las clientes coment\u00f3 que les gusta trabajar bajo esta metodolog\u00eda porque son solo mujeres y de esa manera ellas se sienten m\u00e1s c\u00f3modas de expresarse y

Group","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"<p> The majority of the women that make up the Trixana Group come from a beautiful town called San Andr\u00e9s Semetabaj. San Andr\u00e9s is situated in the Atitl\u00e1n region. The people of this beautiful place are fortunate enough to wake up every day and admire the beauty of Atitl\u00e1n Lake. San Andr\u00e9s is also known for being a traditional town that conserves its values, but is also developing. \r\n<p> The members of Trixana are a group of women who are learning to manage credit. This is the second loan that they have requested. They are asking for this loan for many reasons. First, this is the first time that they have access to a loan so easily; for them to qualify, it is enough that they are a group of women, that they agree to stick together to repay the loan, and that they have a photocopy of a government-issued identity document. Second, they are requesting another loan because they benefitted from the first one. They said that thanks to the previous loan, they were able to buy more raw materials, which permitted them to make more profits.\r\n<p> Apparently in the micro-finances, especially with new clients, being able to buy a more merchandise and generating more profits is something that rarely happens. Because of this, their success is remarkable. \r\n<p> The members of Trixana work in different industries. Most of the women work in the textiles industry; they knit traditional blouses called \u201chuililes.\u201d Also, two women have a tortilla shop. This business has profits because tortillas have an inelastic demand in rural Guatemala. There are also women that work in a variety of businesses, such as cultivating flowers and corn, selling beans and rice, and looking after a store. A plot of land, that 8 years ago cost Q250.00 to rent, now costs Q800.00, according to Alicia C..\r\n<p> Am\u00e9rica C. said that she likes working with The Friendship Bridge because of the training that she receives, especially that of her rights as a woman. Now, thanks to this training, she knows her rights as a woman. We feel very satisfied with this. Your support will contribute enormously with the development of this Guatemalan town.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by A. Shah, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n<P>Las mujeres que conforman el grupo Trixana en su mayor\u00eda provienen de un bello pueblo llamado San Andr\u00e9s Semetabaj. San Andres queda en la regi\u00f3n de Atitl\u00e1n. Los pobladores de este bello lugar tienen la fortuna de levantarse todos los d\u00edas y admirar la belleza del lago Atitl\u00e1n. San Andr\u00e9s tambi\u00e9n es conocido por ser un pueblo tradicional que conserva sus valores pero que tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1 desarrollando.       \r\n\r\n<P>Las Trixanas son un grupo de mujeres que est\u00e1 aprendiendo a manejar el cr\u00e9dito. Este cr\u00e9dito que van a solicitar es el segundo en su vida. Ellas est\u00e1n solicitando este cr\u00e9dito por muchas razones: primero, es la primera vez que tienen acceso a un pr\u00e9stamo tan f\u00e1cil, solo basta un grupo de mujeres, una garant\u00eda solidaria y una fotocopia del documento nacional de identidad. Segundo, porque les fue bien en su cr\u00e9dito anterior. Ellas comentaron que gracias al pr\u00e9stamo anterior fueron capaces de comprar una mayor cantidad de materia prima lo cual les permiti\u00f3 generar m\u00e1s ganancias. \r\n\r\n<P>Al parecer en las micro finanzas, especialmente con clientes nuevas, lograr poder comprar un poco m\u00e1s de mercader\u00eda y generar un poco m\u00e1s de ganancias es un evento que las clientes nunca esperaron lograr. Es por eso, en parte, porque las microfinanzas es un \u00e9xito alrededor del mundo.\r\n\r\n<P>Las Trixanas trabajan en distintas industrias. En su mayor\u00eda las mujeres trabajan en el \u00e1rea textil, ellas tejen blusas tradicionales llamadas huipiles. Luego, dos mujeres tienen una tortiller\u00eda. Este negocio no tiene pierde, ya que las tortillas tiene una demanda inel\u00e1stica en el \u00e1rea rural de Guatemala. Luego, hay mujeres que trabajan en una variedad de negocios como el cultivo de flores, ma\u00edz, venta de frijol y ma\u00edz y atienden una tienda. Hace ocho a\u00f1os alquilar cinco cuerdas de tierra (25m x 25m) costaba Q250.00 el d\u00eda de hoy alquilar la misma cantidad de tierras cuesta Q800.00 seg\u00fan comentaba Alicia C.. \r\n\r\n<P>Am\u00e9rica C. coment\u00f3 que le gustaba trabajar con The Friendship Bridge por las capacitaciones que recib\u00eda, especialmente la de los derechos de la mujer. Ahora, gracias a estas capacitaciones, ella est\u00e1 segura de sus derechos como mujer. Nosotros como instituci\u00f3n nos sentimos muy satisfechos con esto y usted gracias a su apoyo van a contribuir enormemente con el desarrollo del pueblo Guatemalteco."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3275,"image":{"id":185968,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","use":"To buy thread, corn to make tortillas, supplies for the stores, and rice and beans.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"San Andres, Solola","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.75 -91.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":55,"posted_date":"2008-08-07T21:20:25Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Francisca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"America","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lidia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Manuela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Santa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Micaela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hilda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gloria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-08-22T19:45:19Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":24500,"loan_amount":3275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1884.62},{"due_date":"2008-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1884.62},{"due_date":"2008-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1884.62},{"due_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1884.62},{"due_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1884.62},{"due_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1884.62},{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1884.62},{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1884.62},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1884.62},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1884.62},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1884.62},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1884.62},{"due_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1884.56}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":251.92},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":251.92},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":251.92},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":251.92},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":251.92},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":251.92},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":251.92},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":251.92},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":251.92},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":251.92},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":251.92},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":251.92},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":251.96}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":252,"local_amount":1885.19,"processed_date":"2008-09-22T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-11-01T07:12:13Z","rounded_local_amount":1893.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":334381,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":252,"local_amount":1885.19,"processed_date":"2008-10-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-11-22T08:08:02Z","rounded_local_amount":1893.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":368810,"comment":"scheduled_repayment (late autopay posting for Friendship Bridge -

Amadou W. is 41 years old and lives with his two children in his father\u2019s house with his extended family in the Massablacoura quarter in the city of Bougouni (Bougoni Prefecture in Mali). Coming from a Diawanbe family (an ethnic group which is very skilled in business in West Africa), he never went to school because his father was always moving. After a period of apprenticeship in the techniques of business, he decided to start a business selling hooved animals, notably cattle. Mr. W. has been doing this for 15 years and is an expert in this field. In order to obtain additional financial help, he visited the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso, where he just got his first individual loan. With this loan he plans to buy 15 head of cattle. He buys cattle in the villages surrounding Bougouni from cattle farmers, but he also goes to the main livestock markets in the region (Si\u00e9korol\u00e9, Ni\u00e9na, Koumantou, Massigui, Bougouni, etc.). His client base is comprised mostly of butchers from the market in Bougouni, but also families who are holding ceremonies (marriages, baptisms, funerals). He hopes to make a profit of 60,000 FCFA (about $142) per cycle which will be used to pay the interest on the loan, reinvested in his business, and used to take care of his family\u2019s expenses.  \r\n<b><p>Translated from French by Manuel Carreiro, Kiva Volunteer<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nMonsieur Amadou W. est \u00e2g\u00e9 de 41 ans et vit avec ses 2 enfants chez son p\u00e8re dans une grande famille \u00e9largie au quartier Massablacoura de la ville  de Bougouni.(Pr\u00e9fecture de Bougouni R\u00e9publique du Mali)\r\nUssie d\u2019une famille Diawanb\u00e9 (ethnie tr\u00e8s habile dans les n\u00e9goces en Afrique de l\u2019Ouest) il ne fr\u00e9quenta pas l\u2019\u00e9cole en raison des d\u00e9placements fr\u00e9quents de son p\u00e8re.

Having not gone to school and in order to weave himself into the economic fabric of society, Mr. Ousamne H. has managed several income-generating activities with no success. He decided to apprentice as a woodworker next to one of his cousins, who is very respected and well known in woodworking in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. With proven experience of 15 years, he now has an unmatched reputation in Bougouni as a woodworker. In order to obtain additional financial resources to satisfy the needs of his customers, which are becoming greater and more demanding, he decided to get involved with the Soro Yiriwaso loan program with which he is on his first individual loan. He plans to buy 20 planks of wood, two boxes of glue, 10 bags of nails, five sheets of plywood, and one electric plane. He often buys supplies in Bougouni, Bamako (capital of Mali), sometimes in Guinea, and in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire where wood is of a higher quality and at a good price. His workshop situated in the H\u00e9r\u00e9makono quarter receives many orders for furniture, office furnishings, etc. for government buildings and from masons who work for private individuals.

Arakiy\u00e9 Traor\u00e9 is 58 years old and lives with her husband and their five children in a monogamous family in the first quarter of S\u00e9gou (fourth largest economic region in Mali). Having not gone to school for social reasons, she got involved very quickly in income-generating activities, most notably the firewood business as well as that of dyed damask (a highly-valued cloth in West Africa), and has been doing so for 10 years. She has been working with the Soro Yiriwaso institution for four years. After having taken out six group loans with an association from her neighborhood, she is on her second individual loan and all previous loans have been correctly repaid. She travels to Bamako to stock up on damask from one of the best-known suppliers in the capital, if not the entire country of Mali, Gagni Lah. She also purchases firewood on site from farmers who are officially recognized in the firewood business. She sells her goods from her house, night and day (because she has access to a specially-designed area where her wood is stored, sheltered from the rain). With a client base that is mostly female, she sells her dyed cloth on credit which is repayable monthly (for those who are employed) or for cash. She plans to buy 27 loads of firewood and 10 rolls of white damask. Mrs. Traor\u00e9 hopes to earn a monthly profit of 40,000 FCFA (about $95) which will be reinvested into her cloth dying business and used for repaying the interest on the loan.\r\n<b><p>Translated from French by Manuel Carreiro, Kiva Volunteer<\/b><p>\r\nMadame   Arakiy\u00e9 Traor\u00e9 est \u00e2g\u00e9e de 58 ans et vit avec son mari et ses 5 enfants dans une famille monogame au premier quartier de S\u00e9gou (quatri\u00e8me r\u00e9gion \u00e9conomique du Mali).

So they decided as a group to request a collaboration with the the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso.  They generally get their supplies in Cinzana, Gare, S\u00e9gou, and locally in town.  Millet seeds are pounded, sifted, and steamed before being dried in the sun and protected from flies and contamination.  Next, the finished product is placed into a calebasse (a bowl made from a gourd) for selling.  Sales are generally made either with cash or credit, in the home or door-to-door, in S\u00e9gou and in Soro W\u00e8r\u00e8.  The customers are composed of all social categories:  men, women, and sometimes children.  \r\n<p> With this loan, they each intend to buy two sacks of grain, sixty calebasses, and a large quantity of condiments.

They are from the La Conquista settlement within the La Lomita neighborhood. <p>\r\n\r\nThese women, along with the other ladies who make up the group, comprise part of a faction of people denominated as \u201cwithout roofs\u201d.  These people have nowhere to live (neither a house or land) and, together with hundreds of other people in the same situation, joined together to fight for their rights.  Today, they live in a settlement which they created a year ago which the government subsequently bought to be able to build them homes so they could live there legally. <p>\r\n\r\nIn this settlement live several families looking to get ahead.  The women play an important role since, in many cases, they are the head of household.  It\u2019s in this way that 15 women from the settlement gathered together to form the group called La Esperanza (which means \u201chope\u201d).  They carry out a variety of activities:  the sale of garlic, medicinal herbs, food sales, some have stores, others sell blankets, sheets, clothing, toys, housewares, cleaning products, etc. <p>\r\n\r\nGiven that the settlement is in a remote area, they must travel to get to the nearest clinics.  It\u2019s for this reason that Marta decided to take courses in medicine and it is she who gives injections, takes blood pressure readings and provides immediate medical care for those who need it. <p>\r\n\r\nIt is a very unified group and the women, in addition to dedicating themselves to their particular activities, also carry out extra tasks to earn more funds to help improve the neighborhood. <p>\r\n\r\nToday they need a loan to invest in their businesses, especially to buy merchandise to offer for sale.   <p>\r\n\r\n<p><b> Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn, Kiva Volunteer. <\/b><p>\r\n\r\nEste Comit\u00e9 se formo gracias a la se\u00f1oras Lucia G. y Marta Dom\u00ednguez, quienes llamaron a la fundaci\u00f3n interesadas en el programa Comit\u00e9 de Mujeres Emprendedoras, ellas son del Asentamiento \u201cLa Conquista\u201d del  Barrio \u201cLa Lomita\u201d.<p>\r\n\r\nEstas se\u00f1oras, al igual que las dem\u00e1s mujeres que comprende este comit\u00e9, forman parte de un grupo de gente denominado \u201csin techo\u201d.

This group of women, who are linked by ties of community, age, and clan, does trading in agricultural products and other goods of small-scale commerce.  In order to meet the stronger and stronger demand, this group decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso loan program, which just allocated the members their first loan.  \r\n<p>They resupply their inventory locally in Zambougou and in surrounding villages (Teisserela et Ganssola) from pilot growers for agricultural products.  The supply of the various goods is gotten from S\u00e9gou from wholesalers of the grand marketplace.  These women each have storage space on the allotted family plots for keeping their inventory.  They each intend to use this loan to buy:  one sack of beans, a sack and a half of rice, 15 sacks of millet, and 250 liters of milk. \r\n<p>Sales are made at the retail level, cash and credit accepted, from home most of the time and at the public square and in the marketplaces of nearby villages.  The customers are generally made up of city inhabitants and of specialists in the stocking up and selling of agricultural products.

They have a six-year-old daughter. Silvia, who is a teacher, helps with the household expenses.<p>\r\nAmerico has a small dairy farm where he raises milk cows that produce an average of 50 liters of milk per day. He sells the milk in different places around the town.<p> \r\nThree years ago Americo used to make plant pots, but the sale of the pots became less and less profitable. At that time he already had a cow, so he started selling the milk until he was able to save enough to buy another cow. Slowly but surely his dairy business grew.<p>\r\n Americo also has a small plot of land where he grows grass and sugar cane, which in turn are used to feed the cows. Americo does not have to spend as much in commercial feed for the cows.<p>\r\nThrough Fundacion Paraguaya,  he previously received a loan, which he paid promptly after investing it in buying one more cow. This time is is requesting another loan to buy another cow and increase his dairy farm milk production, and well as his income.<p>\r\n<b> Translated from Spanish by Maria B., Kiva volunteer <\/b><\/p>\r\n\r\nAm\u00e9rico tiene 36 a\u00f1os, vive en pareja con Silvia de 33 a\u00f1os de edad.

Luego sale a vender dicha producci\u00f3n hacia distintos lugares de la ciudad.<p>\r\nComenta que anteriormente se dedicaba a la fabricaci\u00f3n y venta de planteras de cemento (macetas), pero que dicha actividad le iba generando cada vez menos ganancias. Como ya contaba con una vaca lechera, comenz\u00f3 vendiendo la leche que \u00e9sta le produc\u00eda, hasta que pudo juntar el importe necesario para la compra de otra vaca m\u00e1s. Y fue as\u00ed que su negocio fue creciendo. Desde ese entonces ya han transcurrido tres a\u00f1os.<p>\r\nSu pareja, que se dedica a la docencia, le ayuda con los gastos del hogar. Am\u00e9rico tiene una peque\u00f1a chacra en donde cultiva pastos y ca\u00f1a dulce que luego son utilizados para alimentar a sus vacas, es por eso que ahorra bastante debido a que no tiene necesidad de comprar gran cantidad de balanceados.<p>\r\nYa recurri\u00f3 anteriormente a la Fundaci\u00f3n Paraguaya para acceder a un pr\u00e9stamo el cual invirti\u00f3 en la compra de una vaca lechera m\u00e1s, abonando en forma excelente todas sus cuotas.

Half of the group work as weavers of huipiles (typical blouses) and rebosos (scarves), while the other half work as embroiderers.  They embroider the huipiles or beautiful colorful blouses.  They reinvest their profits in the purchase of threads to weave or embroider their fabrics.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe Elenas de la Cruz sell their products in the market of their town.  They also sell in neighboring towns.  The interesting thing is that from Santa Cruz to other potential markets like Jaibalito and Tzununa, one can only reach them by boat.

Este pueblo est\u00e1 dividido entre los pobladores ind\u00edgenas, los cuales viven sus vidas de una manera muy tradicionales y un grupo de expatriados que actualmente est\u00e1n invirtiendo mucho en la industria del turismo. \r\n\r\n<P>Las mujeres de Santa Cruz viv\u00edan en la pobreza absoluta y sin mucha esperanza de salir adelante, hasta que hace unos cuantos a\u00f1os la \u201cgringa Lil\u201d empez\u00f3 a juntar a mujeres para que solicitaran pr\u00e9stamos a las instituciones de microfinanzas. Gracias a este esfuerzo esta industria empez\u00f3 a crecer en este bello pueblo. As\u00ed fue como The Friendship Bridge empez\u00f3 operaciones en Santa Cruz. \r\n\r\n<P>Todas las mujeres trabajan en el \u00e1rea textil. La mitad del grupo trabaja como tejedoras de huipiles (blusas t\u00edpicas) y rebosos (pa\u00f1uelos), mientras que la otra mitad trabaja como bordadoras. Ellas bordan los huipiles o bellas blusas de colores. Ellas invierten su cr\u00e9dito en la compra de hilos para tejer o bordar sus tejidos. \r\n\r\n<P>Las Elenas de la Cruz venden sus productos en el mercado de su pueblo. Ellas, tambi\u00e9n venden sus productos en los pueblos aleda\u00f1os. Lo interesante es que de Santa Cruz a los otros mercados potenciales como Jaibalito y Tzununa solo se puede llegar por lancha. Las se\u00f1oras arman sus canastos con mercader\u00eda y proceden a cargar los canastos en sus cabezas hasta las lanchas las cuales la llevan hasta los mercados de los pueblos aleda\u00f1os. \r\n\r\n<P>Este grupo de se\u00f1oras quieren seguir invirtiendo en sus negocios porque ellas quieren que sus negocios puedan seguir creciendo para seguir ayudando a sus familias. Ellas sue\u00f1as con que sus hijos puedan seguir estudiando hasta terminar una carrera. Ustedes pueden lograr que ellas cumplan con sus sue\u00f1os,

The group buys and sells wax-printed cloth (a favorite of Malian women) and food products (oils, bananas, eggs). This is their first foray into microfinance, and are collaborating with Soro Yiriwaso. The women of the Sindiya group want to use their loan to buy ten units of wax-printed cloth, a 25-liter drum of oil, ten sacks of yams, one hundred bunches of bananas, a supply of chicken eggs, etc. They purchase food products exclusively in the villages surrounding Sikasso, while they buy cloth and oil from wholesalers in the city market. They then sell their goods retail and wholesale in Sikasso, selling door-to-door and often on credit. The merchandise is sold from carts or from their stall in the M\u00e9dine marketplace.

Their group was formed 6 years ago but new members have been added over time.\r\n\r\n<P>The group has now 10 members and their work varies from weaving traditional blouses called huipiles, embroidering blouses with beautiful designs, sewing skirts, baking and selling bread, and weaving and selling the traditional reboso, a square piece of woven material the women use to carry their children and many other items.\r\n\r\n<P>The Artesanas women say that in the country, there is enough space to have business going but there is no clean water and electricity. The living conditions are hard. The city of Nahuala has fewer opportunities, but better living conditions. Working in a trust bank gives them the support socially and in their businesses. Besides that, they benefit from the additional trainings Friendship Bridge offers them. \r\n\r\n<P>Where there was no reason to leave the house before, their weekly gathering is a way to relax and is something to look forward to. Dominga T. says this helps to deal with their often difficult lives. Since she started attending the group meetings, she has made friends. The laughing and chatting brings joy to all of their lives. \r\n\r\n<P>The women of Artesanas sell their goods in the local market of Nahuala. Some of them have customers coming to their houses to place orders for the traditional skirts. Making a traditional skirt can take up to a week of work. At this moment, selling skirts and other clothes is difficult due to the rainy season when there is little demand.\r\n\r\n<P>Maria T. claims that most women stopped hoping to fulfill their own dreams; however, thanks to microfinance, now they can dream of creating opportunities for the next generation. One of the ladies proudly states that before there was not enough money to buy pencils, schoolbooks and bus fares. Now that they are working with Friendship Bridge, the children can go to school and do very well."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3775,"image":{"id":186268,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","use":"Purchase thread to

found.  They work with great responsibility with their payments and internal activities.  Within the group, many of the women lack basic services in their homes.  For example, do\u00f1a Verni cannot rely on potable water that should be supplied by public water basins.  What's more, like many others, she cannot rely on gas services and must buy gas in tanks.  Lamentably, she lives in a zone where distributors of these tanks do not pass very frequently which is why she has to go to busy streets in the hopes that one of these trucks will pass by.  She longs to be able to rely on these services in her home.  The main activity of this group is the weaving of sweaters, scarves, and other pieces of clothing, in Alpaca wool that they later sell in the \"16 de julio\" market in the city of El Alto.  Currently, they want to be able to increase their production so that they can sell their products to handicraft shops.  It is for this that they need more capital for the acquisition of raw materials to make their sweaters.
