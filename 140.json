She is 59 years old, married and she had 5 children. Their ages now are 27, 30, 35, 38 and 40 respectively. Two of them still live with her. She also provides supports to three grandchildren that live with her as well. Helena dropped out of school when she was on the 8th grade due to financial difficulties. She lived in the city of Maputo until she was 28 years old and had to relocate to Massaca, a district of Boane, when her husband was transferred -- they still live at their own home in that location. Besides raising chickens, she has been also working at a daycare facility as a supervisor for the past 10 years. Her shift there is from 6:30am to 5:00pm. She gets a monthly salary of 5000,00mt which she cannot save anything from for she invests it entirely into her business. This will be her second loan from Hluvuku and the first from Kiva. With her first loan she purchased 200 chicks and this time she wants to purchase 400 and enough feed for them. This will cause an income increase that will enable her to fulfill clients' orders. She wants to pay it back in advance so she can request another loan that will be used to expand her business location. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Bertolt Cantalice, Kiva

The group members average 41 years of age and five children.  They live in traditional polygamous families in the Bamanan Kin district of Kirango, in the sub-prefecture of Markala (fourth administrative region of Mali). \r\n\r\nEach belonging to the same traditional mutual-aid association and doing the same income-generating work, namely buying and selling fish and grain, the women of the Sabougnouman group decided jointly to sign up with the institution two years ago.  After having correctly repaid their two preceding loans, the group is on its third solidarity loan (group loan). \r\n\r\nThey intend to use this new loan to buy:  50 baskets of fish, 5 slabs of ice, 12 sacks of millet, 4 sacks of rice, and 2 sacks of beans.  While they get their supplies of fish from fishermen on the River Niger at the entrance of the Markala Dam, the grain is gotten from wholesale vendors at the weekly marketplace of Diamarabougou on Sundays.  If a portion of the fish is sold fresh (to women customers), the rest is smoked at home over traditional hearths designed especially for this, in order to be sold retail to bulk merchants, sometimes at the daily marketplace of Kirango Markala, in S\u00e9gou and in Bamako (the capital of Mali).  The grain is sold at the Diamarabougou marketplace to customers composed of women and men and generally in cash at the retail level. \r\n\r\nThey each hope to realize an average profit of 32,000 francs CFA each month that will be used for covering the children's school fees and to help their husbands meet family expenses.  Their ambition is to buy a house in which to live, especially for the orphans.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1875,"image":{"id":213834,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","use":"To buy fresh fish and grain ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Segou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14 -6","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2008-11-01T07:00:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dji","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ami","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Oumou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dj\u00e8n\u00e8bou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bintou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-15T17:10:11Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":900000,"loan_amount":1875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":128571.43},{"due_date":"2009-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":128571.43},{"due_date":"2009-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":128571.43},{"due_date":"2009-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":128571.43},{"due_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":128571.43},{"due_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":128571.43},{"due_date":"2009-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":128571.42}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":267.86},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":267.86},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":267.86},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":267.86},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":267.86},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":267.86},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":267.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":267.86,"local_amount":128571.43,"processed_date":"2008-12-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:29:23Z","rounded_local_amount":129521.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9974037,"comment":null},{"amount":267.86,"local_amount":128571.43,"processed_date":"2009-01-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:28:17Z","rounded_local_amount":129521.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14889410,"comment":null},{"amount":267.86,"local_amount":128571.43,"processed_date":"2009-02-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:13:13Z","rounded_local_amount":129521.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20440203,"comment":null},{"amount":267.86,"local_amount":128571.43,"processed_date":"2009-03-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:09:22Z","rounded_local_amount":129521.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135571,"comment":null},{"amount":267.85,"local_amount":128571.43,"processed_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:31:01Z","rounded_local_amount":129521.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033372,"comment":null},{"amount":267.86,"local_amount":128571.43,"processed_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:40:46Z","rounded_local_amount":129521.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44620778,"comment":null},{"amount":267.85,"local_amount":128571.42,"processed_date":"2009-06-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:23:26Z","rounded_local_amount":129521.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53019791,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-11-01T16:10:11Z","paid_date":"2009-07-16T00:23:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":69650,"name":"Hak","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Hak C. is a silk weaver in Kor Village in Kandal Province.

Brought together mainly through professional and neighborhood connections, the group sells cloth, fish, condiments, firewood, sugar, etc. All previous loans were repaid successfully.\r\nThe women will use this loan to purchase 30 meters of cloth, 3 boxes of smoked fish, 5 bags of sugar, 5 bundles of firewood and a large quantity of vegetables for condiments (e.g. eggplant, okra and onions). They obtain their supplies mainly from the West African towns of Sikasso in Mali, Bobo Dioulasso in Burkina Faso and Bouak\u00e9 in Ivory Coast. Sales are conducted door-to-door at various businesses or around the town\u2019s neighborhoods, or at their homes to neighbors who come to buy supplies day and night.\r\nTheir customers are mainly women but some men.

The remainder will be invested in their business. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Sarah Llewellyn, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1250,"image":{"id":213840,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy various items to sell (cloth, smoked fish, sugar, firewood and condiments).","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2008-10-15T16:30:23Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sanata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Safoura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sali","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadiatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Agass\u00e9","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ma\u00efmouna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-30T01:07:49Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":600000,"loan_amount":1250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":208.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":208.33,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-11-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T02:46:53Z","rounded_local_amount":100739.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5350974,"comment":null},{"amount":208.33,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-12-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:36:24Z","rounded_local_amount":100739.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9974038,"comment":null},{"amount":208.33,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-01-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:30:00Z","rounded_local_amount":100739.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14889411,"comment":null},{"amount":208.33,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:15:03Z","rounded_local_amount":100739.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20440204,"comment":null},{"amount":208.33,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-03-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:12:08Z","rounded_local_amount":100739.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135572,"comment":null},{"amount":208.35,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-04-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:34:48Z","rounded_local_amount":100739.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033373,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-10-16T01:07:49Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T23:34:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":69653,"name":"Sabiha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sabiha has been cooking and selling chapati and maandazi in Zanzibar since 2006.

They live in large extended traditional families in the Banconi neighborhood in Sikasso (third administrative region of the Republic of Mali). They met each others through neighboring ties and collaborations in the market where they all work. They typically buy and sell firewood, powdered drinks, condiments and fabrics. The group is seeking its sixth solidarity loan (group loan). All previous loans were repaid without problems. With this new loan, the women intend to buy 10 packs of powered drinks, 6 cartloads of firewood, 30 meters of fabric and a large quantity of condiments (eggplants, onions, okra, etc). They purchase goods from wholesalers in the market of Sikasso. Firewood gets purchased from farmers having an authorization to sell wood. The products are then resold at home and in the market of the M\u00e9dine quarter where each woman has an emplacement with a table to display their wares. Having a mostly female clientele, the members of the Yeredon group retail their goods for cash and on credit. They hope to turn a monthly profit of XOF 20'000 (ca US$ 40) on average, to be used to provide for their families, and to invest the remainder in their businesses.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Patrick Stadelmann, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":213856,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy powdered drinks, firewood, condiments, and fabrics","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2008-11-01T07:00:45Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Korotoumou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Minata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Soumba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"A\u00efchata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-17T07:44:49Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":175,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:30:26Z","rounded_local_amount":84620.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9974042,"comment":null},{"amount":175,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:28:30Z","rounded_local_amount":84620.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14889415,"comment":null},{"amount":175,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:13:43Z","rounded_local_amount":84620.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20440208,"comment":null},{"amount":175,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:09:43Z","rounded_local_amount":84620.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135576,"comment":null},{"amount":174.99,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:32:06Z","rounded_local_amount":84620.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033377,"comment":null},{"amount":175.01,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:41:13Z","rounded_local_amount":84620.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44620779,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-11-03T07:44:49Z","paid_date":"2009-06-16T02:41:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":69665,"name":"Sihaba","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sihaba has had a shop selling dresses, charcoal, and bananas in Zanzibar since 2004.

He is married with three children. He has chosen a certain direction in business - manufacturing. He thinks that there's no better business than manufacturing and if you can produce goods which have demand then your business can make good profits. Fahriddin is in the business of manufacturing wooden windows and doors. They are in demand and have buyers because Fahridding has a lot of clients. His products are made in Tajik style and also in European style. With the arrival of winter the construction gets intense and the demand for his products increases. Not very long ago Fahriddin has received an order for production of 2,000 boxes for fruits and to fulfill this order he needs to buy raw materials (wood) and for this he needs a loan for 4,000 somoni (USD$1,200).<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Elena Fedorchuk, Kiva

He is 71 years old, married and he's never had any children. He lives with a few nephews and his wife. He's lived in the city of Matola ever since he was a child. For over 10 years Abubacar has worked in the retail business by running a commercial establishment from 7:00am until 6:00pm. He has one employee. He notes that beer is a good product because he can buy a case of it for 230,00mt and sell it for 300,00mt. His store generates 1500,00mt daily and he is able to save a certain amount from that at the end of every month. He lives in his own home. This will be his first loan from Hluvuku and he has never requested loans from any other financial institution. He intends to pay it off in advance so he can request a second loan that will be invested in making his place of business more attractive by offering a better selection of goods. <br

He is 31 years old, married and has 3 children -- they are 3, 4 and 6 years old respectively. He is not responsible for anybody else. Flavio went to school only up until the 5th grade because he became an orphan at an young age and could not continue his education because he had to move in with his grandparents. He has always lived in the agricultural region of Massaca where he owns a smallholding and, for the last 13 years, has worked as a farmer. He works a split shift from 6:00am - 10:00am and 4:00pm - 6:00pm and he has 4 employees. He learned this skill by working on others smallholdings around the same area. The smallholding's monthly production may reach approximately 48000,00mt in horticulture trade -- a part of which gets saved away. He lives in his own home. This will be Flavio's second loan request. He previously obtained a loan of 30000,00mt from Pro-Credito. Flavio became aware of Hluvuku through a friend who was already a member. In the future, he wishes to build a loan-sponsored commercial establishment to sell agricultural products. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Bertolt Cantalice, Kiva

He is 26 years old, married and has one child. Aside from his own family Mamazoir also lives with his parents, so his family is very large, but he is currently the sole provider. Mamazoir works a lot to provide for everyone. He owns and manages a copy and cell phone card shop, which has been a profitable business, especially due to the store's central location. Mamazoir would like to take out a loan in order to purchase toner and paper wholesale in advance, allowing him to keep his prices low despite the rising costs on paper. He is planning to pay back the loan in the next 10 months.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Anya Lyuksyutova, Kiva

He is 31 years old, single, and the father of four children.  His first son is 9 years old, the second 8, the third 4, and the youngest is a baby only 4 months old.  Only the oldest child goes to school.  <P>\r\n\r\nAntonio attended primary school in Morrumbene and then had to go to Maxixe to attend secondary school.  No longer depending on the help of his parents, he decided to open a business selling soft drinks and beer.  He left Morrumbene to spend his holiday at his uncle\u2019s house in Maputo.  During his holiday, he decided to stay there and do business with the capital that he had accumulated from selling drinks in Morrumbene.  He started by selling sodas on the Costa do Sol beach.  In 2000 he tried diversifying his business with the sale of bed linens, which he purchased in Swaziland and resold in Namaacha.  To facilitate running his business, he rented a house in Namaacha, a village on the border of Swaziland.  The business did well, and Antonio was able to buy a plot of land and build his own house on it.  <P>\r\n\r\nYears later this business was not profitable, as the government became very strict about collecting customs duties.  Thus, Antonio quit this business and began another selling various electrical materials in the streets of the same district.  The best selling items of this business, which Antonio has continued through today, are television antennas which he buys for 300 meticais (MTn) and resells for 450MTn.  He works from 7am to 3pm. He earns 4,000MTn monthly, and is able to save 1,000MTn.  In addition to providing for his family, he takes care of two sister-in-laws who live with him.  <P>\r\n\r\nThis is Antonio\u2019s second loan with Hluvuku [Kiva\u2019s Field Partner] and his first with Kiva.  He used his first loan of 7,000MTn to purchase electrical materials to resell.  He requests this second loan of 10,000MTn to use for the same purpose.  He is confident that he will repay this loan early and take out another loan to build a grocery shop and quit being a street vendor.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by April Newman, Kiva

T. is 42 years old.

Single and 35 years old, he is the father of five children, between the ages of 2 and 16 years old.  The oldest three attend primary school.  <P>\r\n\r\nNelson studied through seventh grade, until the loss of his father. Then he had to take his father\u2019s place in service in South Africa to support the family.  He worked for eight years and completed the contract.  Returning to his native land, with the capital he had collected he bought a car and opened a small shop in his mother\u2019s house, where he sold basic necessities.  Through this business, Nelson was able to build his own house.  Years later, he got married and left his mother\u2019s house, but continued to work at the shop.  Little by little, he built a shop in his own house.  In 2007 he was able to complete its construction but did not have funds to buy merchandise.  Through a conversation with his friends, he learned of the services of Hluvuku [Kiva\u2019s Field Partner].  So he requested a loan and was able to buy inventory.  His best products are sugar, which he buys for 20 meticais (MTn) per kilogram and resells for 25MTn; rice, buying for 500MTn and reselling for 600MTn per sack; soap, buying at 200MTn and reselling for 275MTn per box; and salt.  In this region, people mostly live off agricultural products.  Nelson works from 7am to 6pm and makes 7,000MTn monthly.  As there are not a lot of shops in the area, he saves 2,000MTn per month.  In addition to providing for his children, Nelson takes care of his mother and his siblings, sending them 1,000MTn each month.  <P>\r\n\r\nThis is Nelson\u2019s second loan with Hluvuku and his first with Kiva.  He used the first loan of 10,000MTn to buy products for his shop, and he requests this second loan of 25,000MTn for the same purpose.  He is confident that he will repay the loan early, and he plans to request more loans in the future to start a business of raising and selling oxen.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by

He went to school through third grade.  He is married and the father of five children, ages two to nine years old.  Only the eldest goes to school.  In pursuit of work, Arlindo left his family in Gaza and moved to Namaacha, a village on the border with Swaziland.  <P>\r\n\r\nArlindo had to interrupt his studies after finishing third grade because of the meager financial situation of his parents, who were poor country folk.  As such, he had to start working as a cook in people\u2019s houses.  Years later he was contracted by some customs employees who worked at the border in Namaacha, where he moved to take the job.  He received 1,850 meticais (MTn) per month while working as a cook.  Years later his employers were transferred, and he found employment at a five-star hotel in the village (Hotel Libombos), where he has worked until now.  He works 7am to 3pm on the morning shift and 3pm to 10pm on the afternoon shift, earning a monthly salary of 1,800MTn.  But because this salary was not enough to cover all his necessities, he decided to open his own business.  He acquired a stall at the central market in the village, where he sells clothes he purchases in Swaziland.  His best-selling items are nightgowns, shorts, and shirts, which he buys for 55MTn, 120MTn, and 220MTn and sells for 180MTn, 250MTn, and 450MTn respectively.  He makes a monthly profit of 4,000MTn.  He is able to save 1,500MTn, sends 3,500MTn to his family, and spends 800MTn. In addition to supporting his family, he takes care of three nephews, who live with his wife in Gaza because they lost their father.  <P>\r\n\r\nThis is Arlindo\u2019s second loan with Hluvuku [Kiva\u2019s Field Partner] and his first with Kiva.  He used his first loan of 9,200MTn to buy merchandise and requests this second loan of 15,000MTn for the same end.  He is confident that he will repay before the due date and will ask for another loan to complete his work in Gaza.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by April Newman, Kiva

He is married and the father of two children: the first is a 5-year-old daughter who goes to school, and the second is a 1-year-old son.  Belmiro moved with his aunt to Namaacha, a village on the border of Swaziland, to avoid the frequent illnesses to which he had been subject in the Gaza area.  <P>\r\n\r\nBelmiro arrived in Namaacha and was unable to get a spot in school to continue his studies.  The next year, his aunt gave him money to enable him to start his own business.  He began by selling cakes he bought in Swaziland and reselling them next to a soft drink stand at the border.  His business benefited when customs agents decided to shut down the soft drink stand; consequently he started selling soft drinks in addition to cakes and started exchanging currency.  Through this, Belmiro was able to build his own house.  Years later he got together with his wife and left his aunt\u2019s house.  <P>\r\n\r\nLittle by little he built his own shop in his house to augment the family\u2019s income.  His biggest products are wheat flour, which he buys at 20 meticais (MTn) and resells for 28MTn per kilogram; rice, buying at 500MTn and reselling for 625MTn per sack; fish, buying at 350MTn and reselling for 700MTn per plate; and pasta, buying at 200MTn and reselling for 350MTn per box.  He works from 7am to 8pm and earns 6,000MTn monthly.  He is able to save 2,000MTn per month.  In addition to his children, Belmiro takes care of his parents in Gaza, sending them 1,000MTn for basic goods each month.  <P>\r\n\r\nThis is Belmiro\u2019s second loan with Hluvuku [Kiva\u2019s Field Partner] and his first with Kiva.  He used the first loan, of 15,000MTn, to strengthen his cakes and drinks business and repaid the loan on time.  He is asking for this second loan, of 12,000MTn, to buy merchandise for his shop.  His goal is to grow his shop and request a new loan to purchase a vehicle to facilitate his day-to-day business.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by April Newman, Kiva

She began her business because she she has always liked sales and making crafts, and she decided to take advantage of these two abilities.  In January of 2000 she began selling used clothing in a traveling market, because her mother-in-law did the same, and had experienced success in doing so.  This same mother-in-law sent Maria clothing at a good price from the border cities of Reynosa and Matamoros.  Maria also makes crafts, and has been doing so since she was a little girl.  Her grandmother taught her how to make paper flowers and crowns for the Day of the Dead and later Maria went on to learn to make other types of adornments, mostly Christmas ornaments, which she learned from magazines.  She made all types of adornments depending on the season, for holidays such as Christmas, Day of the Dead, Mother's day, etc.  The previous loan that she received through KIVA helped her to purchase clothing and materials to make crafts, and to have good sales during the 2007 Christmas season.\r\nMaria needs a $325 loan which she will repay in 5 months to purchase more clothing and materials to make Christmas ornaments, so that she can offer a wider variety of products to her clients.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jordan Shanker, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":213978,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"Purchase materials to make Christmas ornaments to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Tampico, Tamaulipas","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"22.216667 -97.85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":16,"posted_date":"2008-10-18T19:30:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Candelaria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-01T20:57:31Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":4000,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2009-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":65,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-17T09:07:26Z","rounded_local_amount":807.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9891789,"comment":null},{"amount":65,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-21T08:55:55Z","rounded_local_amount":807.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14815018,"comment":null},{"amount":65,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:15:45Z","rounded_local_amount":807.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20349823,"comment":null},{"amount":65,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2009-03-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T08:58:33Z","rounded_local_amount":807.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27037109,"comment":null},{"amount":65,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T09:35:15Z","rounded_local_amount":807.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35927535,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-10-18T20:57:31Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T09:35:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":69724,"name":"Katiuska","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Katiuska, de 25 a\u00f1os de edad, tiene 2 hijas preciosas, que son su raz\u00f3n de seguir adelante, es madre soltera, se dedica a la venta de jugos al paso, en su propio domicilio y le va muy bien, trabaja para sus hijas, a quienes en un futuro quiere ver profesionales y mujeres \u00fatiles a la sociedad.

Mar\u00eda began her business because she needed additional income, because the household expenses and her children's expenses were increasing.  Also, she enjoys sales, and has met many people who have helped her sell her products.  She began 16 years ago with a small grocery store, but later had to work as a maid, and did not have time to devote to her store.  Later, in March of 2003, a neighbor invited her to sell through a catalogue.  At first, her earnings were not very high, but with time they have risen.  The previous loan that Maria received through Kiva helped her to come out ahead, as it permitted her to purchase additional merchandise and improver her business.  \r\nNow she needs a $325 loan which she will repay in 5 months. She will use the loan to fill her orders and purchase additional cosmetic products for this end-of-year season, so that she can meet her clients' needs.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jordan Shanker, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":213994,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchase cosmetic products to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Tampico, Tamaulipas","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"22.216667 -97.85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":16,"posted_date":"2008-10-18T20:10:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-01T21:36:43Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":4000,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2009-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":65,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-17T09:07:26Z","rounded_local_amount":807.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9891791,"comment":null},{"amount":65,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-21T08:55:56Z","rounded_local_amount":807.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14815020,"comment":null},{"amount":65,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:15:44Z","rounded_local_amount":807.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20349825,"comment":null},{"amount":65,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2009-03-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T08:58:31Z","rounded_local_amount":807.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27037111,"comment":null},{"amount":65,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T09:35:16Z","rounded_local_amount":807.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35927537,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-10-18T21:36:43Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T09:35:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":69737,"name":"Zenaida","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Zenaida tiene 20 a\u00f1os, es soltera y vive en casa de su madre.

Wilma is the group representative and she was chosen among her peers to be the group leader. She is a very faithful and humble person, and the type of person who will make a great leader. She is the mother of three children, and wants something better for their future. She plans on starting a small business selling food in her area. She hopes to continue receiving loans and to someday have her own restaurant. She also hopes to open a small store as well. She is very ambitious and realizes this is her chance to change her life!

Maria learned to sew as a young girl but, because her family was humble and poor, she did not have a sewing machine.  Through her solidarity group with ADIM, she was able to get a loan to buy a machine, and she repaid the loan very responsibly.   Maria feels her greatest achievement as a woman is having started her own business.  She considers it to be one of the most important things that has happened because she has a large clientele for her business which is located in the market of Masaya.

Itupun hasilnya tidak seberapa besar dibandingkan dengan kebutuhan yang harus ditanggung setiap hari di keluarganya. Termasuk juga menanggung kedua anaknya yang masih sekolah di SMA dan SD. Dengan modal awal Rp.1000.000,- Gusti Ayu membuka warung di rumahnya yang menjual beberapa kebutuhan pokok serta makanan dan minuman. Gusti Ayu berharap bisa mendapatkan penghasilan tambahan dari usaha yang sudah ditekuninya hampir 2 tahun itu. Tetapi karena keterbatasan modal membuat usaha warungnya tidak berkembang dengan baik. Setelah mendapatkan penjelasan dari Staf DINARI tentang program yang mengembangkan usaha untuk masyarakat kecil, akhirnya Gusti Ayu memutuskan untuk meminjam modal ke DINARI melalui program Tempek. Pinjaman ini merupakan yang pertama bagi Gusti Ayu dan jangka waktunya adalah selama 12 bulan. Pembayaran dilakukan dengan cara mencicil setiap bulannya. Dengan modal yang dipunyai sekarang Gusti Ayu mampu menambah omset barang dagangannya menjadi lebih lengkap. Para pelanggannya yang berasal dari sekitar rumah Gusti Ayu pun semakin ramai karena barang-barang kebutuhan yang dijual sudah tersedia lengkap dan tidak perlu harus mencari jauh ke tempat lainnya. Hasil yang didapat dari usaha warungnya ini lumayan besar, setelah dipotong pembayaran ke DINARI setiap bulannya Gusti Ayu bisa meraup keuntungan mencapai Rp.200.000,-. Tentunya hasil ini sangat membantu perekonomian keluarga Gusti Ayu serta mampu memenuhi biaya sekolah kedua anaknya.","en":"As villagers who live in a village on a downhill, Gusti Ayu Ketut Ranten and her husband count on their garden products to fulfill their daily need but the income earned from gardening has never been enough, including to fund their 2 children in studying in elementary and high school level.\r\n\r\nWith Rp 1,000,000 as initial capital, Gusti Ayu started to open a small grocery store in their house. Gusti Ayu hopes that she will be able to earn additional income from her business that has been running for about 2 years.

After attending a short presentation on small enterprise development from DINARI, Gusti Ayu decided to propose loan from them through Tempek Program. The loan will be the first for her, that will be paid 12 months with monthly installment. With this additional capital, Gusti Ayu will be able to add the number and the varieties of goods she sell that she is sure her customer will be increase because they do not have to look for goods that they need to other store.\r\n\r\nThe income from her grocery store is quite good.

Sebab tinggal di pedesaan jadi ia harus memaksimalkan apapun yang dihasilkan dari kebun yang ada di pedesaan. Termasuk dengan memanfaatkan daun kelapa yang dipakai untuk bahan membuat tempat banten yang biasa digunakan pada setiap upacara keagamaan di Bali. Disamping membuat sendiri di rumahnya, Ketut juga membeli hasil pekerjaan dari orang lain yang kemudian akan dijualnya di pasar tradisional. Karena keterbatasan modal Ketut tidak bisa mengambil barang jualan berupa tempat banten ini dalam jumlah besar padahal disekitarnya banyak sekali yang membuatnya dan perlu dipasarkan. Akhirnya Ketut memberanikan diri untuk meminjam ke DINARI lewat program Tempek dengan jangka waktu 12 bulan serta pembayaran dilakukan mencicil setiap bulannya sehingga modal usahanya jual beli tempat banten ini bertambah dan bisa menampung lebih banyak untuk dipasarkan. Untuk satu ikat tempat banten dengan isi 50 biji biasanya dibeli oleh Ketut seharga Rp.7000,- dan kemudian dijualnya seharga Rp.10.000,- di pasar. Harga ini tergantung dari banyaknya hari raya dan upacara keagamaan. Kalau memang sedang musim yang baik untuk upacara keagamaan, harganya akan naik. Hasil yang diperoleh Ketut dari usahanya ini sangatlah lumayan, mampu mencukupi kebutuhan keluarganya serta membantu suaminya yang sebagai peladang dan menanggung satu orang anaknya yang masih belum bekerja tetap.","en":"Ni Ketut Lantri has started to produce \"banten\" plate, a plate to put Balinese ceremonial offering knitted from coconut leave, since she was still single. She produces them by making use of those from gardens in her village. She also purchase finished \"banten\" plate from her neighbors and sell them in the traditional market nearby. For 50 pieces, she should pay Rp 7,000, and will sell them for Rp 10,000. The price is varied, according to the frequency of the ceremonials. The more frequent, the more expensive the price will be.\r\n\r\n\"Banten\" plate production number in Ketut Lantri village is quite big, but she cannot trade more because of the limited capital she has. Thereby she proposes a 12 months loan form DINARI through Tempek Program to boost her business. She will pay the installment monthly.\r\n\r\nKetut Lantri earns quite good income from the business. She uses it to fulfill their family daily needs to help her husband who is a farmer, and to support their only child who has not had a permanent job.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Indonesian by

Dengan mulai berjualan dari jam 07.00 pagi hingga jam 09.00 malam dengan menjual berbagai kebutuhan pokok serta makanan dan minuman. Modal awal yang dipakai Komang untuk memulai usahanya ini sekitar Rp.1000.000,- dan memang dirasakan sangat kurang karena barang-barang dagangan yang dijual hanya berkisar itu-itu saja. Untuk meningkatkan hasil dari usahanya ini sehingga paling tidak mampu membantu suami yang hanya sebagai petani akhirnya Komang bertekad untuk menambah modal usahanya dengan meminjam ke DINARI melalui program Tempek. Pinjaman dengan jangka waktu 12 bulan dan pembayaran cicilan setiap bulan ini akan dipakai untuk menambah omset barang dagangan yang akan dikembangkannya kearah penjualan barang-barang pokok kebutuhan dapur. Para pelanggan pun bertambah karena semakin lengkapnya barang dagangan di warung Komang Suarmi. Keuntungan bersih yang diperoleh setiap bulannya hampir Rp.300.000,- dan hal ini sangat membantu Komang dan suaminya dalam memenuhi kebutuhan sehari-hari serta menyekolahkan anaknya di bangku SD disamping juga memenuhi kebutuhan anak keduanya yang masih bayi. Kerjasama dengan DINARI meskipun baru pertama kali tetapi dirasakan sangat membantu meningkatkan taraf kehidupan dari Komang Suarmi.","en":"It has almost been 10 years since Komang Suarmi running her small grocery store in her house. She sells various goods, food and beverages, and opens the store at 7.00 am until 9.00 pm. The initial capital outlaid for the business was Rp 1,000,000. Komang Suarmi realizes that there should be more amounts deployed, so that goods sold can be more in number and varieties, but it was all they had.\r\n\r\nTo improve her grocery store that will help her husband who is only a farmer in fulfilling their daily needs, Komang propose to earn loan from DINARI through Tempek Program. Komang will use the 12 months loan with monthly installment to increase the number and the variety of goods sold, especially the variety of seasonings and kitchen materials. Komang is sure that the more variety her grocery store provides, the more customer will shop, and the more she will earn.\r\n\r\nKomang is able to earn Rp 300,000 a month from the store. The income is really usefull, especially to help her husband to fulfill their family daily needs and to fund their child\u2019s tuition fee, as well as to raise their toddler. The first cooperation with DINARI will be very helpful to Komang Suarmi and her family.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Indonesian by Hestyana Dyah Kuntari, Kiva

Luh Putu Supartini","description":{"languages":["id","en"],"texts":{"id":"Meskipun tergolong ibu yang masih muda tetapi Putu Supartini sangat tekun menggeluti usaha membuat tempat banten atau di Bali biasa disebut Mejejaitan untuk upacara keagamaan. Usaha yang ditekuni sejak masih remaja ini awalnya hanya untuk dipasarkan disekitarnya saja tetapi lama-kelamaan karena banyak yang memerlukan bantuan untuk dipasarkan lebih luas akhirnya dengan modal hanya Rp.500.000,- awalnya, Putu menampung hasil karya dari para tetangganya dan kemudian dijualnya di pasar tradisional kota. Per ikatnya Putu biasanya membeli seharga Rp.7000,- dan kemudian dijualnya di pasar seharga Rp.10.000,- sampai Rp.15.000,- tergantung situasi banyaknya upacara yang terselenggara. Dengan pinjaman modal dari DINARI melalui program Tempek, Putu mampu meningkatkan omset jual beli tempat bantennya dengan cara mengambil hasil karya sampai keluar dari desanya dan memang sudah menjadi langganan tetap dari Putu. Pinjaman ini berjangka waktu selama 12 bulan dengan pengembalian dicicil setiap bulannya. Dengan bertambahnya modal tentunya hasil penjualannya juga bertambah dan keuntungan yang didapatpun lumayan besar sehingga dapat membantu suaminya yang hanya mengandalkan hasil dari kebun yang diolahnya. Keuntungan ini sedikit demi sedikit ditabung untuk keperluan anaknya nanti karena memang sekarang Putu masih belum dikaruniai seorang anak. Program DINARI ini sangat penting pengaruhnya terhadap taraf ekonomi keluarga Putu Supartini untuk mencukupi biaya kebutuhan sehari-hari yang dirasakan semakin tinggi saja.","en":"Even though Putu Supartini is still young, she is very keen in running her small business: \u201cMejejaitan\u201d production. \u201cMejejaitan\u201d is a plate to put Balinese ceremonial offering (\u201cBanten\u201d), knitted from coconut leaves. Putu Supartini has started her business since she was very young. She started to produce \u201cMejejaitan\u201d by her own, and market her product to her neighbor, but then because of the increasing demand, she started to need helpers. With Rp 500,000 at the beginning, she purchased finished \u201cMejejaitan\u201d from her neighbor, and then sell them in the nearby traditional market. Putu pays Rp 7,000 for a bunch of \u201cMejejaitan\u201d, and sell it for Rp 10,000 up to Rp 15,000, according to the ceremonial session. With loan from DINARI through Tempek Program, Putu was able to increase her revenue. The loan is a 12 months loan with monthly installment. With higher capital, Putu Supartini is able to earn more income that she is able to help her husband, a farmer who only count on the result of their garden, to fulfill their family\u2019s daily needs.\r\n\r\nRight now Putu Supartini and her husband have not had any children yet, but they are saving some of their income to be able to fund their children\u2019s tuition fee in the future. Loan from DINARI through Tempek Program is very important for Putu Supartini\u2019s economics to fulfill her family daily needs.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Indonesian by Hestyana Dyah

Con el dinero que Luz requiere, expandir\u00e1 su negocio, comprando m\u00e1s mercader\u00eda, para que en el futuro su tienda llegue a tener m\u00e1s sucursales.","en":"Luz is 40 years of age. She lives with her husband Edwin and her three children, Daniel who is 16, Karelyn who is 14, and Huber who is 4.  For ten years, Luz has worked in her shop where she offers beauty products, stationery, photocopies, etc.  She works all morning and from 3 to 6 in the afternoon, when there is a demand for her products.  Luz is a lawyer by profession, but given her realities, she was not able to practice and decided to work in business. She really enjoys this work.  Since she has been making good earnings from her little store, it allows her to support her children and to provide them with a good education.  The unfortunate thing is having to provide all of the services which, at times, makes her very tired.  Luz works with the future of her children in mind who she wants to see succeed.  With the money that Luz needs, she will expand her shop, buying more merchandise so that in the future her shop will come to have more branches. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Joanna Silverman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":214624,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"Increase the merchandise for her shop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-10-24T02:10:22Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-07T13:23:49Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3700,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":616.67},{"due_date":"2009-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":616.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":616.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":616.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":616.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":616.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":200,"local_amount":616.67,"processed_date":"2008-12-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T01:16:53Z","rounded_local_amount":620.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9957427,"comment":null},{"amount":200,"local_amount":616.67,"processed_date":"2009-01-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:03:42Z","rounded_local_amount":620.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10227677,"comment":null},{"amount":200,"local_amount":616.67,"processed_date":"2009-02-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:03:22Z","rounded_local_amount":620.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20422912,"comment":null},{"amount":200,"local_amount":616.67,"processed_date":"2009-03-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:33:53Z","rounded_local_amount":620.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116136,"comment":null},{"amount":200,"local_amount":616.67,"processed_date":"2009-04-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:43:43Z","rounded_local_amount":620.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011096,"comment":null},{"amount":200,"local_amount":616.65,"processed_date":"2009-05-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:54:52Z","rounded_local_amount":620.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44594703,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-10-24T12:23:49Z","paid_date":"2009-06-16T00:54:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":69969,"name":"Massanvi","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Ag\u00e9e de 70 ans, Madame T.

She has a 6-year-old son who is attending the second grade of primary school.  Her domestic partner works in the office of transportation.  Her goal is to be able to maintain her business and thereby be able to continue providing her own income and not be dependent upon her domestic partner.  She very much wants to be able to convert her small store into a local eatery.  Here she would make her clients feel as much at home as at a business.  Her dream is to be able to have her own home given that she now lives with her mother.  She wants to keep her family together, to be able to help her elderly mother as much as possible, and to keep growing her clientele.  Her business actually consists of sales of soup, fast foods, beer and soft drinks.  She has dedicated herself to her business for seven years.  She started in the business as a way to generate her own income, and like all women with a fighting spirit, put her business ideas into practice.

In the future, she would like to own a shop in her home, have a bigger home, and support her children with their education.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jenson Abraham, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":214664,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"To make repairs to her house","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2008-10-19T13:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yaricza Ivania","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-02T15:19:49Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":8000,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2009-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2009-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2009-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2009-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2009-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2009-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2009-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2009-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":888.88}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.48}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":44.44,"local_amount":888.89,"processed_date":"2008-12-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T09:56:24Z","rounded_local_amount":892.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9893345,"comment":null},{"amount":44.44,"local_amount":888.89,"processed_date":"2009-01-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T09:15:18Z","rounded_local_amount":892.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14816422,"comment":null},{"amount":44.44,"local_amount":888.89,"processed_date":"2009-02-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:17:36Z","rounded_local_amount":892.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20351129,"comment":null},{"amount":44.44,"local_amount":888.89,"processed_date":"2009-03-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:02:33Z","rounded_local_amount":892.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27038447,"comment":null},{"amount":44.44,"local_amount":888.89,"processed_date":"2009-04-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T09:37:40Z","rounded_local_amount":892.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35928750,"comment":null},{"amount":44.44,"local_amount":888.89,"processed_date":"2009-05-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:18:31Z","rounded_local_amount":892.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44383677,"comment":null},{"amount":44.44,"local_amount":888.89,"processed_date":"2009-06-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T16:23:07Z","rounded_local_amount":892.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52890167,"comment":null},{"amount":44.44,"local_amount":888.89,"processed_date":"2009-07-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T09:31:37Z","rounded_local_amount":892.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63111494,"comment":null},{"amount":44.48,"local_amount":888.88,"processed_date":"2009-08-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T09:38:46Z","rounded_local_amount":892.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73532937,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-10-19T14:19:49Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T09:38:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":69992,"name":"Karla Banessa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Karla Banessa  U.

With the loan requested she will buy utensils, benches or chairs and pay better attention to her business.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Sofia Burt, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":214677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase utensils and furniture for business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-10-24T06:30:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mady","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-07T13:06:20Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":166.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2008-12-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T01:17:01Z","rounded_local_amount":168.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9957438,"comment":null},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-01-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:03:50Z","rounded_local_amount":168.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10227688,"comment":null},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-02-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:03:29Z","rounded_local_amount":168.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20422923,"comment":null},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-03-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:33:48Z","rounded_local_amount":168.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116147,"comment":null},{"amount":54.16,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-04-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:43:31Z","rounded_local_amount":168.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011107,"comment":null},{"amount":54.16,"local_amount":166.65,"processed_date":"2009-05-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:54:43Z","rounded_local_amount":168.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44594711,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-10-24T12:06:20Z","paid_date":"2009-06-16T00:54:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":69997,"name":"Neo Club Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Cr\u00e9\u00e9 en 2004, l\u2019association NEO-CLUB est un groupe de sonorisation tr\u00e8s sollicit\u00e9 dans le canton d\u2019Aklakou et de ses environs lors des manifestations aussi bien heureuses (anniversaires, bapt\u00eames, sortie de nouveau n\u00e9, f\u00eates\u2026.) que malheureuses (d\u00e9c\u00e8s). \r\n\r\nCependant l\u2019association ne dispose pas de v\u00e9hicule pour assurer le transport des mat\u00e9riels de sonorisation.

Mrs. Lach Y. is the village bank president; she has been selected by the members. She has 2-hectar where she can cultivate rice. Her husband, Mr. Ke Khon, is a fisherman. In order to improve this business, his wife decided to ask for a loan to buy more fishnets; she will use the rest of the loan to purchase a new boat to replace the old one. She hopes that she can increase her income and improve her living conditions with this new loan. Mrs. Lach Y. is 55 years old and the mother of three children, one of whom immigrated to Thailand to work and another of whom is a farmer. The youngest one is still attending the local school. Mrs. Hor I. does not come to take a loan but her husband is, so he is presented in the picture instead.\r\n\r\nThis is a village bank loan consisting mainly of end-of-term loans. Thirteen members have end-of-term loans and the rest have monthly payment loans. These members are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK's main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia's poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to do so. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK's clients make their payments on time. AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09% and AMK has a default rate of 0% on Kiva."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":214886,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","use":"Purchasing new fishnets and a new boat","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":109,"posted_date":"2008-10-25T04:50:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lach","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Phouk","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Oung","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Uch","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bai","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Keb","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yeab","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sak","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Phorn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Koy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Khoeun","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Khon","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pai","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Doem","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hor","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-08T19:50:55Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":4100000,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":410000},{"due_date":"2009-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":410000},{"due_date":"2009-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":410000},{"due_date":"2009-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":410000},{"due_date":"2009-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":410000},{"due_date":"2009-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":410000},{"due_date":"2009-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":410000},{"due_date":"2009-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":410000},{"due_date":"2009-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":410000},{"due_date":"2009-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":410000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":49.1,"local_amount":201300,"processed_date":"2008-11-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-15T20:17:31Z","rounded_local_amount":205912.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5286348,"comment":null},{"amount":24.07,"local_amount":98700,"processed_date":"2008-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T12:15:44Z","rounded_local_amount":100961.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9899290,"comment":null},{"amount":24.39,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T09:49:17Z","rounded_local_amount":102291.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14823441,"comment":null},{"amount":24.39,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:47:16Z","rounded_local_amount":102291.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20359874,"comment":null},{"amount":24.39,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:50:20Z","rounded_local_amount":102291.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27048923,"comment":null},{"amount":36.8,"local_amount":150900,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T10:48:10Z","rounded_local_amount":154357.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35940597,"comment":null},{"amount":58.93,"local_amount":241600,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-19T07:37:50Z","rounded_local_amount":247136.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44398180,"comment":null},{"amount":757.93,"local_amount":3107500,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-17T07:42:53Z","rounded_local_amount":3178707.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52906004,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-10-25T18:50:55Z","paid_date":"2009-07-17T07:42:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":70078,"name":"Maksuda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"U.

She makes very little in revenue because what she grow is primarily just to feed her household, and she does not have much of her crop left for sale. Her husband, Phai Kang, is a construction foreman. The people in her community normally contact him directly whenever they need him to construct their houses or other buildings. In order to complete his construction projects on time, Kang has to hire three or four other construction workers to help him, and he has to pay them every week. Recently this couple has faced a financial problem and they do not have enough money to pay their workers. (In reality, he could receive his wage fee from the building owner whenever his building is completed).
