Lilibeth, 46, realizes this truth and makes sure she and her family live their lives at the maximum. She finished only the first year in high school. At present, she works hard in business to make up for what she lacks in education. Her husband Policarpio, a vendor, works hard too. They have two children, one of whom is already working, while the younger one studies in college.  Together, they live in Parola Area, Binondo, Manila.\r\n\r\nLilibeth manages her own sari-sari (variety) store. Here, she sells daily household essentials and sells rice in retail. Lilibeth also raises hogs for a living.  These businesses are all managed and operated near their home. Lilibeth has worked these businesses for 12 years now. With the help of one delivery boy, she makes around Php1, 000 net income daily.\r\n\r\nTo help her improve her business, Lilibeth applies for a Php26, 000 loan. She will use this money to purchase additional grocery items for her store.  She will also purchase at least four hogs for slaughter and sell. Lilibeth says that this loan will definitely increase her capacity to earn. With the incoming profits, she plans to allocate funds to what is needed in her business: materials needed for hog raising, replenishment of stocks in her store, and more. She also plans to avail herself of government services for health and insurance to keep her and her family in good shape.\r\n\r\nLike many micro-entrepreneurs, Lilibeth also has her share of periods of low sales, especially during summertime when people go out of town or prefer to stay home all day. But still she refuses to settle for anything less than a life lived to the fullest. She desires to achieve success in business and see that her children will also become successful. Lilibeth hopes to have a vacation in their home province in Cebu.  As a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":772368,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

one of the persevering community partners in CCT*, Enarcita, 49, works hard to make her business flourish. She was not able to reach high school; nevertheless, she makes sure that sad fact will not get in the way of a great future for her and her family. Enarcita is married to Francisco, a tricycle driver. Together they persevere to augment their family needs and reach their dreams. They have two children, one who works already, and one who studies in college. Their family used to live in Negros Oriental; at present, they reside in Tondo, Manila.\r\n\r\nEnarcita manages her own sari-sari (variety) store. Here, she sells daily household essentials like cooking oil,  toiletries, and beverages in retail prices. She also sells rice in retail, which works well since rice is the staple food of Filipinos. Her store being located adjacent to their home, Enarcita is able to invest her complete day time in this business and gets to earn Php1, 700 net income daily. She manages her store without the aid of any employees.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a Php50,000 loan. Enarcita intends to use this loan to restock grocery items in her store, such as soft drinks, milk in boxes, instant noodles, and toiletries, among others. She also plans to purchase sacks of rice for her rice retail business. Aside from supporting her business capital, this will also lead the way to increase savings to pay for franchise of her newly bought van.\r\n\r\nOne struggle Enarcita has at present is the low rate of sales. But she continuously devises strategies to get the community to patronize her store, because her dream of seeing her business grow fuels her perseverance to work hard. It is her desire to purchase their own lot and build their own home.  As a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":772380,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to pay

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions. But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, and mainly in Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History: Since December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

is a 61-year-old cattleman who is married with six children. Babamurod has been in this business for 4 years. He purchases the cattle in the local market and then he breeds and sells them. The cattle are kept in the cattle-shed and it takes a lot of effort to care for them. He sells his cattle in the market of Yavan, Sultonobod and in the market of Rudaki region. Now, Babamulod would like to expand his business and purchase more cattle. For this purpose, he has applied for 5000 Somoni and with your help he hopes to reach his goal. \r\n \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She thanks everyone for their support and promises to pay the loan in time. \r\n \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after it gained its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Don Rogelio lleva 4 a\u00f1os con este negocio por eso comenta que pasa por vaR. desafios como transportar el producto en una camionetita y hacer el gasto diario de gasolina, tambien como la camioneta se usa diario y son distancias grandes las recorre se tiene que hacer el servico seguido de la camioneta y hacer vaR. cambios, otro desafio que encuantra es que los precios suben y el tiene que dar un puco mas caro, si esto pasa don Rogelio sale perdiendo ya que sus clientes le reclaman porque volvio a subir y a el no le conviene porque va perdiendo clientes y los gastos que el hace con su camioneta sigen siendo los mismos \u00f3 mas caro, Don Rogelio dice; \"el prestamo me va beneficiar por medio de los ingresos que vaya teniendo por medio de las ganancias de cada producto que se venda, de esta manera yo pueda mantener a mi familia\" mis metas son engrandecer el negocio hasta poner un local para evitar tantos viajes, como tambien saber elaborar el producto, ya que compro el producto echo, pero no se como prepararlo y que tantas cosas sirven para hacerlo, Don Rogelio tiene 3 hijos, el peque\u00f1o es un ni\u00f1o de tres a\u00f1os, los dos mas grandes estudian la escuela primaria y la secundaria, don Rogelio vive en union libre hace ya 14 a\u00f1os y de edad tiene 46 a\u00f1os, vive en casa propia y su esposa es ama de casa, Los demas compa\u00f1eros de don Rogelio son comerciantes tambien y sus negocios son los siguientes;\n1.-Elidia, tiene un tienda de abarrotes\n2.-Sonia, cria pollos y guajolotes y productos de belleza\n3.-Anastacio, vende frituras chcharrones de cuadro\n4.-Ma Agustina, vende ropa de segunda mano\n5.-Natalia, vende pollos y verdura\n6.-Georgina, tiene un taqueria\n7.-Lilia vende Jarceria.

There are 8 members in the group and they live close to each other. They have known each other for many years and they all trust each other. As a group, they say that they have called themselves by this name because all the names they came up with were already taken, and they liked their chosen name best. The 8 members all run businesses, as is the case with Se\u00f1or Rogelio who runs a business selling cleaning products: 'Suavitel' for laundry, along with 'Clarasol' and 'Fabuloso' for cleaning floors and other surfaces in the home.\r\nDon Rogelio has run this business for 4 years and he tells us that he has faced many challenges, such as transporting the products in his little van; having to pay daily for gas; also as he uses the van daily for travelling long distances he has to take the van for services and pay for maintenance. Another challenge comes from rising costs which means he would have to sell his products at a higher price. If this happens, Don Rogelio ends up operating at a loss as he does not pass on these price rises to his clients. If he keeps on increasing his prices then he will lose his clients, and the costs that he must pay for his van continue to be the same or higher. Don Rogelio says, 'the loan is going to improve the income I receive from the sale of each product, and so I will be able to provide for my family'. His goals are to increase the size of his business until he has his own shop, so that he will not have to make so many journeys, as well as learning how to make the product, as he currently buys the product ready made but does not know how to prepare it and many items are needed to make it. \r\n\r\nDon Rogelio is 46 years old and has three children. The youngest is three years old and his two older children are at primary and secondary school respectively. Don Rogelio has been with his partner for 14 years, they live in their own home and his partner is a housewife. The other members in Don Rogelios group are also businesspeople, and their businesses are as follows:   \r\n\r\n1.-Elidia, runs a general store\r\n2.-Sonia, raises chickens and turkeys and sells beauty products\r\n3.-Anastacio, sells fried snacks\r\n4.-Ma Agustina, sells second hand clothes\r\n5.-Natalia, sells chicken and vegetables\r\n6.-Georgina, sells tacos\r\n7.-Lilia sells domestic products.

The members say that their group's name is the same of that of their community.  San Miguel is a large community but it doesn't have many services and is a long way from the main road.  They are starting to pave the main streets of the community.  In the meantime, there is a lot of loose earth and the roads are cobbled.  There are seven members of this group who all live in the same community.  The locals are very well-mannered and very kind.  Most people make a living selling products, whilst others raise animals.\r\n\r\nThis group's representative is Gregoria who has been married for 15 years and has four children who go to school: two sons and two daughters.  Her husband is a construction worker.  Owing to the nature of her husband's work, he sometimes has to stay away from home for one or two weeks since he travels to other states if it is necessary for his work.\r\n\r\nGregoria lives in her own home and she tells us that she works as a cook.  She has a business making Mexican snacks and she sells quesadillas, 'pambazos' (white bread, dipped in red chili pepper sauce, stuffed with potatoes and chorizo) and 'tacos dorados' (fried tacos).  She also serves coffee, tea and atole (a traditional, corn-based hot drink).\r\n\r\nGregoria has been in her business for several years and tells us that one of her challenges is that the local authorities won't give her permission to work in the market during the week.  They only let her work there on weekends: Saturdays and Sundays.  She also tells us that she lacks the money she needs to invest and buy everything she needs to work in her business.\r\n\r\nGregoria doesn't want to get into debt and so she is planning to invest her money wisely so that it leaves her some profits.  In this way, she would like to be able to help at home, buying what the family needs and improving the children's quality of life.  Gregoria's dreams are to improve and stabilize her business since she loses sleep in order to set up her business and she has a long walk between her business and her home.  She doesn't want her children to have to leave school because of a lack of money.  She does everything for her children.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are:\r\n1.

From an early age his parents taught him to love the land and how to work it. As a young man he grew corn but it was very hard work and brought him little profit. Now Rey sells popsicles and ice cream, a job he\u2019s been doing for sixteen years. He started out by selling from his house, then in his community of Curungueo, and finally as all was going well, he started going to other communities such as Macho de Agua and R\u00edo De Guadalupe amongst others. He walks around to sell his wares, outside primary schools for example, and when school is out, he sells in the streets of the communities. \r\n\r\nNow Rey is seeking a loan from Kiva partner Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad to buy more stock and also to buy ice cream cones, glass containers for ice cream, and another cooler as the one he has is very old.\r\n\r\nRey\u2019s needs are many as he has a family to help get ahead in life. He wants to add more rooms to his home which is no longer big enough since several of his children still live at home. He says, \u201cI want to give them a better life and buy more beds so that they don\u2019t all sleep together. Before, my house had no floor but thankfully sales increased so I was able to take out loans and put in a concrete floor. For this reason I am still working with a finance company because it has helped me provide my children with a better quality of life.\u201d\r\n\r\nRey has been married for thirty years to Sra. Amalia. They have six children. The oldest is called Mariana; she is married and has two children. Then there are Armando and \u00c1ngeles, aged 24 and 22. They both help Rey with household expenses such as buying gas or firewood, and paying the electricity bills. When they are able, they help pay for the school expenses of Miriam (18) and Liliana (13). His daughter 20-year old Lourdes is a single mother and helps with the household chores.\r\n\r\nRey\u2019s dream is to help his daughters get good jobs so they don\u2019t have to cut short their dreams. His goal is to establish a permanent store in his house so that his wife Amalia and daughter Lourdes can help him sell the products. In the future he wants to buy a freezer for the ice cream and popsicles.\r\n\r\nThe three other members of his group are Mariana, Virginia, and Benito who are seeking loans to buy fruit and vegetables, and Mexican snacks such as corundas (type of tamal sold in Michoac\u00e1n).\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1375,"image":{"id":771735,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy ice cream and popsicles","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Zitacuaro, Estado de Michoac\u00e1n.","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-05-20T16:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Reynaldo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Virginia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benito","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":16000,"loan_amount":1375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.58},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.59},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.58},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.58},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.59},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.58},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.58},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.58},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.59},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":114.58},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":114.58},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":114.59}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":308.26,"local_amount":3587.02,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:12:29Z","rounded_local_amount":3611,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216512704,"comment":null},{"amount":264.66,"local_amount":3079.63,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-19T07:48:05Z","rounded_local_amount":3100.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":222223350,"comment":null},{"amount":184.26,"local_amount":2144.1,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-16T08:10:29Z","rounded_local_amount":2158.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227201627,"comment":null},{"amount":239.25,"local_amount":2783.97,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:12:28Z","rounded_local_amount":2802.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232807231,"comment":null},{"amount":378.57,"local_amount":4405.28,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:22:42Z","rounded_local_amount":4434.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238618394,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-06-01T21:04:01Z","paid_date":"2011-11-15T10:22:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":299667,"name":"Miguel Oswaldo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Miguel G. de 29 a\u00f1os de edad, habita en casa propia con su esposa y su peque\u00f1a hija.

She has various businesses and says that she really likes her work. She enjoys it because that is how she has been able to earn money to take care of her three small children since she got divorced. She works making sugar and chocolate donuts and selling them in her town. Her ex-husband is the one who first taught her how to make donuts and she has been doing it for 4 years. \r\n\r\nLeonarda also works selling hamburgers at night, from Monday to Saturday. Now she is requesting a loan in order to sell silver jewelry. She is planning to go to Taxco in Guerrero to stock up on jewelry, because that is where they sell silver at a very reasonable price. She would like to begin selling jewelry in order to increase her earnings. \r\n\r\nLeonarda says that since she was very young, her parents imbued her with a love of work and that is why she is so hard-working, as well as responsible with her children and her home. Also, she recently put together some money to buy two pieces of land which she then resold at a higher price. With the capital from the sale, she was able to buy another larger piece of land which she is about to sell. She will continue investing in property and eventually with her earnings she will build a house for herself and her children, because the place they currently live is a rental. \r\n\r\nHer goal for her hamburger business is to put a permanent restaurant in her home so her clients have a comfortable place to eat. With the jewelry sales, she would like to build her clientele and be able to sell her merchandise quickly in order to buy more. \r\n\r\nThe other 10 members are Erika, Maria de los \u00c1ngeles, Araceli, Maria del Pilar, Marisela, Adriana, Raquel, Lucia, Marisela, Teresa. They want the loan in order to invest in their businesses: a grocery store, selling cosmetics by catalog, a ladies' clothing store, a bakery, a car wash, and selling Mexican pastries and snacks.   \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2825,"image":{"id":771808,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Jewelry","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy silver jewelry to sell.

engorda de borregos, tiene 20 a\u00f1os dedicandose al negocio de los animales y lo mas dificil ha sido que los animales se enfermen, ya que eso representa mucho gasto para poder salvar la vida de un

dejar que los borregos se hagan grandes de edad. El prestamo va beneficiar mucho a la familia del se\u00f1or Alfredo porque ya vendiendo el borrego hay una ganancia y eso ayuda para que pueda llevar comida a su casa, Las metas que tiene en mente son no darse por vencido para que le vaya mejor e ir luchando para que sus hijos les toque una mejor vida y una mejor educaci\u00f3n, mejores oportunidades de trabajo y sentirse orgulloso de sus hijos, don Alfredo tiene 8 hijos, los hijos que dependen de el son solo 2, pero el quiere que sigan la escuela y no la dejen por falta de dinero, el se\u00f1or Alfredo va cumplir 18 a\u00f1os de casado, vive en casa propia y su esposa se dedica al hogar. \n\nLos demas integrantes del grupo son las siguentes personas:\n1.-Tomasa, ella se dedica a criar borregos\n2.-Maria Guadalupe, se dedica a criar borregos\n3.-Francisca, se dedica a criar borregos\n4.-Natalia, se dedica a criar borregos y puercos\n5.-Victoria, se dedica a criar borregos\n6.-Manuela, se dedica a criar borregos y pollos\n7.-Marcela, se dedica a criar pollos y guajolotes\n8.-Leticia, se dedica a cuidar puercos.","en":"The following group is called \"El Cerrito\" [The Little Hill], located in the community of San Miguel La Labor. Here in the community there are many needs and a great deal of poverty. The people need work, something to which they may apply themselves in order to earn some money. The men in general do not have work and only offer themselves as construction workers. The women get married very young. This group is near the offices of Vision Mundial [World Vision] and the women's children are sponsored by Vision Mundial. The group is made up of eight women and one man. \n\nSe\u00f1or Alfredo is the group's representative and tells us how things are going in his business. Don Alfredo earns a living raising livestock, he raises and fattens sheep. He has been in the business for twenty years and the most difficult aspect has been when the animals get sick as that represents quite a bit of expense to be able to save the life of a sheep. For now Don Alfredo tells us, he has not had to deal with those mishaps, and when he buys them he only hopes they will bear young and he waits until the lambs are grown to be able to sell them and does not let the sheep get very large. The loan will be of great benefit to Se\u00f1or Alfredo's family since there is a profit when selling the sheep and that helps him be able to bring home food to his family. \n\nThe goals he has in mind are not to give up so that things may get getter and to keep struggling so that his children may have a better life and a better education, better work opportunities and to feel proud of his children. Don Alfredo has eight children of whom only two depend on him, but he wants them to stay in school and not leave school on account of no money. Se\u00f1or Alfredo will soon celebrate his 18th wedding anniversary.

In 1994 she started a business selling merchandise, especially shoes that she\u2019d bring from Bucaramanga and when her husband started working for a firm they opened a store.  They bought display cases that they stocked with a variety of products displaying them well, a business that today she runs with a profit margin no less than 7% selling paper goods, school supplies, natural remedies, toys, accessories and home decorations.  Her customers are primarily her neighbors that she sells to for cash.  She also has a select group of customers that she sells to on credit.\r\n\r\nHer Kiva loan is the second loan she\u2019s gotten from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.

She is a happy, single, hard-working, young woman that is eager to succeed in life.  She lives in her own house and what she would like most is to earn a good living so that she can give her future family financial stability.  \r\n\r\nShe started learning business strategies at a young age since she worked for her parents at their sales stand.  With the education they gave her and some savings she decided to become independent and forge ahead alone in the business sector.  Today she has her own business.  She buys products from farmers in the jungle such as coffee, cocoa, achiote [the natural pigment annatto is derived from this shrub], corn and palillo [a condiment].  She also has the help of 2 workers who are responsible for packing and weighing each product, thus allowing her to drive her car around to the various communities in search of products.  When she has a good quantity stored she sells it to middlemen who pay her a large percentage for each kilogram of product.  Her business is very profitable because apart from what she sells the middlemen give her incentives every year.  The rainy season and the landslides on the roads are a challenge because they block the roads and make delivery of the products difficult.

He works with a wide variety of patients, such as people suffering from muscle-skeletal diseases like Parkinson\u2019s and muscular dystrophy, as well as people recovering from injuries sustained in severe accidents. He also helps people suffering from occupationally-induced pain and general wear and tear. In addition to using massage therapy to alleviate patients\u2019 pain, David gets to the root of the problem by teaching them therapeutic exercises that help cure the underlying issues causing the pain. For example, he helps patients correct their gait and posture to avoid further joint or ligament damage, and works with them on increasing muscle strength around areas of injury or irritation.\r\n\r\nDavid says that even as a small child, he had the ability to ease pain. He describes it as having a natural \u201ctherapeutic touch\u201d that people\u2019s bodies respond to. Growing up, he would massage relatives complaining of pain as well as injured pets. Before deciding to start his own business in 1996, David had attained his license and worked with a chiropractor for four years. David says that his decision to start his own business came from him wanting to challenge himself personally and find his own path.  \r\n\r\nDavid is using this loan to buy tables and chairs for his business, as well as to increase his marketing efforts.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
