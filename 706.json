\n","en":"Kochkonbek is 54 years old, married and has two children.  Kochkonbek spent all his life working in the agricultural field, first starting as a driver at a collective farm and then as a handyman.  In search of an additional source of income for his family, he organized his own farm in 1996 with a starting capital of 5,000 som (KGS) and started to breed livestock and farm land.

The work Sadith does is selling clothes on credit, products she brings from the city of Lima because that\u2019s where the greatest variety and best quality clothes are.  \r\n\r\nShe\u2019s also a seamstress and works repairing one or another article of clothing for her customers.  This latter occupation she learned at an occupational center.  Thus her work day may start with her repairing a piece of clothing or in making an item since the afternoons are spent selling clothes.  Occasionally when she needs to earn extra income she bakes cakes on order for her customers.  She\u2019s been working this way for three years and has had her husband\u2019s unconditional support all this time. \r\n\r\nWhat she likes about her work is that it keeps her busy and generates income that allows her to cover household expenses and her children\u2019s education.  However, selling her clothes on credit sometimes means only a percentage profit because sometimes her customers take their time to pay her back.  Her greatest wish is to make her business grow and to open a store.\r\n\r\nThis would be her first MFP loan so she\u2019s hoping for support from all of you.

They chose the group name themselves but they weren\u2019t too sure about naming it thus because they wanted to call it \u201cVoladoras\u201d but opted for naming it \u201cMariposas\u201d since they liked it because it\u2019s an animal always headed forward.\r\n\r\nCristina, 48, has been married to Bruno for 32 years.  He works as a bricklayer and together they have a son who is 11 years old and in sixth graD. in elementary school.  His name is L. and he and his parents are very happy because he\u2019s about to finish his elementary education.\r\n\r\nCristina raises animals and this time has requested the loan to buy two lambs and two piglets.  She buys them when they are small and raises them to sell later.  She sold a short while ago so she only has three sheep left at home.  She comments that if she has any money left over she\u2019ll buy pasturage and corn.  \r\nShe\u2019s a little concerned about the price of corn because it\u2019s very expensive because the weather affected the corn crops.\r\n\r\nShe\u2019s been in this business for 30 years and has had no problem in all this time because she\u2019s always striven to care for them well and when she sees them sad she immediately takes them to the veterinarian to be checked over and so that they won\u2019t worsen.\r\n\r\nCristina\u2019s goal is that her son L. finishes his schooling, not only elementary school but that he succeed in becoming a great professional because they run out of money on many occasions and when she runs out is when she sells one or more of them to get out of their economic tough spot.\r\n\r\nThe members of the group are very grateful because they\u2019ve been working with FRAC for a long time and they are grateful because its help has been very useful for them especially to

The interview was of Miguelina who is married to Alberto with whom she had five children who are all now married.\r\n\r\nShe asked for the loan to buy merchandise like beans, oil, flour, cookies and soap, among others because she needs a few things that her customers need to buy and she is out of and that\u2019s what she needs the loan for to stock up on those products.\r\n\r\nTo launch this business she was encouraged by one of her daughters who gave her a little money to start out and have her own source of income and that\u2019s how she got started and she sees that it\u2019s producing results and her profits have improved somewhat.   What she wants is that with this activity and with the loans to continue working and that lenders will continue supporting her as long as God keeps her alive.\r\n\r\nThe group members are: Rosa Nelly

She feels proud of the work that she does.  She has been in this business for five years and, up to now, her partner has been the person who has supported her the most.  What Nilda enjoys about her business is having an income which she can use to cover her household needs and provide for her children.  However, her business has also had problems as she has suffered some thefts of her cows.  For this reason, she must now provide her stable with more security.\r\n\r\nThis will be Nilda's fourth loan from MFP.  She feels happy with the support that she is receiving and she considers the members of her community bank to be responsible people who are punctual in making their loan repayments.  She will use her loan to buy more wire so that she can improve the fence around her land in order to prevent anybody from stealing another of her cows."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":909595,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy wire to fence round her stable","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-11-03T22:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nilda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":600,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2011-11-05T10:16:22Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":353732,"name":"Ernesto","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Se\u00f1or Ernesto, de 76 a\u00f1os de edad, soltero, tiene 6 hijos de 30, 32, 40, 45,47 y 49 a\u00f1os de edad, el vive solo en la aldea Guacamaya, del progreso Yoro.\nDebido a su situaci\u00f3n, por  falta de una oportunidad de trabajo, decidi\u00f3 establecer un negocio propio  (pulper\u00eda), de venta de productos alimenticios de primera necesidad como granos b\u00e1sicos( arroz, sal, az\u00facar, manteca, especies, pan etc.), carne de pollo, queso, refrescos, churros, etc. \nEste negocio tiene 9 a\u00f1os, gracias a su buena administraci\u00f3n y los financiamientos  que a solicitado a ODEF,  a logrado incrementar su inventario.

The following women have left the group because their businesses are no longer functioning: Adelfa, Josefina, Ciria, Modesta, Magdalena, and Aurora.  Two women have joined the group, Sra. Castula and Sra. Violeta.  \r\n<p>\r\nOne of the members is Sra. Violeta, who sells blouses and traditional gowns.  She is 42 years and a single mother.  Even though she does not have a husband, Violeta is a strong woman who always gets what she wants.  She has been selling clothes for four years.  What she enjoys most about her business is that she can make blouses to her taste and put different colors and designs.  She also likes using her sewing machine because she has been drawn to this activity ever since she was a young girl.  Violeta has a nine-year-old son named Jos\u00e9 Miguel who is in elementary school.  He likes helping his mother with delivering the clothes she has made and collecting payments.  One of Violeta\u2019s dreams is to continue learning new things and also be able to make wedding gowns.  \r\n<p>\r\nShe is requesting a loan to buy more materials such as cloth, sewing machine thread (white and other colors), knitting hoops, needles, and elastics for making women\u2019s blouses.  What she likes most is using a knitting machine because it is fun and it has allowed her to learn new things.  \r\n<p>\r\nThe other members of the group are:\r\n\u2022\tMar\u00eda Divina sells blouses and napkins.\r\n\u2022\tLiliana sells napkins.\r\n\u2022\tNacariza sells napkins.\r\n\u2022\tCamelia sells napkins.\r\n\u2022\tMargarita sells napkins.\r\n\u2022\tAcacia sells blouses.\r\n\u2022\tModesta sells blouses and napkins.\r\n\u2022\tCastula sells napkins.  \r\n<p>\r\nThey are grateful to Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad for the support that has been given to them so that they can move forward and succeed in life and in their businesses.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2575,"image":{"id":907173,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"to buy cloth, sewing machine thread, knitting hoops, needles, and elastics.

This group is made up of hard-working women who all work in commerce and have requested this loan to invest in their businesses.\r\n\r\nLizbeth sells turkeys.  She will buy them young, raise them and then sell them.  Mar\u00eda Elena will buy lambs to raise and sell, Antonio will buy young chickens and turkeys to sell, Florentina will buy corn for her animals as she doesn't have any to give them, Alicia will buy building supplies as she has a building supplies business and Margarita will invest in her sewing workshop.\r\n\r\nMaribel is 32 years old.  She is a single mother and has two children: 10-year-old Cesar Gustavo and 7-year-old Viridiana.  Both of her children are in elementary school.  Cesar is in fifth grade and Viridiana is in third grade.  Maribel is a very hard-working person who takes advantage of her free time every afternoon to sell sheets and bedspreads.  In addition to selling her products in the afternoons, she also sells in her children's elementary school in the mornings.  She says that she has to put a lot of effort into her business as it is very difficult to support her two children on her own and she is also studying.  Maribel has been in her business for five years and, during this time, her problem has been that sometimes she hasn't had money and hasn't been able to stock her business.  Another of her problems has been that she sold on credit and people didn't want to pay her.  Now she no longer has that problem as she always works with people who she is certain will pay her.  On this occasion, she has requested a loan to invest in her business.  Maribel calculates that she will use 3,000 pesos to buy sheets and 3,000 pesos to buy bedspreads.\r\n\r\nOne of Maribel's goals is to grow her business but she would also like to start selling shoes, perfumes and Tupperware through catalogs.\r\n\r\nAll the members of this group are very grateful as the loan has helped them a lot and, above all, has helped them to get ahead."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3100,"image":{"id":909588,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products

Her business is growing corn.  She requested this loan to buy corn seed, fertilizer and herbicides, and to hire machinery for plowing her land and sowing her corn.  She will also use part of her money to replace the engine in her truck.  Her business is important because it earns her money.  She is very proud to be a farmer and she enjoys working in the fields together with her husband and her daughter.  She enjoys harvesting her corn, beans or tomatoes which she then sells.  She tells us that this business enabled her to build her house and get ahead in life.  Her business is popular because in this village everybody works the land, growing tomatoes.  The challenge that Francisca faces in her business is the amount she receives for her crops.  Sometimes they pay her very little.  She uses the profits that she makes to cover her household expenses, to buy pigs and chickens.\r\n\r\nFrancisca's hopes and dreams are for her children to do well and live happily with their families.

The distribution of farming inputs is part of One Acre Fund's integrated agriculture package, which includes training, reliable input (such as fertilizer and seed) supply, credit, and insurance. \r\n\r\nWith income from maize sales, Gilbert will educate his children, ensure food security for his family, and invest in livestock rearing. \r\n\r\nIn 2012, the members of Sosio group will each plant between \u00bd and one acre of maize. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":910131,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy farming inputs such as seeds and fertilizer at low prices for the 2012 planting season","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2011-11-10T00:50:24Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gilbert","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Asiya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"David","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nicasho","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Stela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Catherine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Moses","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":53900,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53900}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":575}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2011-11-12T09:26:39Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":354054,"name":"Miriam","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Miriam is a single woman who is 39 years old.

Before joining One Acre Fund, Sophia was only able to harvest eight bags of maize on one acre of land.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, One Acre Fund will purchase fertilizer, seeds, and other important inputs to distribute to Sophia and her group during Kenya\u2019s next planting season in February 2012. The distribution of farming inputs is part of One Acre Fund\u2019s integrated agriculture package, which includes training, reliable input supply (such as fertilizer and seeds), credit and insurance.\r\n\r\nWith income from her maize sales, Sophia will educate her children, ensure food security and invest in livestock.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, the members of Webanania S.H.G group will each plant between \u00bd and 1 acre of maize.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":902614,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To source farming inputs, such as seeds and fertilizer, at low prices for the 2012 planting season.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2011-11-10T19:20:20Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Benson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eunice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nixon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Norah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Susan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sophia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":66850,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66850}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":700}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2011-11-19T01:43:16Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":354078,"name":"Tujijure I Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Sylvestre est un commer\u00e7ant \u00e2g\u00e9 de 50ans qui habite la localit\u00e9 de Rutoki de la Province de Gitega au centre du pays.
