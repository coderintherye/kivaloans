C. lives in Namaacha, Mozambique, very close to the Swazi border. She was born in the capital of the country, Maputo, 42 years ago. She moved to Namaacha because she got a job there, working for TDM, the national telecommunications company. She has been working there for the last 23 years.\r\n\r\nShe is studying 10th grade at the moment and plans to continue until 12th grade, the last year before undergraduate university level. She studies by night at the local secondary school. She is single and has four children, aged 7, 10, 19 and 21. All of them go to school, the three youngest in Namaacha and the oldest one in Maputo. She needs to take care of all four children on her own.\r\n\r\nShe explains that she previously asked Kiva for a loan to start a clothes selling business, but the business did not turn out well. The main problem was that people were taking the clothes home and promising to pay at a later date but ultimately never paid, so she had to close her business. She is determined now not to make the same mistake again and wants to have a small shop. She says that people will pay or not take the items home so she will not have the same problem again.\r\n\r\nShe is not sure of what to sell yet, so she is asking for a loan just to build the stall this time. Once the stall is built, she will decide what is best for her to sell and ask for another loan. She is confident she will be able to repay without problems, since she has her fixed salary in the telecom company and has some savings."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":524161,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to build a stall

Her experience in this business has taught her to value that virtue of being cordial to clientele in whatever genre of business one operates. Given the nature of her business where competition is cutthroat, this attribute has come in really handy.\n\nThe 67-year-old mother of five divulges that, on the basis of her good human relationship skills, she has been able to make commendable strides in the improvement of her family\u2019s welfare ever since she began her business.

She has three years of experience in the sale of cosmetics despite being so young.  She is a very responsible person who, in addition to becoming independent from her parents, had to start earning her own money to study.  It was hard for her to do both, financially and time-wise, but she figured out how to get ahead and now everything is going well for her.  One of her desires is to dedicate herself to her profession.  Right now, she needs money to be able to get promotional products from the catalog and in this way sell more merchandise.

A la question de savoir pourquoi elle a choisi Turame, elle a r\u00e9pondu que Turame donne un cr\u00e9dit sans demander des garanties mat\u00e9rielles comme le font les autres institutions de micro-finance.

She is 30 and was able to attend school through 6th grade. She is married and the mother of five children, three sons and two daughters who are 15, 12, 8, 4 and 18 months. Only two are enrolled in school. She is in good health and affirms that she has no problems in life. \r\n\r\nAs a banana juice saleswoman, she chose to take out a loan from Turame because she was incapable of continuing her work with financial support. \r\nShe has just finished repaying her first loan of 100,000 Fbu. Her present loan request is for 180,000 which will be used to buy bananas. Asked why she chose Turame, she replied that Turame gives loans without requiring collateral the way other microfinance institutions do. She can't therefore leave Turame until she is financially independent. \r\n\r\nAs for her business, she gets up at two a.m. to prepare the banana juice which she then brings to her little juice stand. She only goes home when she has finished selling her juice. Normally, she never has difficulty selling all of it every day. \r\n\r\nShe hopes to have a happy life, both physically and materially. As for her children, she wants to be able to send them to school so that they also become able to live comfortably. She hopes to open a general store after her second loan with Turame is paid off. In conclusion, she encourages others to request loans through Turame, since Turame does not require anything before it gives out loans. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva

The solar lantern offers a free, environment-friendly, renewable source of energy, that allows them to reduce their monthly fuel costs.   \r\n\t\t\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon \u2014 a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":75,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":75,"image":{"id":523993,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

Maylen has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon for 2 years now and earns a living by running a food vending business. She is purchasing a solar lantern with a PHP 3,100 loan from NWTF to extend her productive hours, while at the same time cut fuel costs and save money in the long run.\t\r\n\t\r\nAbout NWTF\u2019s Green Loan Products\r\nNegros Women for Tomorrow Foundation believes that the key to poverty alleviation for the poorest is to provide services beyond just credit. To that end, NWTF offers green energy products designed to save money for its clients. In a partnership with SunTransfer and Arc Finance, NWTF distributes solar-powered lanterns that also function as a charging station for mobile phones. Since many families normally use kerosene lamps to light their homes, the solar lantern offers a free, environment-friendly renewable source of energy, that allows them to reduce their monthly fuel costs.   \r\n\t\t\r\nAbout NWTF\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

V. is a married woman who lives in Bool, Cartagena, Sipalay City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by selling fish. Alma\u2019s husband Jaime, is a tricycle driver, and they have 5 children who are between 1 and 11 years old. Three of their children are currently going to school and also help in the business as part of their daily chores.\r\n\r\nAlma joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve the quality of life of their family. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD she has been able to increase their family income by engaging in fish vending. Now she earns an average monthly income of PHP 12,000 from her business activities.\r\n\r\nAlma is a member of good standing. Her previous loan of PHP 40,000 was used to fund the operations of her fish vending business, and it had a positive impact in both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is borrowing her 13th cycle loan in the amount of PHP 40,000, which she intends to also use for her fish vending business. Alma is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, such as providing them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":522805,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish

L. is a 47-year old married woman who supports her family by buying and selling rice, pig fattening and sugarcane farming. She lives in Hda. Bearin, Brgy Linao Kabankalan City, Negros Occidental with her husband who is a driver and also helps her run the business. They have 4 children who are between 12 and 21 years old, all of whom still go to school.\r\n\r\nMadolyn has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2000 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in all of her business activities she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 15,000.\r\n\r\nMadolyn is now borrowing PHP 20,000 to use on her business activities of rice sales, pig fattening and sugarcane farming. This will be her 23rd cycle loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 20,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Madolyn aspires to elevate her family\u2019s living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the \u201cDungganon\u201d way.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":522867,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"For

M. is a 42-year old married woman who lives in Hda Bearin Brgy Linao Kabankalan City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by buying and selling coconut wine, running a cafeteria, selling barbecue and pig fattening.\r\n\r\nJocelyn\u2019s husband Samuel works as a guard at a sugarcane plantation. They have 6 children who are between 6 and 23 years old, 2 of their children are currently going to school and help their parents in the business as part of their daily chores, while the rest work to help the family.\r\n\r\nJocelyn joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve the quality of life of their family. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD she has been able to increase their family income by engaging in multiple business activities of buying and selling coconut wine, running a cafeteria, selling barbecue and pig fattening. Now she earns an average monthly income of PHP 18,800 from her business activities.\r\n\r\nJocelyn is a member of good standing. Her previous loan of PHP 28,000 was used to fund operations of her various business activities, and it had a positive impact in both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is borrowing her 26th loan cycle in the amount of PHP 29,000, which she intends to use on all of her business concerns, in varying degrees.

She lives in the commune of Rugombo (Cibitoke Province).   Her husband is an elderly farmer; she sells kerosene which is used in many rural households for kerosene lamps. This is a business that she has been in for one year, whereas she just lived from farming before that. She was able to rise above the physically demanding work of farming thanks to Turame.  \r\n\r\nCassilde is the mother of 8 children, three daughters and five sons, of whom two are already married. Three of them are students, but she is also responsible for the school fees of two other children, one of whom is an orphan from her family. She hopes that her children will be able to finish their studies successfully so that they can help her when she is old. \r\n\r\nWith the Kiva loan, she is counting on adding to her working capital and her business, by buying kerosene in bulk to grow her income and thus be able to cover her day-to-day expenses for food, school fees, and other household costs. Since she sometimes sells on credit to some of her customers, she affirms that she sometimes has trouble with late payments from these customers. \r\n\r\nShe is very grateful for Turame's and Kiva's initiatives since no collateral is needed in order to request a loan, contrary to banks and other microfinance institutions.

The five older ones are adults and the two younger ones attend school. They live together in their own house located in a neighbourhood of Ayacucho. When he was 9 years old, he used to help his parents sell fruit, but when he was older he learned a new trade and became a farmer. For that reason and because he now has a family, his job is growing and selling cocoa and citrus fruits. His business is doing well.\r\n\r\nHis wife and children often help out, but generally he needs assistance from farm labourers to bring in the harvest. The produce is then sold in local warehouses.\r\n\r\nA future project for Saturnino is to learn about the sale of cattle so that he can expand his business and increase his income. This is his fourth loan with Kiva partner MFP, and he promises to make his repayments puncutally. He is pleased with the benefits received via the community group.

This will fetch her more profit and motivate her to go for her dream of owning a well-established bar and also enable her to sustain her family\u2019s needs.\n\nGrace belongs to a group who hold each other accountable and insure one another in paying back the loan because they want to access the future successfully.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2325,"image":{"id":524259,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pub","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase more beers, wine and sodas for her bar business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kyenjojo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2010-04-20T21:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Grace","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Clovis","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Stephen","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatrice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paul","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Josephine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Stella","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatrice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Annet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Resty","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cordelia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adolf","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Innocent","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edwin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"John","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"David","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vicent","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Regina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":4800000,"loan_amount":2325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1200000},{"due_date":"2010-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1200000},{"due_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1200000},{"due_date":"2010-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1200000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":581.25},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":581.25},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":581.25},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":581.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":581.25,"local_amount":1200000,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:54:18Z","rounded_local_amount":1203199.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136733984,"comment":null},{"amount":528.7,"local_amount":1091500,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:49:47Z","rounded_local_amount":1094410.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144767283,"comment":null},{"amount":592.39,"local_amount":1223000,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-20T07:46:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1226260.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152662301,"comment":null},{"amount":622.66,"local_amount":1285500,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:47:02Z","rounded_local_amount":1288927.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159689074,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-04-24T01:32:19Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:47:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":193106,"name":"Fatoumata","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Madame  Fatoumata S.  est \u00e2g\u00e9e de 58 ans, mari\u00e9e et m\u00e8re de 6 enfants.

She took very early an interest in income generating activities and, since she was born into a family of merchants, she began to work with her mother who sold food condiments, clothes and kitchen utensils. She tried several activities and finally decided to specialize in the trade of calabashes. She has been in this business for 29 years and enjoys a solid reputation among her many customers.\r\n\r\nShe wanted to increase her working capital to meet her customers' demand and came to the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso. She has worked with this institution for 54 months. She was granted 3 solidarity loans and 3 individual loans, which have all been repaid on schedule. This is her fourth individual loan. She will use it to buy 100 packages of calabashes in the villages surrounding S\u00e9gou. She sells for cash and credit to a clientele made up exclusively of women.\r\n\r\nMrs Fatoumata S. expects to earn 75,000 CFA francs a month, which she will use to buy a cart and a refrigerator.

She sells chipa (a kind of bread made from starch obtained from yucca or cassava, maize flour, cheese, lard, and milk).

When she gets home from work, she has to do the household chores and everything else that will help her family get ahead as she is a single mother.\r\n\r\nThe loan will be used to cover various

During planting and harvesting season, she needs the help of farm workers. Roc\u00edo is at her small farm from 7:00 AM to 6:00 PM during the week, which is why her sales have been gradually increasing since her produce is sold at the wholesale centers in her community.

She has worked for 24 years selling dairy products and cheese in Chixoles, the village where she lives.  Her husband delivers the products on his bicycle.  They also work selling livestock.  She is known by her customers and identifies with them as she is a kind person.  She begins work very early to arrive on time to distribute her products.  She thanks God that she is already well-known and her clientele keeps increasing.  For this reason she is asking for a loan to buy a milk cow since her current cow does not produce enough to fill the orders.

She has a business selling food in her home every night.  In addition to this, she also is a traveling saleswoman of new and used clothing.  She started to work in this business ten years ago, due to a lack of work.  Also, her mother had previously sold food out of her home, and this served as the inspiration for her business.  The loan she is requesting will be used to buy summer clothing, as Holy Week is approaching and she wants to take advantage of this opportunity to sell her products.  She desires to travel to Managua to buy the summer articles below market value and then sell them from her home.  Her dream has always been to start a store in her home that will provide for her family economically and support her son financially so that he can study in the university.  \r\n\r\n<br

They will also invest in an advertising campaign to increase their market share, now that they have moved from their original location and have acquired a location across from the home of their in-laws.  They invested two months and all of their savings in preparing the location.  Now they must begin again because they have gotten disconnected from their customers.  This is a setback, but they have new products and have extended their business hours in order to become well know once more.  Their dream is to establish a solid economic base so that they can secure a good education for their children.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Hugo Reyes, Kiva

It is located in the south-east part of the city and has a population of 50 million.  Milena began her business of selling perfumes, clothing, shoes, and cosmetics five years ago because she needed to earn her own income.  She got a loan from her family and since she is well organized, was able to grow her business over time.  Now she is requesting a loan of 2,000,000 COP ($1,050) in order to invest in shoes, men\u2019s and women\u2019s clothing, and other items that she features in her catalog, such as children\u2019s and ladies accessories and perfumes.\r\n\r\nShe\u2019s been working with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo for the past year, where she has made good use of her loan.  She was able to increase her working capital and its usefulness, which gave her access to new services.  This enabled her to improve her quality of life.\r\n\r\nHer primary goal is to make her business stand out by creating an infrastructure that will allow her to showcase her products.  In other words, she would like to have her own point of sale.  Her dream is that her young son gets the best education possible and she is working toward that.  Now her only challenge is collecting the money that some of her customers owe her, because some have not kept up with their payments and she has had to be patient and renegotiate their debts.

La situaci\u00f3n se complic\u00f3  y la crisis en el pa\u00eds vecino se agudiz\u00f3,  por lo que tuvo que cerrar la f\u00e1brica e irse a vivir a M\u00e9rida donde empez\u00f3 a trabajar el calzado sobre medida. En el a\u00f1o 1977 decidi\u00f3 regresar a Colombia e instalarse en Malambo cerca de su familia, organiz\u00f2 su taller con 3 empleados y hoy est\u00e1 en proceso de expansi\u00f3n ya que su experiencia y la calidad de sus productos les han permitido comenzar a trabajar con almacenes que comercializan calzado reconocidos en la ciudad de Barranquilla. \u00c9l espera posicionarse en el mercado con las grandes cadenas de almacenes por eso ha legalizado su negocio. Sus desaf\u00edos mas importantes  fueron las crisis que vivi\u00f3 con la recesi\u00f3n de Venezuela, pero \u00e9l siempre esta dispuesto a seguir luchando y volver a comenzar como hasta el momento lo ha hecho en la poblaci\u00f3n de Malambo.\n \n\n\n","en":"Gustavo S. P., 61, originally from Bucaramanga, also known as the city of parks, is a great entrepreneur who lives in the Granada de Malambo neighborhood, part of Barranquilla\u2019s metropolitan area.  He is a cobbler, as are many of his neighbors in this area, who manufacture shoes and sports sandals which are then sold in small stores.\r\n\r\nGustavo became aware of the Fundaci\u00f3n Santo Domingo through two close neighbors who are clients.  He is asking for funding in the amount of $1.500.000 to buy materials and supplies like: 500 pairs of insoles, 50 meters of synthetic shoe leather and supplies such as adhesives and thread.\r\n\r\nGustavo learned this skill, a family tradition, precisely in his father\u2019s workshop when he was about to finish high school.  When he turned 21, after having worked for a year in a shoe manufacturing firm, he used is severance pay to set up his own business.  He started out with just one motor and 12 shoe molds.  A year later, he moved to Venezuela to run his own firm where he grew to have 45 employees.\r\n\r\nThe situation became complicated and the crisis in the neighboring country became acute to such an extent that he had to close his factory and move to the city of M\u00e9rida where he began to make custom order shoes.\r\n\r\nIn 1977 he returned to Colombia and settled in Malambo near his family; he set up a workshop with three employees and he\u2019s now in the process of expanding because his experience and the quality of his products has made it possible for him to start collaborating with large, well-known shoe stores in Barranquilla.\r\n\r\nHe hopes to position himself with the large chain department stores so he has all the legal permits for his business.

It is also known as \u201cLa Ciudad de las Flores\u201d (The City of the Flowers).  This area is famous nationally for its tourist and religious festivities.  It is located 20 minutes from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nFor many years she has been selling flowers outside of the cemetery in the city of Ferre\u00f1afe.  She works at this business on the week-ends because that is when there are a large number of people who visit the graveyard.  This activity constitutes an important source of economic help to the family.  Her husband is a farmer, and this does not produce income in a permanent way.\r\n\r\nA few months ago Mercedes, with much effort, got a \u201cmototaxi\u201d (three wheeled motorized vehicle used to transport cargo and passengers).  She gets additional income from the mototaxi.  The vehicle is driven by her son.  He travels the city of Monsef\u00fa and the outlying rural communities offering his services.\r\n\r\nThe continual usage of the vehicle and the rough state of the roads that join the city of Monsef\u00fa with its rural communities have caused the mototaxi to start to have some problems.  These require urgent repair to make it operate correctly.  She also wants to pay for all of the documentation that permits her to legally offer taxi services.  That is why she is requesting a loan for 2,000 PEN from Edpyme Alternativa to help her achieve her objective.\r\n\r\nMercedes is a hard-working woman who is devoted to her family.  Her greatest desire is to continue growing as a businesswoman to be able to give her family a better quality of life.  She has previously worked with our institution.  She has demonstrated punctuality and responsibility at the time of making her payments.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

In turn, she was able to engage in business activities and to thereby improve her standard of living. Gloria recently successfully repaid a prior loan in the amount of 6,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to to purchase new items in order to expand her product offering. Gloria is now requesting another loan, this time in the amount of 8,000 PHP (though the total loan amount being sought by the group is 29,000 PHP, or $650), which will be used to purchase additional inventory and expand her working capital.

She has a well-rounded experience of ten years in pig husbandry and agricultural produce sales.\r\n\r\nIn Nanzoga, Mpigi, Samali has established a business niche for herself on the basis of her down-the-line hard-work spirit.  She has had financial difficulties in her piggery business before but, given her beaten-track experience, she has managed to nip them in the bud earlier.\r\n\r\nIn the same breath, what has also made Samali\u2019s produce sales business successful is the fact that she has always owed it to herself to provide the best possible quality produce for her clients.

She lives in the Soledad 2000 neighborhood. She\u2019s married, has a 6-year old child, and has worked in a business sewing pajamas, multi-purpose comforters and bags for 12 years. With the goal of having more diversity in her offerings and growing her market, she is requesting a loan of $1,500,000.00, with which she will buy materials for sewing, such as carriages, thread and lining. \r\n<p>\r\nMarly has been doing very well. When she began her business 12 years ago, she was producing only bags. Gradually, she learned to make multi-purpose comforters and pajamas. She has to buy a special tool for this type of sewing, and later she added three more machines. Since she has begun with the Fundaci\u00f3n, she has improved her living conditions and augmented the production in her small business, reflecting a better infrastructure in her teams. Her dream is to continue growing her business, so that it will be big enough to sell her products in other plazas along the Caribbean Coast. Amongst her challenges is to always be effective and healthy to achieve her dreams. \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Rebecca Towle, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":524924,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"To buy materials for sewing, such as carriages, thread and lining.

F. who, at 68 years of age, continues to be a pleasant, kind woman with great charisma for interpersonal relationships.  She has a small sales case at the entrance to this shopping center where she sells delicious snacks, beverages and assorted sweets that she buys from distributors in her neighborhood for cash.  This is why she\u2019s asking Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo for her second loan, valued at $800.000 to buy soft-drinks, sweets and snacks so that she will always be well-stocked and ready to sell her products.\r\n\r\nShe started out in 1996 selling lottery tickets in Barranquilla\u2019s streets when that was a very profitable business.  Her present business replaced the original one because lottery sales declined and the industry became more technological.  Aida has much capacity for work; her work day extends from 10am until 11pm every day of the week.  Her customers are pedestrians that amble by, owners of other local businesses, stationary sellers of assorted merchandise and knickknacks.\r\n\r\nShe began her collaboration with FMSD three years ago; her loans have helped her increase her business by being able to permanently have stock available.  This has been very important because she hasn\u2019t had to take out other nickel and dime loans.  \r\n\r\nHer great dream is to improve her dwelling and she now has the added challenge of trying to adjust her work schedule in order to take a bit of daily rest to enjoy her crowded and cheerful La Ciudadela 20 D. Julio neighborhood which is full of commercial activities and recreational centers, like \r\nMetropolitan Stadium, where the football team, \u201cEl Junior D. Barranquilla,\u201d which is the passion of many coastal residents, plays.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva

He is single and lives in his own house with his mother, Sabina, 81 years old, whom he cares for with dedication. His profession is primary school teacher. Nevertheless, his love for the land where he was born has led him to raise citrus fruits, avocados, and bananas, and he has done this independently for 40 years. He has carried out this activity alone or with the help of workmen whom he hires for planting and harvesting. What he likes most is harvest time. When he sees his products of good quality and good size, he knows that it is due to the effort and dedication that he put into his land. At the same time, it is difficult for him to transport his products to the markets in the city or to the collection centers to sell them. In the future, he plans to buy a house in the city, where he can set up a shop that will generate profits for him. He would also like to buy more farms near his present home. \r\n<p>\r\nThis is his first loan with MFP, and as he is a respectable person in his community bank, he promises to make the payments on time, so that he can continue accessing more credit in the future and not betray the confidence that they have shown in him.

Sarah was determined to improve her own and her family\u2019s quality of life and in January 2010, she opened up a child daycare center.\r\n\r\nSarah charged to her credit card $2000 worth of materials, toys, and decor and converted her living room into a children\u2019s playland. Her current CDA (Child Development Associate) license allows her to take care of five children. As more parents have expressed interest in her services she has now applied for a CDA license that will allow her to take care of ten children. She has hired two part-time assistants and they are currently being reviewed for their CDA credentials.  \r\n\r\nAs her business continues to grow rapidly, Sarah came to ACCION USA for a microloan that would help her expand her daycare with more toys, puzzles, books, instruments, paints, and nap mats that could accommodate the children that are on her wait-list. She has calculated that once she is taking care of ten children she will be able to pay herself a full-time salary and as well as paying the two part-time assistants.\r\n\r\nSarah says she feels blessed to be a business owner, especially because it has allowed her time to dedicate to her daughter and husband.

She has two children, one of whom lives with her in her house. For Irene every day is a a constant battle to improve no matter what adversity she faces. For 30 years she has worked growing corn, alfalfa, oats, and various kinds of flowers on her land. She also raises two cows that give her 15 liters of milk a day, which she sells to acquaintances. Sometimes she gets help from her youngest son, but she normally works alone. Thanks to her work she can live comfortably, and she has been able to buy four more pieces of farmland in front of her house. This makes it easy to care for her land and she can enjoy the freshly cut grass and the smells of the green countryside. This is her first loan with MFP and she hopes to continue working with them and investing her loan money well. With this loan she will buy feed for her cows and three bags of organic fertilizer to spread over her crops to increase production.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patrick King,

This group is made up of young members who have the desire to get ahead and expand their businesses. Juan Oscar is single, and he has just finished his studies in the field of Odontology. He wants to open his own clinic and also continue specialized studies. He needs the loan in order to open his clinic, so he can work and pay for his night classes. The other members work in a range of fields, such as making and selling pastries; selling cosmetics and clothing from a catalog; selling books or CDs; or serving customers in a liquor store. Others work in public relations, in spite of their young age. Despite the fact that there is heavy competition in all of these fields, the members know where to go, how to make contacts, and what seasons are best for each product; in short, they have a lot of experience. Some of the members will use the loan to buy specialized books; others will buy merchandise; and the publicist will use it for a video recorder. The greatest expectation shared by this group of young people is to be able to finish their studies, because many of them are working full-time in their careers due to their need to support themselves. Some of these members have worked in the past with other financial institutions, and some have worked with our institution in the past. In spite of being young, they want to get ahead, expand their businesses and become better every day. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman, Kiva
