the life conditions became completely unbearable, Salima went to sell on a market. This was 6 years ago. For the last several years, Salima\u2019s husband has been away working as a seasonal laborer in Russia. He earns very little. The irregular money transfers that he sends are not enough to pay for necessities. Salima has 3 children. One of her daughters is mentally retarded and sits at home. Salima tries anything that might bring extra income. She specializes in sale of dried fruits (apricots and prunes). During the summer, when melons and watermelons appear on the market, Salima switches to sell them. Salima\u2019s older daughter helps her mother to sell. Over the 5 months of being a MicroInvest borrower, Salima demonstrated that MicroInvest loans made a noticeable difference in her business. Salima plans to continue her relationship with MicroInvest, as the loans she receives help her sustain her business.<p><b>Translated from Russian by Aleksandr Zhuk, Kiva

took her first MicroInvest loan to process and dry apricots. The loan brought Muazzamhon a nice profit, so she decided to do it again. Muazzamhon, 39 is married and has 4 children\u20142 boys and 2 girls. Her husband works on \u201cnonvoykhone\u201d (a bakery that produces Tajik traditional bread\u2014<i>lavash<\/i>). The money that Muazzamhon\u2019s husband makes is enough only to buy food and nothing else. A few years ago, Muazzamhon started her business. Gradually expanding, she rented a trading spot in a store. Now, Muazzamhon sells clothing for children and shoes for all ages. Once a week, she travels to buy her goods from a wholesaler located 170 km away from her home. Muazzamhon has many regular customers and the profit that her business makes constitutes a sizable contribution to her family\u2019s budget. School season is approaching, and Muazzamhon asks for a loan to order school uniforms."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":53033,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to expand

She started her business 4 years ago, when she first began to sell. Initially, she helped her mother, but then Firuza began to deliver and sell her goods independently. Her assortment of goods includes rubber shoes, which she sells in the summer. In the winter, Firuza switches to selling winter clothing for children. Firuza gets help from her two younger sisters.

has lived her whole life in the presence of fish. Her father was a fisherman, and caught trout in the local rivers near Trujillo, Peru, where she grew up. When she turned 20 years old, Maria opened a small \u201ccevicheria,\u201d adjacent to her home, and served the trout, cooked without heat by marinating the meat in limejuice. Seven years ago, her husband abandoned her for another woman, and Maria was left to care for her 3 children alone.<p>Deciding to make a fresh start, Maria moved to Ayacucho, Peru, where she had distant relatives. She used her savings to rent a counter section at the central market, where she sells her ceviche and sodas to up to 50 customers a day. She can be found at her stall, which is equipped with a sink and preparation area, 7 days a week, from about 9 am until quite late at night, or until her supply of fish runs out. Dressed in the traditional white chef hat and apron, Maria exudes experience and professionalism. A steady stream of customers visits her kiosk, and business really picks up during the lunch hour. She serves a generous portion of the diced fish, with potatoes, onions, and a lettuce garnish.<p>For her next loan, Maria hopes to receive US$500. For now, her stall is modestly equipped with the most basic utilities. She would use the money from this loan for a small refrigeration device that she could install under the preparation counter. For now, Maria must store the fish, which comes frozen twice a week from Lima, at her home, and prepare the ceviche there as well. With refrigeration at her kiosk she would not have to carry the heavy dishes to work, and would be able to avoid the risk of running out of food on a busy day.<p>Maria V. belongs to a village bank called \u201cAyni\u201d which is a quechua (native language) word that means \u201cI help you now, you help me later\u201d.  So Maria has friends in her village bank like Benita Sierra.

Feliciana C. D. G. is 51 years old, is married, and has 6 sons.  The sons are of ages 32, 30, 23, 21, 20, and 14 and they all still live with her in the house.  Even though she was not able to finish her studies and attain a high school diploma, she opened her own convenience store from her residence where she serves everybody in the neighborhood, selling goods of prime need. In the store, she works with her husband and the two youngest who go out and sell their goods to those who can\u2019t go to their store.  The eldest sons all work independently.<p> \r\nShe confronted several hardships along the way since nobody wanted to hire her or give her any loans and so she started from nothing.  She started out by cleaning clothes for families and did some fishing.  In time, she was able to save enough money to start her convenience store.

R. , 38, has a little store (a tienda) up in the hills above Nebaj. Her house and store are surrounded by cornfields, but her family does not own any land beyond their house. She opened the tienda two years ago when she received her first loan. In her tienda she sells water, juice, bananas, oil, salt, fruits and other staples that her neighbors will stop by and purchase. Because there is not much work for the people in her town, they did not have money to buy her weavings so she turned to operating a tienda as a continuing source of income.\r\n<br\/><br\/>\r\nMaria is married and has 7 children. The youngest two school-age children have not started school yet because she does not have the money for clothes and school supplies. She herself never attended school and therefore cannot read, write, or do addition. Her older children help her in the tienda when there are sums to be done. Their schooling is already paying off. \r\n<br\/><br\/>\r\nMaria does still do some weaving. Her specialty is weaving huipils, a traditional top worn by most women in the village of Nebaj. She can produce one in 15 days and sells in the market for up to US$200. \r\n<br\/><br\/>\r\nEven though her husband makes money driving a little three-wheeled taxi (called a tuc-tuc, pronounced Tuuk-Tuuk), her dream is to have enough food daily to feed her family.  A major struggle is buying medicine for when a member of her family is ill which luckily is not often.

C., 42 years old, weaves traditional Mayan woman\u2019s clothing, including belts called fajas, exquisite tops called huilpiles and head dressings called cintas. One huilpil can take up to two months to make depending on the design, and sells for up to US$200. Some of the designs tell a story of the region and others are unique designs created by the artist.  A hair piece called a cinta  can take up to 15 days to create and can sell for US$35. As with all traditional women's clothing in the mountains of Guatemala, the special designs signify what village a woman comes from. \r\n<P>\r\nThis loan will be used to buy more yarn for weaving.

He and his wife sell personal care products.  These include shampoo, tooth paste, hair coloring, products to take care of the body and many other things.  Demand for these types of products is high and brings steady profits.  In addition to selling his products at the markets, Zafar sells his products from home where he has a small store.  Recently his business had a hard period, when the tax authorities demanded that he get a special license to sell self-care products.  The costs of such a license are too high and would not have allowed Zafar to earn a profit.  This type of license is used for wholesale dealers.  Today, the issue has been resolved and the special license is not necessary.  <p>\r\n\r\nA year ago Zafar received a loan from MicroInvest and included more expensive shampoos and soaps in his inventory.  This attracted many customers and increased profits.  He purchases his products by traveling to wholesale markets and also receives deliveries from wholesale dealers.

is 48 years old.  Her husband passed away and left her with 7 children.  In addition to her there are 16 other members of her family that live together: 2 sons with their families and 4 non-adult daughters.  The oldest daughter recently got married and lives with her husband.  <p>\r\n\r\nSources of income need to be found to feed such a large quantity of people.  The two sons drive people in vans on local routes, while Salomat sells traditional Tajik flatbread at the market.  She has been doing this for several years.  Early in the morning one of her sons drives the flatbread to the market, helps her to arrange it on the counter and then leaves for his job.  One of the daughters helps Salomat to sell.  Salomat has many regular clients and she sells all of her flatbread in 3 hours.  5 months ago the price of flatbread increased slightly and Salomat decided to get a loan from MicroInvest.  The loan brought additional profits and since then she has been borrowing continuously.  She plans to use the new loan to further expand her business.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Russian by Sabina Holzman, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\u0421\u0430\u043b\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0442 48

is a teacher by profession and works in a high school.  She is 44 years old and is married, but does not have children.  Her husband is in Russia earning money.  A teacher\u2019s salary is not enough to live on, so she sells goods at the markets.  Her sister Nasiba helps her.  Muattar specialized in children\u2019s clothing and footwear.  The profits from her business help her to cover part of the family expenditures.  <p>\r\n\r\nHer past loan from MicroInvest helped Muattar to expand her small business.  She plans on using the new loan to purchase school uniforms.  In the photo is her sister Nasiba.

and her husband are businesspeople.  Dilbar sells socks and various small goods and her husband sells spare auto parts.  She is 33 years old and has 3 small children.  Her business experience of around 6 years is relatively large.  Dilbar started in business by selling children\u2019s clothing, but soon transitioned to selling small goods (men\u2019s and women\u2019s socks, handkerchiefs, etc.) since this brings higher profits and there is no leftover inventory.  Dilbar\u2019s mother-in-law watches her children so that Dilbar can work at the market.  <p>\r\n\r\nDilbar has been borrowing money from MicroInvest for 2 years.  She started by borrowing $100.  Slowly she increased the amounts that she has borrowed until she had reached her current loan request of $1000, which she will use to increase her inventory.\r\n\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Russian

works on a collective farm.  He is married and has 3 children.  At home he has farm animals and every year his family and he dry apricots.  He takes apricots from the collective farm that are allocated to him for his work.  He also purchases apricots from other farmers in order to increase his profits.  The prices for dried apricots increase as winter gets closer and Husen then sells them.  The profits go towards family expenditures.  <p>\r\n\r\nLast year Husen got a loan from MicroInvest for the purchase of apricots.  That loan brought him good profits.  This year he plans on getting a new loan for the processing and storage of dried apricots.

Dominican Republic. They ran a beauty parlor there for several months before relocating to Santo Domingo with their families. Their shop has been in its new location for 8 months and is doing very well. Angela Maria has four children and Ricarda has one child (seen here in photo). They all live together in the same house with their mother, and the salon is located in an extension of the house.  Even though the shop is small, they can work on at least two customers at the same time. \r\n<p>\r\nAngela and Ricarda have applied for a loan in part to buy a small power generator so that their shop can continue to operate during the eight to ten hours a day when the electricity is out in their neighborhood.  \r\n<p>\r\nThey are also interested in opening up a new business with their partner, Jocelyn B., to sell natural and herbal remedies produced by a company called Natura International. To make this possible, Angela and Ricarda have applied for loans of $350 each, and Jocelyn for a loan of $200, for a total of $900.  \r\n<p>\r\nSale of natural and herbal remedies is a recent development in this area, but  the activity sounds very promising. Until this business has proved itself, however, securing loans will be difficult. But we believe the fact that these three women are working together to make it happen is a good sign that bodes well for repayment of the loan. Also, the beauty parlor is profitable and can help them withstand early losses from the newer herbal business. That's one reason why, for purposes of this loan, we are considering these women as part of one team."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":53393,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Natural Medicines","sector":"Health","use":"Emergency power plant and sales of  herbal medicine.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"DO","country":"Dominican Republic","town":"Juanita Community of Santo Domingo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"19 -70.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":66,"posted_date":"2007-08-11T00:55:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Angela, Ricarda \/joc","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-08-25T17:54:31Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":900,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2007-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2007-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2007-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2008-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2008-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":150}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2007-09-25T09:21:41Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-25T10:07:16Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":58566,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2007-10-25T09:26:25Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-25T10:07:16Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":71879,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2007-11-25T10:30:45Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-25T10:07:16Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86577,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2007-12-25T10:20:57Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-25T10:07:16Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":102692,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2008-01-25T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-25T10:07:16Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":121654,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2008-02-25T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-25T10:07:16Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":142035,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2007-08-11T17:54:31Z","paid_date":"2008-02-25T10:07:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":15815,"name":"Hai","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Hai H., 32 years old, lives in Kampong Cham and earns a living selling fish and raising pigs.

is 32 years old, he is married and has 1 child. Abdusamad began his business 5 years ago by offering computer services to the clients. Eventually, he expanded the business and added new services, such as connecting to mobile operators and increasing the balance on special cards that are used to add money to the account. Because of the technologies involved, this business requires capital investments. In addition, the business employs two people that receive salaries. With his first microcredit from MicroInvest, Abdusamad purchased a fax machine, a scanner, and cards to add money to the account. Currently, he is planning to purchase a new computer and is, therefore, asking for a new microcredit loan.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Anna Startseva, Kiva

The requested loan is to do the rough construction of two rooms using brick. Due to his payment history with IMPRO, he is considered a \"preferential customer\" and is approved for a new loan.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated by Ramon F.

Rajabhon and her elderly mother live with the brother's family. Her brother has a large family, and to not be a burden on him, Rajabhon trades on the market. She has 8 years of experience purchasing dried fruit on one market, sorting through it, and then reselling quality fruit on another market.  Her mother helps her. The financial gain is small, but it helps to cover the costs. <p>\r\nRajabhon received her first microcredit loan from MicroInvest 2 years ago; she used the money to purchase fresh apricots and dry them with the help of her family. Since then, she has been receiving loans from MicroInvest.<p>\r\nIn August, the price for dried fruit is low, and Rajabhon would like to receive a new loan to purchase and store dried fruit. In January and February, when the prices rise, Rajabhon will be able to receive good profit from her sales.\r\n<p><b> Translated from Russian by Anna Startseva<p><b>

Over this time, big changes happened in her life. In the past, Munira had no house of her own. Since she started her business, by putting aside a fraction of the profits, Munira was able to buy a parcel of land and begin a house construction. Munira, 35 is married and has 3 children. Her husband has no permanent job and puts all his efforts to help her wife in her challenging business. Munira buys dried apricots and pit. She and her family then sort the purchases and re-sell them based on the sorted grades. With help of MicroInvest loans, Munira significantly increased the asset value of her business. Following Munira\u2019s advice, many other women, who sell dried fruits, became MicroInvest borrowers.

Mukunga M. is a soft-spoken, 27-year-old single gentleman.

He offers Internet services, photocopying, word processing and printing services and even telephone and document-binding services. He has often provided support services to the Action Now Kenya office, as well as to many other companies in the area. <P>\r\n\r\nKennedy went to the Kenya School of Professional Studies where he took courses in IT (Information Technology) from 2001 to 2003. After his studies he got a job at a Video Library located at the Garden estate where he worked for two years. In the year 2005, he was employed at a hardware shop located at Donholm estate, East of Nairobi. He was inspired by his father to set up a cyber caf\u00e9, and with his father's assistance together with the little savings he had put aside, Kennedy set up the cyber caf\u00e9 in April 2006. This has helped him a great deal because it has uplifted his life since then, and unlike many youths of his age in Kenya, he does not have to depend on his parents for his personal expenses.<P>\r\n\r\nKennedy now wishes to expand his business in order to be able to do colour printing, which currently he is not able to do. He is therefore requesting a loan of US$ 250, which will enable him to purchase the colour printer. This will go a long way toward giving his clients quality services which will translate into higher income. Kennedy intends to repay the loan within 6 months."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":53942,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Computers","sector":"Services","use":"To purchase a colour printer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kenyatta Market, Nairobi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":36,"posted_date":"2007-08-14T21:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kennedy","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-08-29T04:06:48Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":250,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2007-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2007-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2007-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2008-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2008-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":41.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":41.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":42,"local_amount":42,"processed_date":"2007-10-23T09:17:59Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-23T10:04:50Z","rounded_local_amount":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":70985,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":42,"local_amount":42,"processed_date":"2007-11-23T10:21:23Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-23T10:04:50Z","rounded_local_amount":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":85553,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":42,"local_amount":42,"processed_date":"2007-12-23T10:17:53Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-23T10:04:50Z","rounded_local_amount":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":101555,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":42,"local_amount":42,"processed_date":"2008-01-23T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-23T10:04:50Z","rounded_local_amount":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":120497,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":42,"local_amount":42,"processed_date":"2008-02-23T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-23T10:04:50Z","rounded_local_amount":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":140648,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":40,"local_amount":40,"processed_date":"2008-03-23T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-23T10:04:50Z","rounded_local_amount":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":164262,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2007-08-15T04:06:48Z","paid_date":"2008-03-23T10:04:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":8,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":16056,"name":"Morn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Morn H. is 53 years old and lives in Kampong Cham Province with her husband and their five children.

Wainaina can be described as a very hardworking man.

This business was operational from 1998 to 2002. Apart from his business, N. is also a community worker within Kayole where he resides. He runs a small community based organization by the name of AIDS Link, and he is sometimes hired by NGOs and social work groups to assist in matters affecting his community. <P>\r\n\r\nThrough his hard work, and from the payments he received from the transport company, N. managed to save up Ksh 95,000 (US$ 1440), which he used to start off his kerosene-selling business. He has undergone several business management training courses and has gained a lot of experience, both from the dry cleaning business that he used to run and also from the kerosene business that he is currently operating. <P>\r\n\r\nN. wishes to expand his business. His vision for the business is to become able to sell on a wholesale scale in his area. His only difficulty is finances necessary to stock more kerosene, which is the main fuel used for cooking within his community. He is requesting a loan of US$ 800, which will be repayable within 12 months. The loan will enable him to expand his kerosene business and attract more customers, since he will have enough kerosene to meet the needs within his community. This will also enable him to make his prices more reasonable, a great advantage to his customers. The additional stock will also require him to employ 2-3 people from his community, to assist him in serving the customers. The additional loan will enable him to increase his income, hence improve his family\u2019s

Julius lives at Mlolongo, an informal settlement along the Nairobi \u2013 Mombassa highway. Apart from caring for his young family, Julius has the burden of taking care of his brothers and sisters after losing both of his parents.<P>\r\n\t\r\nJulius started his restaurant business in the year 2006. This was after he and the other employees he worked with were sent home after the chain of supermarkets they were working for came under receivership. Since Julius had experience in dealing with customers while at the Uchumi supermarket, his former workplace, he decided not to waste his skills. He therefore ventured into the restaurant industry, where he felt that he could make use of his skills while at the same time earning some money for the upkeep of his family and siblings.  <P>\r\n\t\r\nIn order to finance the start-up of his business, Julius sold one of his cows for a total of Ksh 18,000 (US$ 300) and put this amount in, together with his personal savings of Ksh 40,000.00 (US$ 670), which he had put aside while still in employment. With this, he opened his business in the year 2006. The business has since been doing very well, and Julius now feels that he wants to improve the business by adding on some kitchen equipment. This will include a cooker, a refrigerator, a French fries warmer, a juice extractor, a blender, and some cooking fat. These will enable him to give his clients quicker and better service. <P>The population within the Mololongo area is rapidly growing and Julius wants his business to grow with the rising number of potential customers. For this reason he is kindly requesting a loan of US$ 1000 so that he can fully equip his restaurant. <P>Given this loan, Julius feels that he will be able to give his customers the very best service. He will also be able to employ 2 young men to assist  him in running the business, thereby benefiting the community by creating employment. The repayment period for this loan will be 8 months."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":53954,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase of restaurant kitchen equipment","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Mlolongo settlement","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":36,"posted_date":"2007-08-14T21:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julius","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-08-29T12:22:31Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2007-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2007-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2007-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2008-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2008-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2008-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2008-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":125}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":125,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2007-10-24T09:18:12Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-24T09:02:40Z","rounded_local_amount":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":71315,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":125,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2007-11-24T10:19:41Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-24T09:02:40Z","rounded_local_amount":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":85940,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":125,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2007-12-24T10:17:48Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-24T09:02:40Z","rounded_local_amount":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":101975,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":125,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2008-01-24T10:15:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-24T09:02:40Z","rounded_local_amount":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":120946,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":125,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2008-02-24T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-24T09:02:40Z","rounded_local_amount":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":141206,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":125,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2008-03-24T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-24T09:02:40Z","rounded_local_amount":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":164922,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":125,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2008-04-24T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-24T09:02:40Z","rounded_local_amount":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":190581,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":125,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2008-05-24T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-24T09:02:40Z","rounded_local_amount":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":218095,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2007-08-15T12:22:31Z","paid_date":"2008-05-24T09:02:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":7,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":16061,"name":"Yous","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Yous N. is a 48 year old widow living in Kampong Cham Province with her two children.

N. Kariuki is a 42-year-old man, married with two children. He lives in Kitengela town in Athi River, in the Eastern Province of Kenya. Jonah started singing while in school. His music teacher noticed his musical talent and nurtured him to the point where he became a seasoned singer by the time he was through with his music lessons.<P>\r\n\r\nAfter school Jonah married Bilha Njeri who also is a gospel singer. Together, in the year 1995, they released their first album by the name of \u201c Ngai oiga ni oiga\u201d meaning \u201cif God says he has said it\u201d, which consists of 12 songs. This album sold like hotcakes and with the proceeds Jonah was able to rent a shop in Kitengela and buy a generator which up to now he uses to preach the word of God and advertise his cassettes. <P>\r\n\r\nJonah has a soft heart for children and has started a children\u2019s home in Ruai town, on the outskirts of Nairobi. The children\u2019s home, Fire Ministry Children\u2019s Home, takes care of 45 orphans. Apart from the orphans at the children\u2019s home, Jonah takes care of his sister and her 2 children because she is sick and unable to take care of them. He also takes care of the 5 orphaned children of his sister-in-law who died of HIV\/AIDS in the year 2000.<P>\r\n\r\nWell aware of advances in music production used to recorded on CDs and DVDs, Jonah wants to go HI-TECH with his music. Therefore he is requesting a loan of US$1200. Given this loan, he will purchase a keyboard, amplifier, two speakers, and a microphone. With this equipment, he will be in a better position to produce music on CDs and DVDS and through this, he will earn more income. This will enable him to spread the gospel and provide for his very big family. The repayment period for the loan will be 8 months."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":53957,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Musical Performance","sector":"Entertainment","use":"Purchase of a keyboard, amplifier, etc. to use to produce gospel recordings","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitengela, Athi River","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":36,"posted_date":"2007-08-27T00:45:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jonah","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-09-10T13:40:05Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2007-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2007-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2008-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2008-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2008-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2008-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2008-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":150}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2007-10-21T09:18:36Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-21T09:03:18Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":70273,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2007-11-21T10:19:10Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-21T09:03:18Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":84581,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2007-12-21T10:17:50Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-21T09:03:18Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":100579,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2008-01-21T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-21T09:03:18Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":119377,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2008-02-21T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-21T09:03:18Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":139460,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2008-03-21T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-21T09:03:18Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":162558,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2008-04-21T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-21T09:03:18Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":187816,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2008-05-21T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-21T09:03:18Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":215907,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2007-08-27T13:40:05Z","paid_date":"2008-05-21T09:03:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":6,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":16063,"name":"Hong","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Hong K. is 35 years old and lives in Kampong Cham Province with her husband and their five children.

Obviously, this affected Cruz.  She had to make monthly payments to her sister in order to repay for the capital she put up. Instead of having two people invest in the business, Cruz found herself alone and limited by the payments. She used a loan from Kiva and Mifex to help her get past the tough times and this resulted in a great deal of help for her. <\/p>\r\n<p>Cruz is now seeking this loan in order to invest in completely new products now that she is finished paying her sister. She is confident in her ability to sell and assures lenders that there is sufficient demand to justify an investment.
