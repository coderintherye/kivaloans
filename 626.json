He lives in his own home located in the town of Canayre in the Llochegua district.  \r\n\r\nSince his youth, Yhony wanted to have a large store, but that was not his parents raised him.  In a more responsible and effective manner, he later began to farm, specifically producing and selling cacao.  Currently, he produces a considerable amount, and his potential buyers feel satisfied by the good production he has.  Therefore, he wants to improve the quality of his products by using new grafting techniques on his cacao crop and then selling it at a competitive price.

The group is made up of the following ladies: Teresa de Jesus; Margarita; Demetria Cristina who will use her loan to buy perfumes, deodorants, creams, etc; Se\u00f1ora Luisa who will buy fabrics and sewing thread; Se\u00f1ora Gabriela Joaquina who will buy gelatin and cups; Se\u00f1ora Maria de Jesus who will buy Tupperware at wholesale; Se\u00f1ora Maria Elena who is going to buy shoes at wholesale; Se\u00f1ora Elizabeth who will buy pork and honey to sell pork scratchings; Se\u00f1or Salvador Wilbert who will buy goats and food to raise and sell them; Se\u00f1ora Estela who is going to buy blankets and sheets. \r\n\r\nSe\u00f1ora Gabriela Joaquina is 46 years old and is married.  Her husband works in the fields and she has a son named Wilbert who is 26.  She sells jellies in Jaloxtoc, which is about 10 minutes from Tlayecac.  She uses public transport to reach the village where she sells the jellies, her sister helps her sell them.  She uses a carrying case for the jellies because she has had surgery and cannot carry anything heavy. She is applying for the loan to buy raw materials and ingredients to produce the jellies; she will buy essences, cups, milk, a carrying case and a tricycle.  She started her business 17 years ago to meet her financial needs and her son was young.  Her uncle taught her how to make the jellies and her husband gave money to buy the raw ingredients.  She started little by little and has grown and sold more jellies, she is well-known by her customers for her good taste. \r\n\r\nHer business is important because she likes to make jellies and go out to sell them, and above all, it has helped defray the family expenses.  She is proud of having her own business, and to be able to provide education for her child.  Her business faces the challenges of high costs and hot weather.  In hot weather, she has to make the sales more hastily because of the risk of the jellies melting.  She applies part of her profits for food, part for reinvesting in the ingredients, and part for electricity and gas.  Her hopes and dreams are to grow her business, so that the whole family can be in good health and she can put a roofing slab on her home.  She is very happy that this loan will help her to buy the raw materials to keep on selling jellies. \r\n\r\nThe group members want to tell Kiva and Fundacion Realidad  that \"the ladies thank you for your loans, and thank you for caring for people with low incomes so that we can meet our needs and grow our businesses.\" \r\n\r\nTlayecac is a pretty village.  There are fields where sorghum and corn are grown, there are hills, and one can raise animals for sale like goats, sheep, and cows. \r\n\r\nSe\u00f1ora Teresa de Jesus is missing from the picture."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2650,"image":{"id":804863,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy gelatin, essences, cups, milk, carrying case and tricycle for making and selling jellies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"TLAYECAC MORELOS","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-07-08T16:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gabriela Joaquina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teresa De Jesus","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria De Jesus","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margarita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Salvador Wilbert","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Estela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Demetria Cristina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":31000,"loan_amount":2650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3875},{"due_date":"2011-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":3875},{"due_date":"2011-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3875},{"due_date":"2011-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":3875},{"due_date":"2011-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":3875},{"due_date":"2011-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":3875},{"due_date":"2011-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":3875},{"due_date":"2011-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3875}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":331.25},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":331.25},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":331.25},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":331.25},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":331.25},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":331.25},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":331.25},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":331.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":662.5,"local_amount":7750,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-19T07:48:08Z","rounded_local_amount":7788.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":222223491,"comment":null},{"amount":662.5,"local_amount":7750,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-16T08:10:44Z","rounded_local_amount":7788.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227201769,"comment":null},{"amount":662.5,"local_amount":7750,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:12:29Z","rounded_local_amount":7788.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232807359,"comment":null},{"amount":662.5,"local_amount":7750,"processed_date":"2011-10-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:22:12Z","rounded_local_amount":7788.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238618465,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-07-09T00:54:35Z","paid_date":"2011-11-15T10:22:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":313598,"name":"Mu\u00b4ssha Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Aurelia es originaria de la localidad de Francisco Serrato ubicado en el estado de Michoac\u00e1n,  una localidad rica en pinos y con una hermosa vista a sus bosques, ah\u00ed predomina el lenguaje y la vestimenta mazahua.

She makes her living making artisanal crafts from ocoshal [pine needles]. She makes things like bread boxes, tortilla holders, fruit baskets, earrings, egg baskets, vases, flower baskets, etc. She has been at this for approximately five years. She says that she started to do this work to help her husband with the household costs because he can no longer work due to the fact that he has a hernia. They both work in their home making crafts and caring for their children.\r\n\r\nShe says that she sells her crafts in Ciudad Hidalgo, Michoac\u00e1n; Tuxpan, Michoac\u00e1n; and Toluca, Estado de M\u00e9xico. Do\u00f1a Juana is requesting a loan for the purchase of ocoshal, needles, thread, bleach and detergent to wash the ocoshal. Se\u00f1ora Juana is married to Se\u00f1or Tomas who is an artisan and farmworker. They have nine children but just seven of them live with them. Miguel is 16 years old and he no longer studies as he now helps his parents with the household costs and his younger siblings\u2019 education. Then there is Alma who is 11 years old, Rafael who is 9 years old and 7-year-old Eduardo, all of whom are primary school students. Finally, Tomas is 5 years old and Cristal is 4 years old.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Juana says that unfortunately she cannot go to cities that are far away to sell her crafts because she sells them at a low price making it unprofitable. She does not have enough money for the expense. This is one of the issues she has in the business. She says that the loan will help them a lot as they will buy more supplies to make the crafts.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are Gregorio, Maria Crisanta and Efr\u00e9n. They are requesting loans to invest in the building of a concrete partition and supplies for avocado cultivation\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1450,"image":{"id":804906,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":"to make pieces from ocoshal [pine needles].

She is married to Elpidio, a taxi driver, and mother to their child. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to save for her child's future. \r\n\r\nJosefa operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which sells groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, five peso's worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Josefa makes money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting an 8,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nJosefa hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she hopes to save money for the future.

At this time, she is working hard to save for the future of her child.\r\n\r\nFlora operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Flora earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 9,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nFlora hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she hopes to save money for the future. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":805090,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to pay for grocery products and inventory items needed in her variety store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Tanza, Cavite","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-07-05T15:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Flora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":9000,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2011-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2011-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2011-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2011-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2011-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2011-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2011-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2011-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2011-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2011-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2011-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2011-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2011-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2011-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2011-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2011-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2011-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2011-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2011-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2011-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2011-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":375}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.38},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.37},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.38},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.37},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.38},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.37},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.38},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.37},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.38},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.37},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.38},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.37},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.38},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":9.37},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":9.38},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":9.37},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":9.38},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":9.37},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":9.38},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":9.37},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":9.38},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":9.37},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":9.38},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":9.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:31:52Z","rounded_local_amount":1626.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221636987,"comment":null},{"amount":46.88,"local_amount":1875,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:40:44Z","rounded_local_amount":2033.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227005297,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:35:21Z","rounded_local_amount":1626.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232764465,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:37:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1626.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238571589,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:31:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1626.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244529170,"comment":null},{"amount":28.12,"local_amount":1125,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:39:12Z","rounded_local_amount":1219.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250738422,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-07-08T11:20:36Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T09:39:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":313632,"name":"Loise","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Loise is a 34 year old hard working business lady.

Being single, she manages her own household while operating her business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nNimfa operates a junk shop. Trash is not actively segregated in the Philippines and, while waiting for their local dump trucks, people scavenge garbage dumps and trash bags for recyclable materials like metal, copper, plastic, paper and other materials. They sell these items to junk shops like Nimfa\u2019s for a little profit. Junk shops then stack, clean, and gather huge quantities of these materials and sell them back to foundries, like factories, and others of the like. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 8,000 loan. She will be incorporating the loan into her current revolving fund, used to buy trash from collectors and for the maintenance of her motorcycle cart. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nNimfa dreams to have a much bigger place for her business. She also hopes to have her motorcycle paid soon. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":805093,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Recycling","sector":"Services","use":"to pay for scrap materials that she buys for her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Tanza, Cavite","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-07-05T15:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nimfa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":533.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":53.33,"local_amount":2133.32,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:31:56Z","rounded_local_amount":2313.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221636988,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2666.65,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:40:49Z","rounded_local_amount":2891.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227005298,"comment":null},{"amount":53.33,"local_amount":2133.03,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:35:26Z","rounded_local_amount":2313.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232764466,"comment":null},{"amount":26.67,"local_amount":1067,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:37:22Z","rounded_local_amount":1157.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238571590,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-07-05T23:21:45Z","paid_date":"2011-11-15T09:37:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":313634,"name":"Beatrice","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Beatrice has been selling vegetables and charcoal for the last four years.

and his wife, Melinda, started their League City, Texas-based business, Publish-ME.com, LLC, after they realized their hobby of publishing free software online had the potential to earn them a profit. Two and a half years ago, Stephen decided to turn his long-time website, which offered free and safe software downloads, into a business by opening up advertising space on it. This was the official start of their business because, as Stephen says, \u201cFrom day one, it was instantly profitable.\u201d \r\n\r\nStephen and Melinda\u2019s website, www.safefreesoftware.com, offers their clients eight categories of virus-free software downloads: security, games, video, audio, apps, internet, business and website development. In total, they offer 6,727 programs, which means that a visitor to their site is bound to find something that fits their needs. The high traffic resulting from this diversity of reliable content has contributed to the success of the advertising space offered on the website.\r\n\r\nDespite their impressive initial success, Stephen and Melinda are very excited to continue growing their business. Along with continuing to offer reliable software downloads, they are now adding another component to the site that will keep customers informed about the world of software development. Under Melinda\u2019s guidance, the site now has an \u201ceditorial\u201d page, which will teach the reader about a certain kind of software each day. With this in mind, the website now boasts that returning customers can \u201clearn something new every day!\u201d\r\n\r\nThis loan made the new editorial section of the website possible. The remainder of the funds are going to the development of advertising space on other sites to draw in more customers. Stephen says that, though the new developments on the site allow it more traffic from search engines, the daily budget still runs primarily on ads that he and Melinda put on other sites. \r\n\r\nThe biggest business successes that publish-ME.com, LLC has seen, according to Stephen and Melinda, are its instant and continued profitability and that is has allowed Melinda to devote herself 100% to her own business. While Stephen still manages another full-time career, Melinda develops the business and writes its content full time. Without this loan, Stephen says that the business would have taken much longer to get to the point that it\u2019s at now; with it, Stephen and Melinda are able to continue expanding their business and providing reliable services to their loyal clientele.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":9225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1395.2,"image":{"id":804749,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Computers","sector":"Services","use":"to

McAllen, Texas-based sporting accessory business, The Commander, grew slowly out of her and her husband\u2019s dream of becoming self-sufficient entrepreneurs. Starting their careers as waiters, Marcela and her husband, Juan, began chasing their dream by selling sporting clothing and accessories at weekend flea markets. Recently, they made the largest business decision since they began pursuing their business goal: they moved to a permanent, fixed location.\r\n\r\nTen years ago, with strong encouragement from Juan, Marcela began selling military and hunting items at two McAllen flea markets. As the years passed, she began to envision a permanent location for her business, and she and Juan began to look at buildings with dimensions appropriate for their inventory. Six months ago, they found an affordable, central location and took a courageous leap of faith by signing a lease and moving their inventory.\r\n\r\nAt first, Marcela says, business seemed to flow smoothly enough; however, she soon started to see that her store needed more inventory. Customers demanded varied items that Marcela had never sold before, such as paintball gear and police suits. As she realized that her flea market inventory was not sufficient to fill the needs of the business\u2019 permanent location, she began to search for ways to meet the demands of her new customers.\r\n\r\nThis loan was the solution to Marcela\u2019s inventory problem. It was invested in new inventory, such as paintball products and police attire, to fill the unique demands of her new customers. After being denied a loan from a commercial bank, she came to Kiva partner, Accion Texas-Louisiana. Of this experience, she says \u201cThe loan helped our business a lot. Without it, with our lack of new inventory, I project that our business would have closed down in a short time.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Commander now supplies its customers with the sporting items they need. Some additions to her inventory include flashlights, caps, hats, bandanas, camouflage face paint, helmets, paintballs, facemasks, paintball guns, and boots. Marcela says that her business is successful in part because it offers more variety to her customers than her competitors. Without her loan, she says, none of this success would have been possible.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Marcela aims to continue her business\u2019 success and growth by providing her customers with their sporting needs. She will continue running her business with the support and hard work of her husband and three daughters. Most of all, with the help of her new loan, she hopes to continue realizing her long-time dream of being a self-sufficient entrepreneur.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":9050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1707.36,"image":{"id":803787,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sporting Good

A. Monuments, is a uniquely community-oriented company. Virgilio prides himself in serving seniors in his Hispanic community by offering them reasonably priced, high quality products. His aim, he says, is to help these seniors provide respectable, well-crafted monuments for their loved ones that fit into their small and often fixed-income budgets.\r\n\r\nVirgilio\u2019s business, which he began 15 years ago, makes stone memorial monuments for cemeteries. The ideas to start his business came to him while working at a funeral home, during which time he started to create monuments for the customers there. When people began to comment on how much they liked his work and asked for more of his products, Virgilio opened the doors to D. A. Monuments.\r\n\r\nCurrently, he sells his products directly to members of the Hispanic community and has contracts with various cemeteries in his area. The business has grown enough in the past 15 years to support two full-time employees and two others who are on-call. However, even with these employees, the amount of sketching, measuring, and designing necessary to fill his monument orders was causing Virgilio to work ten to twelve hour days, including weekends. As a result, he decided to modernize his business, utilizing cutting-edge computer design equipment to save time and allow his business to take on more orders.\r\n\r\nVirgilio used his loan to purchase a computer system called Monu-Cad, worth $15,000, which allows him to map out the design of his products on the computer. It dramatically cuts down on the amount of work he has to do; he says what used to take 24 hours can now be done in an hour and a half. His is the only business that offers that type of quick service in his town, and he is now able to produce and sell significantly more products.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Virgilio hopes to continue offering the affordable, reliable products for his community members along with gaining more large contracts with cemeteries. Since his loan freed up a lot of time that would otherwise be spent hand-designing his products, he believes that he can now truly begin growing into larger markets. \r\n\r\nHis 15 years in business has led Virgilio to offer the following advice on frugality and fiscal responsibility to aspiring business-owners: \u201cYou can\u2019t live a luxurious life because your business will claim it; you have to be cautious with your expenditures.\u201d With this knowledge and his newly modernized workplace, Virgilio hopes to continue serving the monument needs of his customers and his community.

They have three daughters who live with them in the own home in a central area of the city of Tarma, where most of the residents work in Lima because of the better economic opportunities.  Her love is cooking because it provides her with a distraction and a means of generating an income to cover household expenses.  Queta started her food business by setting aside a space in her house and equipping it as a diner, but now it is a restaurant.  She has been in business for approximately five years and attends to her customers every day during the lunch hour.  Each plate of food sells for 5 PEN and on Sundays the price is 7 PEN.  Even though her business is one of the more expensive restaurants in the area, the exquisite taste of her food justifies the price.  Queta says that she enjoys cooking and seeing her customers enjoy their food.  However, she dislikes the delays caused by having to buy supplies for each preparation because she is very selective with her purchases.  For this reason, she buys everything she needs for the entire week except vegetables.  Queta is very happy that her husband is a college instructor at the Santa Lucia Educational Center where he teaches courses in accounting, economics, and management.  Within time, she wants to expand her business by adding other products such as pastries and candy.  \r\n<p>\r\nQueta is a member of the Communal Bank \u201cTaruma\u201d and receiving her tenth loan with MFP.  She hopes to work together with the other members so that they can follow through with their plans.  Once again, she promises to complete her payments just like she did with her previous loans.  Queta appreciates being part of her Communal Bank because all of the members are responsible and supportive people.

This is his third loan from MFP and he is very grateful for it and hopes to be able to make all his repayments on time.

Their house floor is just bare ground.  Their children are little and it is affecting their health.  Edis Manuel approached Ceprodel's office to request a loan so that he could buy sheets of corrugated metal, beams, cement and sand in order to make this improvement which will provide him with a decent home and a better quality of life for his children and his wife.\n\nTranslated from Spanish: \n\nEn la ciudad de Masaya, reside don  Edis Manuel, quien labora para la instituci\u00f3n de Enacal desde hace nueve a\u00f1os en mantanimiento de la tuberia de agua potable , es casado con tres hijos menores.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

","en":"Maria Concepcion is 43 years old.  She is a single mother and has three daughters and one son.  She lives in the San Nicolas village and is a member and coordinator of the Senda de Amor (Path of Love) Community Bank.  Mrs. Maria started by selling nacatamales and used clothing, and for the past few years works making and selling rosquillas and quesadillas.  She gets up very early in the morning to start her day's work.  Two of her daughters help her mix the ingredients while she prepares the oven.  Once the products are done baking, one of her daughters helps her deliver them.  Through the sales of her products she is able to make a good living, but when it rains a lot she is not as successful because the firewood gets wet and the bread does not bake well and then gets overbaked.  She learned this business by watching others do it and they also helped her practice.  She needs this loan to buy supplies like flour, sugar, eggs, soda, firewood, etc.  With the products she sells she will continue to support her family and also save a little for any emergency that may come up.  She dreams of supporting her daughters so that each one has her own business and can earn an honest living.  \r\n<p>\r\nFAMA currently provides its clients with courses in baking and pastries and Mrs. Maria and her other group members have learned from these courses.  For this reason she will introduce more products to her business, such as cakes and other types of bread.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1525,"image":{"id":806317,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","use":"buy flour, sugar, eggs, firewood, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Juticalpa, Olancho","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":168,"posted_date":"2011-07-10T02:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Concepcion ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa Danubia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irma Eloidina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lidia Esperanza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edy Isolina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martha Cristina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aura Noe ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paula Josefa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ramon Abel ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":28500,"loan_amount":1525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":7125},{"due_date":"2011-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":7125},{"due_date":"2011-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":7125},{"due_date":"2011-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":7125}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":381.25},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":381.25},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":381.25},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":381.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":381.25,"local_amount":7125,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:43:49Z","rounded_local_amount":7203.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221657982,"comment":null},{"amount":381.25,"local_amount":7125,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T07:57:56Z","rounded_local_amount":7203.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227307937,"comment":null},{"amount":381.25,"local_amount":7125,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:51:45Z","rounded_local_amount":7203.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232784918,"comment":null},{"amount":381.25,"local_amount":7125,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:53:45Z","rounded_local_amount":7203.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238589313,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-07-10T20:25:40Z","paid_date":"2011-11-15T09:53:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":314039,"name":"Carmentina Lili","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Carmentina lives in the town of Danli in southern Honduras where she has made a living for the last 18 years by selling clothing and women\u2019s cosmetics.

She currently lives with the youngest of her three children (a daughter).  \r\n\r\nLife was very hard for Martina who faced financial hardship after she migrated to the city.  She set herself up in business with just a little capital.  She sold a range of products according to the occasion or the season.  In winter, Martina sells blankets and also bedspreads depending on what her customers request.  She also crochets items.  In parallel with this, she also sells sheep in a livestock market, as well as their meat, depending on her customer demand.  Over the years, Martina gained experience and saw the profitability of these business activities.

She lives with her husband and their three children in the Cofradia neighborhood.  She is a very tenacious person.  When she was very young she started earning a living by working arduously.  For ten years she has been selling all types of groceries in a small grocery store she has in part of her house.  She tends the store from 6:00 a.m. until 8:00 p.m.  Her greatest advantage is that she does not have competition.  However, she has few customers because she lives in the outskirts of the city.\r\n\r\nWith the requested loan she will be able to stock her business with more groceries and varied products.  That way her business will continue to stay afloat.  One day she will be able to fulfill her dream of getting a house.  The most important thing is to continue supporting her children\u2019s education.\r\n\r\nHer colleague in the group, Dulce Patricia, sells second hand clothes.

He is a man who has always struggled to get ahead in life. He lives alone in his own house, and what he desires the most is to have a peaceful retirement. Through the years, Artemio has learnt that he needs to work very hard if he wants his crops to be the best of his village; and so, with great effort he has succeeded in becoming a leader in the production of potatoes, peas, spinach and carrots. Every one of his crops is highly requested in the markets of the town of Tarma, which is where he gets the best incomes. He has been engaged in this activity for 45 years. What he likes the most about his job is harvesting his products, and he thinks the most difficult part is keeping his lands free form the weeds that constantly grow in his crops. He also says that in his free time he works as a farmhand in other farm lands, as well as by transporting products from the countryside to the city using donkeys, which is known as \"aseminas\". He is now getting ready to harvest his next \u201cAndina\u201d potato crop, which will be ripen by next week.
