Most of these customers are monthly income earners who take delivery and make payments at the end of the month. During the rest of the time she would be waiting without doing anything. Even if there were more customers to be supplied, she would not have the stock at hand, so she says she needs to really increase her stock to meet the needs of all her customers.\r\n<br><br>\r\nShe therefore seeks a loan of 250,000 Uganda shillings (US$150) to enable her to meet this high demand.

Life was hard, and she had to get a job at age 15 in a shoe factory where she worked for 5 years.  Her family moved, and because the new house was far from the factory, Lili had to look for work closer to home.  \r\n<p> She became pregnant at age 18 and stopped working.  Life became more difficult all the time since the father of her child was older and had a wife.  Lili had to look for another job in a tailor shop where she worked as a seamstress for a few years.  Later, she got together with a Portuguese man who wanted her to go to Portugal with him.  Out of fear, she refused to go.  After that, she met another man with whom she had 4 children and they still live together to this day.  \r\n\r\n<p>The tailor shop closed and she decided to open her own business by going to South Africa to buy clothes and selling in Mozambique.  After facing some difficulties, LIli decided to move the business and she traveled northern Mozambique buying cows, goats, and cereals to resell in Maputo.  Since this business was so demanding and risky, she quit and traveled to Inhambane where she bought fish and chickens to resell in the capital city.  Some time later, one of her daughters taught her to raise broiler chickens, which she continues to do.\r\n\r\n<p>With the loan, she will buy chicks and feed which will improve her business.

Los productos que comercializa son la mayor\u00eda de su producci\u00f3n, y cuando es necesario compra de sus vecinos.\r\nCabe destacar que es un trabajo muy sacrificado, pues vienen en grupo y se quedan a dormir dos noches en sus puestos de trabajos, y ella a pesar de su edad lo hace siempre con mucho entusiasmo.\r\nEl pr\u00e9stamo solicitado es para la ampliaci\u00f3n de la infraestructura que posee para la cr\u00eda de cerdos. Siendo este actualmente el producto que mayor demanda tienen en la feria y si compra de terceros su ganancia es menor que si los produce ella misma por lo que desea construir un galp\u00f3n de 2 x 2 metros para criar 4 cerdos m\u00e1s."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":49506,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To build an extra pig sty\/construcci\u00f3n de un galp\u00f3n para cr\u00eda de cerdos","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PY","country":"Paraguay","town":"Encarnaci\u00f3n","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-22.993333 -57.996389","type":"point"}},"partner_id":58,"posted_date":"2007-07-18T21:15:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Saturnina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-08-01T22:19:33Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":150,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2007-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2007-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2007-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2008-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2008-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2008-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2008-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2008-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2008-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":15,"local_amount":15,"processed_date":"2007-08-19T09:18:19Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-19T09:07:09Z","rounded_local_amount":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44448,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":15,"local_amount":15,"processed_date":"2007-09-19T09:19:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-19T09:07:09Z","rounded_local_amount":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":56473,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":15,"local_amount":15,"processed_date":"2007-10-19T09:26:15Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-19T09:07:09Z","rounded_local_amount":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":69556,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":15,"local_amount":15,"processed_date":"2007-11-19T10:30:20Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-19T09:07:09Z","rounded_local_amount":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":83748,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":15,"local_amount":15,"processed_date":"2007-12-19T10:31:06Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-19T09:07:09Z","rounded_local_amount":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":99508,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":15,"local_amount":15,"processed_date":"2008-01-19T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-19T09:07:09Z","rounded_local_amount":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118228,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":15,"local_amount":15,"processed_date":"2008-02-19T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-19T09:07:09Z","rounded_local_amount":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":138319,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":15,"local_amount":15,"processed_date":"2008-03-19T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-19T09:07:09Z","rounded_local_amount":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":161325,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":15,"local_amount":15,"processed_date":"2008-04-19T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-19T09:07:09Z","rounded_local_amount":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":186392,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":15,"local_amount":15,"processed_date":"2008-05-19T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-19T09:07:09Z","rounded_local_amount":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":214320,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2007-07-18T22:19:33Z","paid_date":"2008-05-19T09:07:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":14311,"name":"Anibal","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"An\u00edbal is 45 years old and is married to Celsa.

She opened her own business from home selling women\u2019s clothing such as underwear, socks, sportswear etc.  her good location and the fact that she has been doing this for 10 years means she has many clients.

She would like to enlarge her business and for this she would like a loan to buy larger quantities of underwear and socks as you get a better price and more discounts for buying them in bulk which means she could compete more in the market and at the same time increase her sales and therefore her earnings.\r\n\r\n<p> <b> Translated from Spanish by Liz Harvey, Kiva Volunteer <\/b> <p>\r\n\r\nLeoncia R.

Their four children are grown up; each has his own family.  Unlike a lot of women at this age, Mrs. S. believes that working helps people stay healthier.  Her main job now is to take care of her chickens.  Her chicken-house is divided into three parts:  chickens raised for meat, for eggs, and for breeding.  Having a systematic and scientific farming categorization, Mrs. S. is confident at investing on Egyptain high-yield chickens.  This is a bold decision because this is a new breed in Vietnam.  Most of the villagers are still afraid of investing on this breed because they do not know if it will work.  With determination, S. believes in the success of the project.  She plans to borrow $450 to buy food for her more- than- 100 chickens. \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Vietnamese by Phuong Nguyen, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\u1ede tu\u1ed5i 56, ch\u1ecb \u0110\u00e0o Th\u1ecb S. v\u00e0 ch\u1ed3ng ch\u1ecb, anh Nguy\u1ec5n Ng\u1ecdc Ng\u00f4n, 60 tu\u1ed5i c\u00f3 th\u1ec3 y\u00ean t\u00e2m ngh\u1ec9 ng\u01a1i v\u00e0 vui v\u1ebb v\u1edbi vi\u1ec7c tr\u00f4ng ch\u00e1u. 4 ng\u01b0\u1eddi con c\u1ee7a anh ch\u1ecb \u0111\u1ec1u \u0111\u00e3 tr\u01b0\u1edfng th\u00e0nh v\u00e0 c\u00f3 gia \u0111\u00ecnh ri\u00eang.

She comes from Gulu district in the northern part of Uganda. Currently she is living in one of the residential areas located in Kampala known as Nakawa Quarters. She is 30 years old, and she currently is totally responsible for her children without any assistance.\r\n<br><br>\r\nHelen left Gulu because she felt the North was unsafe due to the war, and she also needed to search for some kind of work so that her family could survive. It was not easy finding work in Kampala, so Helen started a small business. She would cook food and then take it to busy places and sell it. That was how she found Life in Africa: she came to us to sell her meals. She soon became a member and is now employed in the bracelet-making project. She has proved herself to be an understanding and patient person with great interpersonal skills.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nHelen is very active and committed to the activities that LIA offers at our center. Over time, through Helen\u2019s job at LIA, she was able to save some money that enabled her to start a small charcoal business in her effort to set up a side income to sustain herself and her family. She has proved to have a good head for business and has developed a solid customer base. She now plans to expand this business. <P>Currently Helen\u2019s charcoal stall is located in her residential area and it\u2019s being managed by one of her family members. They share the stall, each selling their own goods, and they take turns at working the stall.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nHelen has now entered into a partnership with another dealer to travel up-country to buy charcoal at a lower price. They will split the transport costs which will allow each to make a greater profit.\r\nShe has managed to save 150,000 Uganda shillings (US$ 90) and she is requesting a loan in the amount of 200,000 Uganda shillings to finance the expansion.

She tries to meet their needs with the little that she has, so that they may be happy.\r\n<p>\r\nA hard-working, devoted, and honest woman, she had benefited from an initial loan that she was able to repay in the shortest time.  Today, wishing to enlarge her field, she is requesting once again a loan of $600.  This loan will allow her to produce a great profit in order to send her children to school and to improve her family's living conditions.  \r\n<p> <b>Translated from French by Daniel Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\r\nAg\u00e9e de 36 ans, Madame N.

Cesar is 45 years old. He is married and lives in a small house with his wife and two children, the oldest is 10 and the youngest 7. His children attend school, and Cesar is proud of them for enjoying it.  He hopes that his children can continue studying, especially since he did not have this opportunity. <p> Cesar produces and sells milk. For 15 years, he has owned cows. At this time, he raises four with the help of his wife. Previously, he worked in Argentina as a construction worker, and after several years of saving he managed to return home. At first, he purchased 2 dairy cows, but once business began to grow, due largely to production, he purchased two more cows. <p>Right now, Cesar owns four cows, and business is doing well. He supplies various businesses in the city. About a month ago he started working as a supplier to an important business that demands a large amount of milk every day.

in 1966, Mr. S\u00e9dalo A. is married and father of five children. He makes his living farming and raising animals. Where he lives, raising pigs is very profitable since pork is much in demand. It is this animal husbandry that provides Mr. A.'s family's living. Until now, he has been engaging in traditional methods, that is, allowing his pigs free range although some of them run away. He would like to modernize his undertaking by constructing a fenced enclosure and also purchase additional pigs. For that reason, he is asking for a loan of $1000. The success of this endeavor will bring him a considerable increase in income, likely to improve the living conditions for his whole family. <P> <B> Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva volunteer <P> <\/b>N\u00e9 en 1966, Monsieur A.

Or, toute sa vie et celle de sa famille en d\u00e9pendent. Pour donner de bons rendements, ces terres ont besoin de fertilisants. C'est pourquoi Monsieur A. Ablam, vu le niveau actuel de ses plants de ma\u00efs, sollicite un cr\u00e9dit de $1000 pour acheter de l'engrais et des produits phytosanitaires qui lui permettront de traiter ces plants contre des insectes d\u00e9vastateurs. La r\u00e9ussite de la saison lui permettra de faire une bonne moisson. La vente des vivres lui permettra de subvenir aux besoins de sa famille et de mieux vivre."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":49713,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy

And so as a natural businessman he started to save some money to start his own business.\r\n<p>\r\nWith the limited but valuable money that he was able to save through much sacrifice, he took the first step and bought his first goods to sell.  He was then able to become independent by renting a stall in the local market, almost right next to where he used to work, where he now sells embroidered bedspreads, blankets, local clothing and hammocks.\r\n<p>\r\nHis business started to be profitable and he knew how to advantage of his success.  He expanded his store and started to take out loans that he paid back on time.\r\n<p>\r\nHaving passed a critical stage in his business and realizing that his business could not continue to grow where it was, he decided to close his store to look for new opportunities in order to increase his market.  He then began a style of business that is well known in his area, called \u2018macate\u2019 (traveling sales on credit from house to house) selling the same products that he sold in his previous business. He started to travel to other richer cities and was able to build a larger clientele so that his business now expands more every day.\r\n<p>\r\nThanks to his efforts he has already bought a motorcycle that he uses as a key element in his work.  V\u00edctor hopes to obtain a new loan with which he will buy more wholesale cotton thread in different colors to make bedspreads.

Two years ago she took out her first loan with Friendship Bridge and opened her stall in the Mazatenango market. Her business is called \"Bello Amanecer\", which means \"Beautiful Dawn\" in Spanish.

Her daughter helps her with the stand, which they keep open from eight in the morning until eight at night. She just finished paying off her second loan with Friendship Bridge. Her group of women, the \"Mujeres El Progreso\", paid their loan off with no late payments among the entire group, so part of the last payment was forgiven them as a bonus. Before starting up with the Friendship Bridge group, Maria had occasionally used bank loans, but they were far more expensive and became cost-prohibitive. \r\n<br\/><br\/>\r\nMaria works long hours and has been in good health, but recently she has been losing weight due to an unknown medical problem. \r\n<br\/><br\/>\r\nWith this loan she will buy more produce to serve the business.

T., 31, sells construction and firewood which seems unusual for a woman in Guatemala but yet her business is thriving. Her business \u201cVenta de Madera  Leonardo\u00a8 inamed after her youngest child is thriving. The demand for new construction wood in her small town is high and she sells all she can buy. When she receives a shipment it is all gone in two weeks.  Next to her home you can find her modest supply of wood post, construction lumber, 2x2 4x4, wood blanks as well as  fire wood. She started this business 5 years ago with the help of her father. She has used traditional banks in the past but they require a co-signer and charge higher rates. Accessing credit through Friendship Bridge is better for her because they do not require a co-signer or collateral and the lower rates means she has more money to reinvest in her business. She is in her 9th cycle of credit with Friendship Bridge, having been successful in repaying loans for more than four years, ever since the program started in her village. Etevina had her own home until her mother got sick and required hospitalization for just a couple of days before her death. Etelvina sold her home to help pay the hospital bill and moved in with her sister, where she and her two children currently live. She did buy a very small house recently but there is not enough room for her family. She will remodel the house so there is enough room for herself and her two children who are 8 and 10 when there is enough money to afford this project.  Etevina has a 6th grade education and values education as a priority in her life. She is very proud that her children have not missed any schooling due to her poverty. As a single parent she struggles to afford school for her children because of the cost of required uniforms, books, paper and pens. Her own dream is to go to nursing school which will cost about US$35 a month for two years. Meanwhile she still needs to provide for her family so she continues to grow her business so she can realize her dreams .

O. P., 45, supports herself by weaving huipiles, the traditional blouse worn by Mayan women. She will use the proceeds of this credit to buy more material. It can take a full month of full time work to make one huipil, and the material normally costs about 75 quetzals, or US$10, but she can sell the finished huipil for about 500 quetzales, or US$65.  She sells her work in the street, and also sells to tourists in a nearby town. She also sells small bags of a nut called \u201caba\u201d for 1 quetzal each (about US$0.08)  and helps in her sister\u2019s  tortilla business. Catarina is separated from her husband, who drank and beat her. She has a total of 7 children ranging in age from 7 to 25. The four younger children live with her. While she is building her own home, they are all  living with a  friend. The house is almost complete, but needs windows and a few other finish items before they move in. \r\nIt has been a long struggle for Catarina but she is persistent. She never had any schooling and speaks only the Cakchiquel language.  Her long-term dream is to be able to open a fruit stand and sell bananas, papaya, apples, pineapples, oranges, and other local fruits. Before receiving micro credits Catarina  had no way to support herself, but now she is on her sixth loan in three years, and she has successfully paid off all previous loans. She says that before receiving the credits she had absolutely no cash and no way to support her family, but as her business has developed she\u2019s very proud of her ability to take care of her children. Perhaps as she is able to continue her success the sadness she feels concerning her family situation and estranged husband will diminish over time."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":50158,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","use":"She will use the

M.

In December when the workers return from the United States to see their family she also buys and sells fruit, since there are many people in the town with money to spend. She knows that the many people returning home miss the wonderful fresh fruits grown in the fertile lands of Guatemala. She will use this loan to buy inventory to restock her stall in the lowlands of Guatemala. Early this year Petrona's husband died after an 8-month-long serious illness during which he could not work. She somehow managed to take care of him and their 5 young children. It has been a very hard struggle. At the end of the day she has very little energy left  after tending her business and taking care of her children. The older three are in school for now but she worries she can not afford the cost of schooling for all five. They wear used clothes or \"American clothing\", hand-me-downs from the US sold here in the markets, but they are clean and well mended. She does the best she can with the help of her sister and her strong faith.  She also gets emotional support from her Friendship Bridge women\u2019s group named \"Luz en el Desierto\" or  \u201clight in the desert\u201d Currently Petrona's dream is to make it through another day and heal from recent the death of her young husband.

A single piglet costs about US$20 when young and will fetch between $65 and $80 when mature. Carmen hopes to buy at least one more piglet with this coming credit, and to continue feeding the others until they're ready for market. Carmen did not have any schooling, and never learned to read or write. But she's making sure that her three children will be able to go to school. The oldest, age 7, is already ahead of her because he's learning to read in the first grade.

him."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":50160,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase and feed

Many times when the family comes up short on the monthly payment for the other kids' schooling, Sonia comes through with a bit of money to make up the difference. \r\n<br\/><br\/>\r\nErlinda has been borrowing with Friendship Bridge credits for four years now, and is requesting a relatively small loan this time, which will be used to invest in more products for Sonia's cosmetics sales. \r\n<br\/><br\/>\r\nErlinda has two boys in school and they're doing well. She herself had no schooling at all, although she can read a bit and write a little. She's committed to the education of the boys, and hopes they'll have better careers as a result."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":50163,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchase

Through reinvestment of her profits over the years, she's grown it into a business that almost supports the whole family and has a pretty good stock.  Some of her best customers are the children who pass by on the way to and from school.

The store now (almost) supports the family, but the monthly payments for school for the youngest three children are still a bit of a crisis every month. She's hopes with great hope for their schooling and that they'll have a better life than she has had. \r\n<br\/><br\/>\r\nFrancisca is a member of the women's group \"Mujeres Prudentes\" and will use

P., 45, buys woven clothing to sell to others. Catarina lost her house to Hurricane Stan in October, 2005, so she no longer has her own house. The land swallowed up her house and everything she owned. The recovery has been slow.\r\n<br\/><br\/>\r\nBefore the hurricane, she used to weave huipiles, colorful Mayan women\u2019s blouses, in her home with a reliable loom. Now she lives in a rented two room house made with concrete block; the old metal window-frames no longer have glass, so she piles up rocks in the window for a bit of privacy. She has a table, an ancient school chair, a mat to sleep on, and a tiny loom she uses to weave cloth bracelets. On the table she displays her complete inventory of eight scarves that she has managed to buy from a friend.\r\n<br\/><br\/>\r\nWith this loan, Catarina plans to buy 24 chicks and feed them. She will sell them when they are full grown. Until that time, she\u2019ll continue to buy yarn and weave the bracelets that are supporting her and her husband. Her ultimate goal is to build a new home near her son\u2019s home up on the hill in one of the many villages near Lake Atitlan.\r\n<br\/><br\/>\r\nAlthough she can make 100 bracelets a day, she cannot afford medical care.
