C. is from the village of Damayuhan, Magsaysay, Misamis Oriental. She is 40 years old. Rosa is married and has two adult children. To make a living, Rosa owns a sari-sari (variety) retail shop which sells both food and daily use products in the local community. Rosa has been engaged in her business for over four years and earns approximately 8,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Rosa joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Rosa has successfully repaid a previous loan of 11,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to invest in expanding the business. Rosa is requesting a new loan of 14,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the 4th loan taken out by Rosa from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

In  the vicinity there are interesting archaeological ruins and the city itself retains remarkable baroque buildings from the colonial era, such as the convent of Carmen, among other tourist attractions the city owns.  On this occasion we can see in the photograph the members with some of their children who accompany them to the meetings of the communal bank.  \r\n\r\nGloria, 32, was married a number of years ago, and conceived 4 children, the second of whom died in an accident at the age of 11.  Of the other children the oldest is 15 years old, and as he does not like to study he remains in the home.  Another is 11 and studies in a local school, and the youngest, who is 3, stays with her.  They do not yet have their own home, so they live in a rented home in the center of the city.\r\n\r\nThis member has a good friendship with all the other members of the small bank, and she joined the group thanks to her sister who already belonged to the bank.  Now the group is in its 2nd loan cycle.  She delivers colas, potato chips, Cheetos, yucca chips, and everything from the Frito Lay and Pepsi brands along with her husband, who drives his own truck.  They have been in this line of work for 10 years.  With the new loan they will pay expenses related to the maintenance of the vehicle, such as expenses for oil changes, tires, and other maintenance.  Her dream is to eventually come to own her own house.\r\n\r\nFlor Ch\u00e1vez, 19, is one of the youngest members of the bank.  She lives in the center of the city of Cuenca and she lives in a common-law marriage with her partner who works in a car dealership.  She is in her 6th month of pregnancy, and they do not have their own home so they rent. \r\n\r\nFlor sells clothing door to door.  She does not have a fixed schedule and she works each day without resting even one day.  She tells us that she started with the business thanks to the first loan that she took from the Fundaci\u00f3n ESPOIR.  She also tells us that thanks to her mother-in-law and brother-in-law she is now a member of this beautiful group of enterprising and go-getting women.  Now that the group is in its second cycle she will take a loan to buy pants, blouses, shirts, bags, underwear, socks, etc. for the whole family.  Her goal is to grow her business and at some point have her own home.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2475,"image":{"id":516727,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to pay for expenses related to vehicle maintenance such as oil change, tires; to acquire pants, shirts, blouses, bags, underwear, and socks ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-03-30T03:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2475,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Carmen Brecilda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariana De Jesus","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Mayra Cristina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esther Amelia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Flor Beatriz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zoila Aurora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gloria Elida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Karina Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Emilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Eugenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2475,"loan_amount":2475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":309.38},{"due_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":309.38},{"due_date":"2010-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":309.38},{"due_date":"2010-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":309.38},{"due_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":309.38},{"due_date":"2010-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":309.38},{"due_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":309.38},{"due_date":"2010-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":309.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":309.38},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":309.38},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":309.38},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":309.38},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":309.38},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":309.38},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":309.38},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":309.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":928.14,"local_amount":928.14,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:18:34Z","rounded_local_amount":928.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136674828,"comment":null},{"amount":309.38,"local_amount":309.38,"processed_date":"2010-05-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:16:40Z","rounded_local_amount":309.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144709008,"comment":null},{"amount":309.38,"local_amount":309.38,"processed_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:16:51Z","rounded_local_amount":309.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144709009,"comment":null},{"amount":309.38,"local_amount":309.38,"processed_date":"2010-06-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:46:35Z","rounded_local_amount":309.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151892305,"comment":null},{"amount":309.38,"local_amount":309.38,"processed_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:46:44Z","rounded_local_amount":309.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151892306,"comment":null},{"amount":309.34,"local_amount":309.34,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:47Z","rounded_local_amount":309.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159632680,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-04-08T22:53:13Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":190113,"name":"Juneper","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Juneper F. is from the village of Tumpagon, Cagayan de Oro City.

Later on, she would like to expand her store and stock it with more merchandise so that she can offer her customers a wider variety of products.\r\n\r\nThis is Carmen\u2019s 9th loan with MFP and she\u2019s determined to repay on time because she doesn\u2019t want to cause any problems to her fellow communal bank members, who hold her in very high esteem.  \r\n\r\nShe will use the requested 1000 new soles to buy more stock items for her store.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":516855,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"To buy stock merchandise.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-03-29T23:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":165}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.63},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.62},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.63},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.62},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.63},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":62.63,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:38:07Z","rounded_local_amount":177.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136718231,"comment":null},{"amount":62.62,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:57Z","rounded_local_amount":177.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751906,"comment":null},{"amount":62.63,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:03:01Z","rounded_local_amount":177.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151934362,"comment":null},{"amount":62.62,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:37:17Z","rounded_local_amount":177.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159673132,"comment":null},{"amount":62.63,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:40:01Z","rounded_local_amount":177.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166886958,"comment":null},{"amount":61.87,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:29Z","rounded_local_amount":175.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172153967,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-03-30T08:56:02Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":190140,"name":"Noli","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Noli S. is from the town of Talakag Bukidnon.

C. is from the village of Magsaysay, Misamis Oriental. She is 52 years old, married and has eight adult children. To make a living, Teodora owns and operates a food stall. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling snacks and other delicacies in the local community. Teodora has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 15,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Teodora joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She is requesting a loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be the first loan she has taken out from HSPFI.

Elvira has been engaged in her business for over four years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Elvira joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from HSPFI. Elvira is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the third loan she has taken out from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

B. is from the village of Duka, Medina, Misamis Oriental.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Madelyn has been engaged in her business for over nine years and earns approximately 15,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Madelyn joined Kiva partner HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Madelyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to invest in expanding the business. Madelyn is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Madelyn from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to support the education of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

O. is from the village of Brgy. 24, Gingoog City. She is 28 years old and married. To make a living, Arnela runs a sari-sari (variety) retail shop, selling a variety of different products in the local community. Arnela has been engaged in her business for over four years and earns approximately $200 a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Arnela joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Arnela has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Arnela is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be her 2nd loan from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the income of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Over time, Estelita has been able to purchase a fishing boat for her husband to manage and use for fishing while she is the one who sells his fish directly to people in the market.\r\n\r\nThe fishing business has brought joy to Estelita\u2019s family, especially to her personally. Because of its profits, she has been able to graduate her eldest 23-year-old child from college. However, her second child has not graduated from college but, nevertheless, Estelita has accepted the fact that she can\u2019t have everything she has expected, especially with their poor economic status. Being a mother, she always wanted to support her son in whatever career he would be taking and that is being a fisherman just like his father.\r\n\r\nWith that, Estelita is requesting a loan from ASHI to be able to purchase another fishing boat for her son. This would not only provide him with employment but would also make their business grow and make more profit, which will enable her to support the education of her two youngest children to college

The main source of income for the business comes from selling both food and daily use products in the local community. Jeneth has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP per month from these activities.\r\n<br>In 2009, Jeneth joined Kiva partner, HSPFI, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from HSPFI. This loan was used to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. Jeneth is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be her second from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About HSPFI<\/b><br>\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

One of her children is in school, and the other is working.  Rosa is a very hard-working person, who has put forth great effort to get ahead as she had to single-handedly raise two children without receiving help from anyone.  She has been making cigars, which she sells to her various customers, for many years.  Customers place orders with her, and she alone makes and sells her product.

In this manner, she would like to get ahead, along with her children.

C. is from the village of Linconcomonan, Gingoog City. She is 49 years old. Clara is married and has 5 adult-aged children. To make a living, Clara owns and operates a business venture running a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food and daily use products in the local community. Clara has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Clara joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Clara is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the 1st loan taken out by Clara from HSPFI.

Because of having a sporadic and very poor economic status, Agustina\u2019s second child has not been able to pursue his college education. However, because of having the opportunity to joining ASHI in 2009, she has able to receive a loan that she used to establish her own business.  Agustina has gained faith that she can support her youngest child\u2019s education in college until graduation.\r\n\r\nBecause of having a very good performance in terms of repayment, attendance at the weekly meeting and in her business during her previous loan from ASHI, Agustina is confident in requesting a much larger loan this time to grow her business and its

O. is from the village of Sto. Nino, Talakag Bukidnon. She is 35 years old. Jessica is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Jessica owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector running a sari-sari (variety) retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food and daily use products in the local community. Jessica has been engaged in her business for over 8 years and earns approximately 4,500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Jessica joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Jessica has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from HSPFI. Jessica is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by Jessica from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the income of the family. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

She is 48 years old. Severina is the group leader of a six-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nSeverina is married and has five school-aged children. To make a living, Severina owns and operates a general store. The main source of income for the business comes from selling both food and daily-use products in the local community. Severina has been engaged in her business for over 17 years and earns approximately 2,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) a month from her business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Severina joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Severina is requesting a loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Severina from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk, and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\nNote: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":517153,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

A Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nazaret A is a group of eight farmers in Oenif Village-Kupang District, East Nusa Tenggara Province. It is situated about 30 km (one hour's drive) from Kupang City. Even though this village is categorized as a remote place, the road into the village is good and has been sealed. There are 35 families who live in the village. The community in Oenif Village relies on farming as their primary income source. The most difficult challenge faced by the community is lack of water for watering their crops. They usually sell their agricultural crops in Inpres Market at Kupang City, as there is no traditional market available in the village. They take motorbike taxis to bring their agricultural crops to Inpres Market as there is no public transport from their village. It costs IDR. 20.000\/ return trip.\r\n\r\nNazaret A Group is led by a 41 year old, Obednego L.. He is married and blessed with three nice children. They are: \r\n- Remli L., 17 years old, who is in the Second Grade of Senior High School\r\n- Reliana L., 14 years old, who is in the Second Grade of Junior High School\r\n- Rismi L., 7 years old, who is in the First Grade of Elementary School\r\n\r\nObednego relies on agricultural crops and the breeding of pigs and goats. Obednego is very concerned about his children\u2019s education. For Obednego education is a priority for his children\u2019s future. Currently, Remli is studying in a Catholic School in So\u2019e - South Central Region of Timor in East Nusa Tenggara Province. It is situated about 150 km from Oenif Village, so they need a lot of money to pay his education costs. He has to send IDR 500,000 per month to pay for his son\u2019s school, living expenses and daily needs. This is one of the reasons why Obednego has to work hard at selling his crops. Fortunately, his wife is able to help him with selling their agricultural crops at the market.\r\n\r\nAs the father of 3 children, Obednego dreams of providing a better life for his family and to support his children\u2019s education through to University. The lack of capital is the main issue for him in improving his family\u2019s living standard. Moreover, he also does not have any other skills to generate further income. One day he heard from the clergyman in the village that the Kiva field partner \u2013 TLM Foundation, assists poor farmers, particularly in West Timor, by providing loans through the Cattle Fattening Program. He is very interested in joining the program as he has experience in fattening livestock and he thinks this program will have a positive impact on his family\u2019s future.   \r\n\r\nObednego discussed it with his neighbours and they are also interested in the program so they formed a group which is called Nazaret A. Obednego is requesting a loan of IDR 3,200,000 to buy a young cow to be fattened over a 12 month period. Other group members are also requesting loans to buy young cattle as they are sure this program is a good way for them to improve their families\u2019 lives. \r\n\r\nNote: Sarlota and Sara were replaced by their family members when the group picture was taken.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2825,"image":{"id":517128,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy cattle to be fattened.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Oenif","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":129,"posted_date":"2010-03-30T17:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2825,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Obednego","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sarlota","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Otniel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Melanus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yohana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yublina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":25600000,"loan_amount":2825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":25600000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2825}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":2825,"local_amount":25600000,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T12:18:13Z","rounded_local_amount":25622750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201364948,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-04-17T04:11:09Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T12:18:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":190313,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"","en":""}},"status":"refunded","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","use":"To pay for his brothers' school fees","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TG","country":"Togo","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"8 1.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":99,"posted_date":"2010-04-03T12:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":100000,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2011-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-20T07:51:06Z","rounded_local_amount":10950.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136670762,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-04-03T15:02:56Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":190314,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":""}},"status":"defaulted","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase additional commodities in bulk for her business.

This requires Mikael to work hard.\r\n\r\nMikael thought that he had to find another option to improve his family\u2019s life and to finance his daugter\u2019s medical treatment. Mikael then got information that TLM Foundation provides a loan through the Cattle Fattening Program for the poor farmers, particularly in the remote places of West Timor. The hope for a better life in the future drove him to join in the program.\r\n\r\nAfter discussions with other farmers who were also interested in joining the program, they then formed Nazaret B Group and applied for the loan. Mikael is requesting a loan amounting to IDR 3,200,000 to buy a young cow to be fattened over a 12 month period. He hopes that the cattle fattening program will enable him to cover all of his family's needs and Reni\u2019s medical treatment. The other group members of Nazaret B are also requesting the loan to buy young cows to fatten. They hope their loans lead them to better lives.\r\n\r\nNote: Agustinus was replaced by his family member when the group picture was

strong determination, Celerina M. believes that through the profits of her hog fattening business, she and the rest of her family will be led to a way out of poverty. That is why she works hard, with the support of her husband, to grow their business. For the financial support that her business needs in order to be enhanced, she is requesting a much larger loan from ASHI. In the hog fattening business, the more piglets being raised and sold either alive or slaughtered after four months, means the profit is as much as double the capital. This will enable Celerina to support the education of her child who is in college, by paying her tuition fees every trimester.

Fatuma thanks you for your support!\r\n<p>\r\n<b>About SELFINA<\/b><br>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of microcredit in Tanzania through microleasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

She lives in the Maica central, which is a neighborhood of the city of Cochabamba to the south. Ana is a hard-working woman who is dedicated to the production of milk.  \r\n\r\nAna is a woman that suffered as a girl with the disaffection of her mother, since there were only two sisters which were treated differently.  She was the younger and only finished a degree in the neighborhood school, while the other sister always studied in expensive schools in the center of the city.  She says that those things do sentimental damage.  Ana does not feel a grudge against her parents but is sure that she would never do that with her children. She earned a technical degree but does not practice it because she is always with her children.  She works from her house producing milk and also making cheeses that she then delivers and sells to a lady.  She does not rely on the salary of a husband.  She goes on alone, always working and helping in the education of her children and collaborating in the care of her father.  Since he is old, he has health problems and she is the one who takes charge of taking him to the doctor.  \r\n\r\nShe needs the loan to buy a head of cattle and in that way enlarge her production of milk and make more cheese.  In this way she will have greater income and sure support for her children so that they can finish school and study for a career.  She feels happy to be with them in all her free time.

years old and has two young children with his wife, Nilda.  They live in Vilomilla which is an area located within the Sipe Sipe province, about 25 km or 30 minutes from the city of Cochabamba.\r\n\r\nAlfredo begins working very early in the morning and his wife helps him milk the cows in order to be able to deliver the milk.  He then helps his wife cut and collect the alfalfa to feed the cows.  It doesn\u2019t matter whether he is tired or sick, he works.  He greatly values his wife and children because, he says, \u201cThese are the things that my father never did with my mother.  He could hear screaming and hitting, but there was never any cooperation.  I don\u2019t want that for my family.  I learned to cooperate when I was very young, but my father was never this way.  He never helped my mother.  He likes to drink and is always drunk, even today.  Thankfully now I\u2019m a man able to help my mother.\u201d\r\n\r\nNilda always lends him her support and she is constantly working on making cheese or planting corn or onions.  She also helps to educate their children, who did not attend school past elementary school.  They hope to one day be able to attend university.\r\n\r\nAlfredo is asking for this loan in order to be able to buy more calves with which to improve his income.  It is insufficient at the moment, but he also works as a mason on the weekends so that his children and his wife want for nothing.  He also helps his mother, who is elderly and has a few problems with her health.  Nilda loves her mother in law very much and takes care of her and this makes him very happy and makes him more optimistic.  Alfredo works hard and struggles to give his family a better life.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Hugo Reyes, Kiva

William has been a carpenter since he was 21 years old and a year ago decided to go it alone and open his own workshop in his house. During the last few months he has done small pieces of work such as repairs, assembling, sanding and varnishing furniture, These orders come in continuously and during his years working with the other carpenter he was able to establish contacts with clients who have followed him thanks to the quality of his work. He works with a special organisation called HUAWEI which helps children with difficulties. This company is one of his most loyal customers and now that William has more work experience they have asked him to make furniture for the institution. This work requires an investment in timber which must be paid for in advance. He will also need a new circular saw and will buy a medium motor and two saws for it. With this loan, William will win more clients through his increased experience. It is for this reason that he is asking for a loan from Kiva. He is very hard-working and responsible despite his young age. He wants to be a well-known carpenter and to have clients who value the quality of his workmanship.

Hilda is requesting a loan of  300,000 TSH in order to purchase additional cloth for her tailoring business  in order  to expand her business. Hilda thanks you for your support!\n\nAbout SELFINA:\nSELFINA has taken a leading role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use their equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":517370,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","use":"To purchase additional cloth for her tailoring business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Morogoro","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.816667 37.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hilda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2011-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2011-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":190424,"name":"Agnes","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Agnes is the 39-year-old single mother of four children.

Her work begins by dividing the products into portions using scales and making small packets of bird food: 250 and 500 grammes of mixed seeds, grains or bird feed. Then she sells them from her stall. She also weighs out the same size packs of yuca and potatoes. These products are delivered to order every fortnight to the town's supermarkets. These same supermarkets are also asking her to make up packets of organic quinoa, amaranth, barley and other things for the coming months. This is why the lady is asking for this loan as she needs money to buy these things. She needs corn and barley flour and broad beans. Thes products form the basis of the daily diet in many homes throughout the country.

is a woman who says she is \u201cat the prime of life!\u201d  She has two daughters who are both grown up now. One has already completed her university studies and the other is completing university soon.  She is very proud of them both for their schooling and commented that education \u201cis the best gift you can give your child.\u201d \r\n\r\nBetty describes herself as a very hard-working woman. She says that you have to be hard working if you are in the business of poultry farming because it is such an involved business.  Betty raises layers (chickens that are raised for consumption) behind her home. Currently she thinks she has between 200-400 chickens.  She buys them when they are one day old and then she raises them till they are fat enough to sell.\r\n\r\nThere are some real challenges in this business because there is a lot of competition for a small market.  In the areas where Betty sells there are lots of hotels and restaurants that want to buy her chickens, but many people know this in her neighborhood \u2013 so people are competing to be able to sell. \r\n\r\nIt is too bad when there is too much competition because it forces poultry farmers to keep their chicken until they are too large.  In order to keep the chickens growing and healthy, it is a must that you keep feeding them well, but the more you spend on feed per chicken the lower your profit margin. \r\n\r\nBetty is taking a loan today for 40,000 KSH.  She hopes to be able to buy a few hundred more chicks with this amount, as well as the feed to make them grow! In the future, she hopes to be able to buy a plot of land, both where she can build a good home and also so that she can build some other homes where people can rent from her.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":517389,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","use":"200

This will be the second loan taken out by Shella May from HSPFI.

Con este ingreso ella y su esposo pueden mantener a su familia.\n\nLa continua demanda por cerdos en la zona han hecho que ella est\u00e9 pensando en ampliar su negocio, por ese motivo se ha visto en la necesidad de solicitar a Edpyme Alternativa un cr\u00e9dito de 1500 nuevos soles que piensa invertir en la compra de cerdos medianos, alimento balaceado y en la mejora de los corrales en donde los cr\u00eda, ya que no cuenta con el suficiente espacio para realizar esta acci\u00f3n.\n\nJuana es una madre de familia bastante responsable y trabajadora.

She breeds the animals in the back of her house and sells them to the dealers who visit the area where she lives. This activity is very important to their family income since her husband is a farmer and this occupation does not provide a consistent income.\r\n<p>\r\nThe need to support their family has also caused them to start saving money to buy a motorcycle taxi which they currently lease to offer transportation services in the area. With this income she and her husband can support their family.\r\n<p>\r\nThe continued demand for pigs in the region has gotten her thinking about expanding her business and to do this she has seen the necessity of asking for a loan from Edpyme Alternativa for 1500 nuevos soles to buy pigs, balanced feed, and improve the pens they live in since currently their is not enough space.\r\n<p>\r\nJuana is a very hardworking and responsible mother to her family.  Her biggest wish is to be able to offer her children the opportunity to study and have a promising future.

This community is located 45 minutes away from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n<p>\r\nPaula has been selling poultry and pigs for twelve years.  She sells the poultry to traders who usually visit the area.  In addition, she buys pigs to raise and then sells the meat by the kilo after butchering them.  This business is of great importance to her family because it provides the necessary resources for them to move forward.  Her neighbors request meat from her to consume because it is not readily available since the area where they live is located far away from the nearest market.   \r\n<p>\r\nPaula wants to expand her business by buying poultry, medium-sized pigs, and balanced animal feed.  Since she does not have enough capital to do this, she is requesting her first loan from Edpyme Alternativa in the amount of 1200 PEN.

For this reason, she is requesting her first loan from Edpyme Alternativa in the amount of 500 PEN so that she can invest in the purchase of groceries and achieve her objective.

She lives with her sister who works as a merchant along with her two daughters and a niece who are all minors and are studying. For the past six years Vilma has been making cheese. She sells her cheese in the Cojutepeque market, at a place where they sell different types of frozen chicken. This is a good business for her as she is able to provide for her children\u2019s food and education. Vilma is asking for this loan so that she can buy the ingredients she needs to make her cheese. It is artesian cheese that she makes in her home. She is able to easily sell the cheese as she provides a large variety of it and her prices are a little cheaper than processed cheese.
