Hern\u00e1ndez is 50 years old and lives in the Moras IV Etapa neighborhood in the town of Soledad, south of Barranquilla. He says that his neighborhood is relatively safe with very cooperative neighbors.  He is married and has a 28 year old son. He has a business in his home where he sells merchandise, espcecially clothing and shoes. He does this with his wife and it is why he is asking for a loan of $1.600.000, to buy the described merchandise.\r\n\r\nGilberto used to work with furniture and products for the home. He also worked as a messenger for 17 years until 1997, when he stopped because the business went broke. When he received his severance, he began to travel to Magangue, a town in the department of Bol\u00edvar on the shores of the  Magdalena river, the most important river in Colombia.  Gilberto would bring fish from Magangue which he would sell. His wife also would make and sell bolis, a type of Colombian ice cream. She sells it now in the Estadio Metropolitano when there are soccer games. In addition to selling the bolis, both of them sell ice cream, candy and merchandise such as clothes, shoes and acccesories from the house.  \r\n\r\nThis is his second loan and he invested the last one in improving the selection of merchandise in his business. In the future, he dreams of having a bigger business in a good location. Setting it up is also his biggest challenge since money is required. Additionally, his goal is to establish a workshop for his son, who is taking classes in automotive technology and vehicular gas technology in the SENA, a national organization that encourages learning. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ellen Donohue, Kiva

Among other products, from her refrigerator she sells products such as Boli, ice, bags of water. She is asking for 1,000,000 COP  to buy drinks and other merchandise like towels, bedspreads and other products that women might like.\r\n\r\nShe started her business in 1975 when she came to live in Barranquilla from Caucasia, which is in the Antioquia department. There she used to earn a living washing clothes. Her partner used to work as a day laborer. When she arrived in Barranquilla, she settled in the Gal\u00e1n neighborhood where she continued with the same work. Since she is elderly, four years later her eldest daughter asked her to move in with her and help her keep house. When she moved to the 7 de Abril neighborhood and began to live with her daughter, she started selling drinks like beer and soda in very commercial neighborhoods. As soon as this began to go well she sold her house in the Gal\u00e1n neighborhood and moved completely to the 7 de Abril neighborhood and bought a house near her daughter. Now, she lives in a new neighborhood, and a new house. Here she is able to take advantage of the fact that she lives near several sports events, like a soccer field, and sell drinks like soda, beer, a local drink called pony malta and bit by bit begin to sell other merchandise.  \r\n\r\nFor the last 5 years she has been a client of Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and has taken out five loans which has helped her to keep working and increase the capital she needs to cover her personal expenses. Her immediate desire is to fix her fridge which right now, is at 50% capacity, and to install bars on her house to protect it from the soccer balls that hit it during matches.\r\n<br

G., which is located in Santa Rita Tlahuapan, San Salvador el Verde, in Puebla, Mexico. \r\n\r\nThis group has 11 members.  Maria has a business cultivating plants that she started 3 years ago.  Maria did not have the opportunity to study, but she has made an effort to give her daughter an education.  Her daughter is currently in her 3rd year of high school.  She lives in a common-law marriage and this is the first time that she has requested a loan from CREDICOMUN to invest in seeds and land to plant and materials to make her pots.\r\n\r\nShe is very proud of having requested this loan, which will allow her to have a much greater variety of plants and small trees.  In addition, she hopes that with the loan she will have more resources to pay for the education of her daughter, as she wants to see her succeed and have a good career.\r\n\r\nGabriela S. N., in the same group, sells food.  She completed her primary studies through the 3rd year.  She is divorced and has 2 sons and a daughter who is 6 months old.  She has had this business for 4 years, and she requests the loan to buy a stove with several grills to make it easier for her to serve her customers, who return to her family eatery for the flavorful food.  At the moment of requesting this loan she is very excited because her current stove is too small.  In addition she hopes that with the help of the loan she can continue to support her children.  \r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are:\r\n\r\nMARIA GUILLERMINA C.

pasajeros en su motocarro. Lo que m\u00e1s desea es brindarle una buena educaci\u00f3n a sus dos querida hijas, Celeste y Antuanette.\n\nDesde muy joven se vio en la necesidad de trabajar para tener un sustento econ\u00f3mico, puesto que a los 15 a\u00f1os ya era madre y ten\u00eda una hija qu\u00e9 mantener. Fue as\u00ed que su cu\u00f1ada, con el af\u00e1n de ayudarla, la contrat\u00f3 como ayudante en el puesto de comida que tiene en el mercado mayorista de la ciudad, donde ahora trabaja sirviendo los platos y apoyando en todas las labores de la cocina.\nLisely disfruta mucho de cocinar y no desaprovecha las escasas oportunidades que le brinda su cu\u00f1ada, cuando le pide que cocine y se encargue del negocio. Lleva 6 a\u00f1os realizando esta actividad y considera que lo m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil es atender a todos los comensales al mismo tiempo. \nEn los pr\u00f3ximos meses planea implementar su propio puesto de comida, ya que siente que es hora de tener su negocio propio.\n\nEste es el quinto pr\u00e9stamo al que accede Lisely con MFP y al igual como hizo con sus anteriores pr\u00e9stamos, desea pagarlo a tiempo y sin dificultades.

She lives in the house her in-laws left to her husband Vidal, 30 years old, who transports passengers in his motorized trishaw. Her fondest wish is to offer her two darling daughters, Celeste and Antuanette, a good education.\r\n\r\nFrom early on she saw it was necessary to work to make a living, since by 15 years old she was already a mother with a daughter to support. Her sister-in-law, wanting to help her out, hired her as an assistant in her food stall in the city market, where Lisely now works serving customers and helping with all the kitchen duties.\r\n\r\nLisely really enjoys cooking and takes full advantage of the few opportunities her sister-in-law gives her when she asks her to cook and take care of the business. She's been working in the food stall for six years, and what she finds most challenging is attending to all the customers at once.

D. Mart\u00ednez, 50, lives in the El Carmelo neighborhood of Cartagena with her husband and their 2 children, aged 26 and 23.  Her children are her greatest motivation.  She sells general merchandise in a business for which she is requesting a loan of 1.8 million Colombian pesos, which will be invested in the purchase of pants, sheets, towels, school shirts, blouses, and other items demanded by her customers, who are from the various neighborhoods of the city.  \r\n\r\nLucila P. D. Mart\u00ednez was employed by a company, but was laid off so that only her husband was working, and a single income was not enough.  Her uncle, who lives in the United States, helped her by sending merchandise that she could sell to her colleagues from her former job, her friends and her neighbors.  As each day the demand for her merchandise was increasing, Lucila started to travel to Medell\u00edn, Barranquilla and Bucaramanga and was opening new markets.  She claims that her business has been the source of significant income at home and even more so when her husband is unemployed and her business must generate the income to pay for the household expenses and the education of their children. Her market is maD. up of neighbors and employees of companies in the city of Cartagena, to whom she supplies clothing, uniforms, blouses, pants and any other items her customers require.\r\n\r\nLucila is grateful to God for her family and for having given her the creativity that she has needed every day to accomplish her goals with a lot of love, thereby getting everything she has in her home and all that her children have needed (education, clothing, entertainment and basic necessities.)\r\n\r\nThis is the 2nd loan that she has received from the Fundaci\u00f3n Santo Domingo.  With the first she bought general merchandise and expanded her customer base.  Her life has changed with this business, since she can now offer her children a better quality of life, and this provides her with a lot of  personal satisfaction.  In her business she was able to offer better services to more customers with different needs.  Her dream is to see her business grow, to have employees, and to offer her services to many more people and become well-known.  Another of her dreams is that her children become happy with their professions, which she believes is the best legacy that she can leave them, and to have her own home.  This latter dream is currently her greatest challenge. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva

L. wished to be enlightened and find a way to improve her family's standard of living, so she joined Kiva partner, ASHI, in 1999 and felt very glad to be given the opportunity of a loan. Her first few loans enabled her to support her variety store and tend to her canteen eatery (preparation of food ready to eat), the profits of which have been the main source of family income. Now that Marilou has access to capital, her profits are better than before. Therefore, she is requesting another ASHI loan through Kiva for a much larger amount of 40,000 PHP to purchase groceries for her store and to support the maintenance of the canteen eatery. This will allow her to further grow the businesses so that her children can fulfill their dreams of completing college degrees and finding good jobs.<p>\r\n\r\nMarilou also dreams of achieving the best for her family, reflected in an expanded business and a happy family. During the course of her membership in ASHI, she has shown herself to be hard-working and strong-minded in pursuing these dreams. Her long term goals are to launch a poultry business for her husband so she can expand their weekly revenue. With her hard work, focus, and determination, Marilou is hopeful that her businesses will continue to be more productive and improve the family's overall standard of living.<p>\r\n\r\nMarilou is happy that her living conditions have improved through the generation of more income from the businesses. She would like to send all her best wishes to all of her lenders around the world and hopes that they will support her again in the future.<p>\r\n\r\nAbout ASHI:<p>\r\n \r\nAs a micro-finance institution that uses the Grameen methodology, Ahon sa Hirap (ASHI), being the first practitioner in the field, saw how poor  mothers work hard to earn money for their families and provide their children with better lives.\r\n\r\nBecause the micro-credit that ASHI is extending to these women is delivered directly to their villages and on the doorstep of their houses, it is giving them hope that someday they will rise above poverty.

L. is from the village of Dalipuga, Iligan City. She is 60 years old, married and has nine school-aged children. To make a living, Ambrocia owns and operates a sari-sari (variety) retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling both food and daily use products in the local community. Ambrocia has been engaged in her business for over 15 years and earns approximately 4,500 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Ambrocia joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from HSPFI. Ambrocia is requesting a new loan of 11,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the third loan she has taken out from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to support her children's education. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Lucille has been engaged in her business for over seven years and earns approximately 2010 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Lucille joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand the products offered. This will be the first loan she has taken out from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

Julieta is requesting a new loan of 7000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be the second loan she has taken out from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

She says that the extra income from this loan will help her educate her child and also will assist in the expansion of her farm.

Their aim is to diversify their business activities through raising small ruminant animals which would be re-sold if necessary, or used for social occasions (weddings or baptisms). \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Danielle Treharne, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1525,"image":{"id":514079,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","use":"Purchasing cereals","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Kamakono S\u00e9gou","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-03-26T22:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatoumata        ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamou            ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fanta                     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bouh                      ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mah                  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mafoune       ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dj\u00e8n\u00e8ba        ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadia            ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nah              ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ata                    ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":750000,"loan_amount":1525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2010-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2010-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2010-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2010-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":125000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":254.17},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":254.16},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":254.17},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":254.17},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":254.16},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":254.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":254.17,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2010-04-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:15:20Z","rounded_local_amount":125080.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136746593,"comment":null},{"amount":254.16,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:29Z","rounded_local_amount":125080.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144779143,"comment":null},{"amount":254.17,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:16:39Z","rounded_local_amount":125080.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151961343,"comment":null},{"amount":254.17,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:35Z","rounded_local_amount":125080.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159699461,"comment":null},{"amount":254.16,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:58:12Z","rounded_local_amount":125080.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166913380,"comment":null},{"amount":254.17,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:41:10Z","rounded_local_amount":125080.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172180550,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-03-27T19:56:59Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:41:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":188861,"name":"Agnes","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Agnes is 31 years old and married with one child who goes to school.

They live in Palca Grande, 90 kilometers from the city of Sacaba.  They are humble, low-income people that lack funds to enlarge their grocery store.  They sell basic needs items: rice, sugar, pasta, cooking oil, salt and liquefied gas.  Additionally, they farm tubers (potatoes).  The community is quite removed from the city; public transportation in the area is sporadic, buses are available once a week only.\r\n\r\nEdwin lacks funds to increase his grocery inventory so he needs funding to do so.  His store is the only one in the area that provides these basic need items.  It is very difficult for them to go to traditional banks in the city to solicit loans.  CIDRE is closer and works with rural communities so they are able to call upon it to request loans to improve their business.\r\n\r\nEdwin\u2019s wife, Miguelina, tells us that her greatest dream is that her daughter become a nurse.  In order for this to happen, she must have funds enough and savings to pay for her studies.  Her hope is that she would later come back to work in the community because many women suffer illnesses and her daughter could then help the humble people of her community.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":514109,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy stock inventory.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Cochabamba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.383333 -66.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":140,"posted_date":"2010-03-25T18:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edwin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1000,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:37:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206128975,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-04-10T11:31:40Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T10:37:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":188882,"name":"Margaret","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Margaret is 29 years old, married and has three children.

Despite starting out with a borrowed cell phone and not being very successful at selling service minutes near the university, he kept trying in other parts of town and he set himself up for business in his home.\r\n\r\nHe used his two prior loans to buy computers that today make up the core of his Internet caf\u00e9 business.  In addition to his four computer Internet service, he has four phone lines available and also sells soft-drinks, candy and snacks.\r\n\r\nHe is currently asking for a $2.300.000 loan to buy a photocopying machine and another computer which will allow him to provide better service.\r\n\r\nHe feels that he has grown a lot in the two years that he\u2019s had his business; that the training opportunities have helped him quite a bit and he has become better organized in his business thus producing higher income for his family.\r\n\r\nDespite his success, however, he sometimes feels that he doesn\u2019t have the necessary resources to have more equipment and enlarge his business as he\u2019d like to in order to meet increased customer demand.\r\n\r\nIn addition to facing this challenge, his goal is to enlarge his business to have everything related to stationery.  He also dreams with owning his own house because he and his family currently live in an uncle\u2019s house.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva

old and was born in the city of La Paz in Bolivia before she came to Cochabamba where she lives in the Villa Esmeralda development. \r\n<p>\r\nShe left the city of La Paz for her daughter who suffers from epileptic attacks; the climate of La Paz was not helping her recovery.  She has three children, one who has already left for university and the others who go to high school although she lives alone because her husband stayed in La Paz to work since if he left he would not be able to help with the education of their children.\r\n<p>\r\nMrs. Rosse Mary has a store in the neighborhood where she lives. Rosse Mary had left her job in La Paz and couldn't find work here in the city of Cochabamaba.  She had been a secretary but because of the poor economic state of the country and her age she was sure she would be unable to find work. In order to have an income and be able to help out with the household without depending entirely on her husband she decided to open a store even though the profits are not large.\r\n<p>\r\nShe needs a loan in order to increase the store's merchandise and increase the variety of products she sells in order to have more customers when they see that the store is complete. If this happens she will be able to stay with her daughter and always be able to help her because she is afraid that her daughter is suffering and cannot count on help from her mother, because the school knows about Ana's problem.\r\n<p>\r\nRosse Mary is a very responsible woman, very hardworking, and dedicated to her children. Her dream is for her three children to finish university and be able to reach for a better future.  She gives them all she has both economically and spiritually to teach them to be good people. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Cathy Coffman, Kiva

She is the coordinator for her group, <i>Sabanalamarino<\/i> (\"Sabana the Sailor\") and her story is representative of other Dominican and Haitian borrowers at Esperanza International.\r\n\r\nEvelyn is a single mother who lives with her three children in Hato Mayor, a small rural town in the heart of the agricultural east in the Dominican Republic. Life in rural areas of the Dominican Republic can be rough, with no potable running water, frequent power outages (if one has power to begin with), and inadequate access to health care among other dangers. Despite these difficulties, Evelyn has a successful small business selling new clothing to her friends and those in her community. With this loan, she plans to purchase new clothing for resale.\r\n\r\nThis is Evelyn\u2019s fourth loan with Esperanza International; in a year and a half, she has been able to more than double her loan size, a true testament to her hard work. With continued profits, Evelyn hopes to keep the growth of her business going. Evelyn\u2019s profits have already improved her family\u2019s living conditions, and she looks forward to continuing that trend.

Most of its residents work in growing rice and flowers and in handicrafts and trade.    \r\n\r\nFor more than 8 years, she has been selling salted fish in a stall located inside the Modelo market (the main market of the city of Chiclayo). This market is a supply center with a large number of people. All types of basic items are offered there: vegetables, clothing, groceries, hardware, and more. It is more than 50 years old and most of the businesses of the city of Chiclayo are there, large and small, due to its central location.  \r\n\r\nThis business is the only source of income that supports her daughter and it helps her family with the family expenses.  Zuleida is asking Edpyme Alternativa for a loan of 2000 nuevos soles that she is planning on investing in buying more fresh fish to process and sell. Holy Week is coming, and during that time the consumption of salted fish is massive and in high demand. This is why she must make the purchase ahead of time.\r\n\r\nShe is fighter, dedicated to her work and family. She has worked with our institution and has shown herself to always be punctual and responsible in making her payments.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ellen Donohue, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":514200,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","use":"To buy fresh fish to process and sell.

His only income comes in the winter season from the harvest of basic grains.\r\n\r\nHe started this work activity by only planting beans and corn.  When he sold these grains he bought a small bull to raise.  Once it gained weight, he sold it for a higher price than he had paid for it.\r\n\r\nOrlando works by cultivating beans and corn in the winter time.  In the summer, he buys livestock to sell for another income.  He has always worked in farming.  He now also works as a small producer of livestock.\r\n\r\nHe hopes that with this loan he will have a way to work year round.  At the same time, he will have an alternative way to generate income in the summer.  That is when he does not have income from the harvest.\r\n\r\nOrlando has been improving his work with the loans.

D. lives in Barranquilla\u2019s 20 de Julio housing project, which is both a commercial and residential area.  She manufactures children\u2019s clothing and needs a $1.500.000 loan to buy raw materials like fabric, ribbon, lace and thread at wholesale and retail.\r\n\r\nShe started her business in 1990 having learned to be a seamstress in Bucaramanga.  She was employed at a tailor shop but later became independent and currently works with her daughter, who does the cutting, and another worker, who does the finishing on the items and who uses her skills to decorate and adorn them, and with Susana who designs and sews; she works a long shift from 8am to 8pm because she adores her art.\r\n\r\nLuzalva M. sells by the dozen to customers in a shopping center near her shop called, Metrocentro and to customers located in colmenas (densely populated apartment buildings) in downtown Barranquilla.  Competition is high but she is preferred thanks to the quality of her finishing and her strict adherence to delivery schedules.  She buys most of her raw materials weekly but some of them like, details, buttons and decorations, every three days.\r\n\r\nThis is her 9th loan through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, an organization she has been collaborating with for 12 years, both in loan programs and in training sessions.  Being tied to these processes has made it possible for her to modernize her equipment.  This is how she was able to purchase two over lock sewing machines (special sewing machines to do finishing on garments) and do some home improvements to her apartment.\r\n\r\nHer great dream is to set up a store in a prestigious shopping center but she knows that she must wait and continue to make merchandising efforts that will help her increase production and sales of children\u2019s clothes in order to generate at least one additional job.  This is precisely her great challenge.\r\n\r\n  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva

Those foodstuffs include rice, sugar, Irish potatoes, beans etc.  With these additional goods for sale, Jonas hopes to earn more profits, which in turn will allow him to create some other sources of income by reinvesting some of his profits.  In doing so, he will be able to create jobs for the people from his community.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":511371,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"The purchase of rice, sugar, Irish potatoes, beans etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"RW","country":"Rwanda","town":"Gasabo Remera Kigali","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":117,"posted_date":"2010-03-26T13:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jonas ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"RWF","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":62500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.38},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.37},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.38},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.37},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.38},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.37},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.38},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":109.38,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:36:44Z","rounded_local_amount":63648.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136760477,"comment":null},{"amount":109.37,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-17T08:10:55Z","rounded_local_amount":63648.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":145022903,"comment":null},{"amount":109.38,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-21T07:57:09Z","rounded_local_amount":63648.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152781962,"comment":null},{"amount":109.37,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:17:01Z","rounded_local_amount":63648.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159709849,"comment":null},{"amount":109.38,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-16T09:28:00Z","rounded_local_amount":63648.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":167037206,"comment":null},{"amount":109.37,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T09:44:53Z","rounded_local_amount":63648.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172308914,"comment":null},{"amount":109.38,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-25T11:35:15Z","rounded_local_amount":63648.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177616512,"comment":null},{"amount":109.37,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:49:57Z","rounded_local_amount":63648.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182622721,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-04-05T19:07:46Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T15:49:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":188989,"name":"Afia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Afia N. is single and has received senior high education.

Ram\u00edrez is 19 years old and lives in the Gual\u00ed neighborhood of Bogot\u00e1, the capital of Colombia. Angie is very environmentally conscious and she wants to work towards a culture of environmental protection. That's why she works making bags of various types out of a biodegradable material called Cambrell. With this business she not only produces and generates earnings for herself; she also generates earnings for the group of single mothers who work making the final products. This is the first time she has taken out a loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo [the Kiva field partner] and she is asking for 1,000,000 Colombian pesos to invest in fibers such as jute and Cambrell. She also needs to pay for extra labor to work on an special order, because she already has her regular production planned out with the women who work making the bags. \r\n\r\nAngie's greatest dream is to create a mentality of environmental consciousness and to reduce the use of plastic bags in supermarkets and among housewives in particular. Her challenge is to see her business, called Organika M & E, grow and be recognized locally, nationally and then internationally level. This is why she has started out with her own business at such a young age. Angie is very enterprising and is happy with the neighborhood she lives in. She says the neighborhood has an ecologically conscious feel, as it is surrounded by green space and inhabited by honest and hard-working people. This is why the public spaces where she lives are so safe. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Catherine Fountain, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":514290,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"To invest in fibers such as jute and Cambrell and pay for the labor on a special order","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2010-03-26T01:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Angie Katherine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":82544},{"due_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":75930},{"due_date":"2010-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":77512},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":79127},{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":80776},{"due_date":"2010-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":82458},{"due_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":84176},{"due_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":85930},{"due_date":"2010-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":87720},{"due_date":"2011-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":89548},{"due_date":"2011-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":91413},{"due_date":"2011-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":82866}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.34},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.86},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.69},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.54},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.41},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.29},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.19},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.12},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.05},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.01},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":43.34,"local_amount":82544,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:33:01Z","rounded_local_amount":83668.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136677901,"comment":null},{"amount":39.86,"local_amount":75930,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:18:59Z","rounded_local_amount":76963.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144712298,"comment":null},{"amount":40.69,"local_amount":77512,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:47:38Z","rounded_local_amount":78567.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151895799,"comment":null},{"amount":41.54,"local_amount":79127,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:11:57Z","rounded_local_amount":80204.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159636125,"comment":null},{"amount":42.41,"local_amount":80776,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:17:20Z","rounded_local_amount":81875.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166850222,"comment":null},{"amount":43.29,"local_amount":82458,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:01:10Z","rounded_local_amount":83580.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177410855,"comment":null},{"amount":43.49,"local_amount":82842,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:08:58Z","rounded_local_amount":83970.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182550511,"comment":null},{"amount":45.57,"local_amount":86796,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:14:18Z","rounded_local_amount":87977.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188688114,"comment":null},{"amount":141.31,"local_amount":269149,"processed_date":"2011-02-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-16T08:39:46Z","rounded_local_amount":272814.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196000769,"comment":null},{"amount":43.5,"local_amount":82866,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:17:57Z","rounded_local_amount":83994.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211230587,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-03-26T03:56:38Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T11:17:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":188993,"name":"Cath\u00e9rine","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"M.

She lives in the Compartir La Margarita neighborhood in the southwestern part of Bogot\u00e1.

Her dressmaking shop is also located in this neighborhood\u2014her business is called \u201cDotaciones Macedy\u201d, and she started it about 7 years ago.  During the last 5 years she was training and she is currently making a living entirely from dressmaking.\r\n\r\nThis is Martha\u2019s second loan.  She used her previous loan to purchase a sewing machine and an overlock stitching machine, which made it possible for her to generate more profits in her business.  She wants to invest her current loan in raw materials, supplies, and a cutting table.  She says that one of her biggest challenges is not having a cutting table, since she has to go to a friend\u2019s shop to cut cloth and then go back to work at her own shop.  In the longer term, her dream is to expand her shop so that she can provide jobs for other mothers who are supporting families.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Christopher Knutson,

T. tiene 56 a\u00f1os y vive en Barranquilla en el barrio Me Quejo, nombre que demuestra el buen sentido de humor propio de los barranquilleros. Est\u00e1 separado y tiene dos hijos de 27 y 10 a\u00f1os de edad: la mayor est\u00e1 terminando su licenciatura en m\u00fasica y es bailarina de ballet, mientras el menor estudia. Gustavo proviene del departamento de Norte de Santander, lleg\u00f3 a Barranquilla desde  joven y empez\u00f3 su \u00fanico negocio hace 7 a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s de terminar de vender mercanc\u00edas, como el champ\u00fa, de puerta a puerta. El negocio de Gustavo se llama \u201cProductos Naturales Renacer\u201d y \u00e9l elabora productos alimenticios naturales, como la fibra, la granola y la avena. Por ser un pa\u00eds donde casi toda la poblaci\u00f3n come mucha carne o mucho pescado, no es com\u00fan encontrar a alguien como Gustavo que es vegetariano desde hace 30 a\u00f1os. Fue su vegetarianismo que lo impuls\u00f3 a estudiar la comida vegetariana y le dio la idea de iniciar su negocio; cuando comenz\u00f3 no ten\u00eda m\u00e1s que una cacerola para elaborar sus productos. Ahora los prepara en un horno y durante sus 3 a\u00f1os de cr\u00e9ditos con la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo ha podido comprar una nevera, un molino y otros implementos necesarios para aumentar la producci\u00f3n. Adem\u00e1s, a trav\u00e9s de los programas de la Fundaci\u00f3n, adquiri\u00f3 su registro de INVIMA, ente que controla y vigila la calidad de productos alimenticios en Colombia. Actualmente comercializa sus alimentos en restaurantes vegetarianos y tiendas naturalistas de Barranquilla, pero su meta es poder penetrar en los almacenes de cadena y as\u00ed promocionarlos, hecho que tambi\u00e9n es su mayor desaf\u00edo, visto que en estos momentos no tiene los recursos para dar este paso.\nAhora solicita un cr\u00e9dito de $2.000.000 que quiere invertir en fibra y en aumentar la producci\u00f3n de su turr\u00f3n de ajonjol\u00ed, man\u00ed, coco y miel. Acaba de empezar con los turrones y han tenido mucho \u00e9xito, pero es necesario invertir un dinero para tener mayor capacidad. Gustavo tambi\u00e9n piensa en impulsar sus productos m\u00e1s con tarjeticas que quiere imprimir y m\u00e1s adelante, sue\u00f1a con tener su propia vivienda en Villas San Pablo, macroproyecto de domicilios donde la Fundaci\u00f3n fundamenta la construcci\u00f3n de una comunidad sana.\n","en":"Gustavo A. T. is 56 years old.  He lives in Barranquilla in the neighborhood Me Quejo (\"I complain\"), a name demonstrating the barranquilleros' good sense of humor.  Gustavo is separated from his wife and has two kids, who are 27 and 10 years old.  His eldest daughter is a ballet dancer finishing her degree in music, while his younger child studies.\r\n\r\nGustavo is from the department of Northern Santander.  He came to Barranquilla when he was young and started his own business seven years later after selling merchandise, like shampoo, door to door.  Gustavo's business is named \"Productos Naturales Renacer\"  (\"Natural Products Reborn\"), and he makes natural food products like fiber, granola, and oatmeal.  In a country where nearly all the population eats a lot of meat or a lot of fish, it is uncommon to find someone like Gustavo, who has been a vegetarian for thirty years. \r\n\r\nIt was his vegetarianism that led Gustavo to study vegetarian food and gave him the idea to start his business.  When he started, he only had one pan to make his food.  Now he prepares the food in an oven, and during his three years of loans with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation he has been able to buy a refrigerator, meat grinder, and other kitchen tools necessary to increase his production.  Additionally, through the Foundation's programs, he obtained his registration with INVIMA, the organization that controls and oversees the quality of food products in Colombia.  Currently, he sells his products in vegetarian restaurants and natural food stores in Barranquilla.  His goal is to break into the chain grocery store market and promote his products there.  His biggest goal is also his biggest challenge, seeing as he currently lacks the funds necessary to reach this step.\r\n\r\nGustavo is asking for a loan of  $2.000.000, which he wants to invest in fiber and increasing his production of nougat candy made of sesame, peanut, coconut, and honey.  He recently started making nougat candy and he has been very successful, but it is necessary to invest money to have a greater cooking capacity.  Gustavo is also thinking about promoting his products with cards he wants to print.  In the future, he dreams about having his own home in Villas San Pablo, a macroproject of houses where the Foundation has started the construction of a healthy community.\r\n<br

One of the members is Dina, who is a 51 year old mother of five; three of her children are already living on their own. \r\n\r\nMany years ago, Dina was working selling shoes. She herself would travel to other parts of the country to buy shoes to sell in Lima. However, due to the poor government at that time, travel tickets and product costs increased significantly, so Dina had to stop traveling and stop working on her business.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Dina sells candies and sweets such as gelatin, puddings, cakes, pastries, etc, a business which she operates from the entryway to her home. She's been working at this business for 8 years, starting with just 35 gelatin molds. Now, she has 90 molds which she distributes to her steady customers and to those who would like to try her products.\r\n\r\nShe started with the idea of wanting to earn more money to cover the expenses of running her home and since then, she has been able to get involved in the sweets business. Also, thanks to her earnings, she has been able to educate her children and finish building her home. \r\n\r\nThe loan itself would be used for work capital, since her plan is to improve her business.\r\n\r\nDina's dream would be to have a pair of shops insiD. a mall to rent them out and be able to gain a steady monthly income. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Raquel Perez-Lopez, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1775,"image":{"id":514347,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"Work Capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"San Juan de Lurigancho-Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.033333 -77.016667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:35Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1775,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Angelica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dina Ysabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosario Yanet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yolanda Mirta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Myriam Patricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatriz Hilda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cesar Augusto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa Ermida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Erlinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":5050,"loan_amount":1775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1263},{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1263},{"due_date":"2010-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1263},{"due_date":"2010-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1261}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":443.93},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":443.92},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":443.93},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":443.22}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":443.93,"local_amount":1263,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:08:01Z","rounded_local_amount":1270.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136661465,"comment":null},{"amount":443.92,"local_amount":1263,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:06:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1270.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144694127,"comment":null},{"amount":443.93,"local_amount":1263,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:37:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1270.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151877091,"comment":null},{"amount":443.22,"local_amount":1261,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:49:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1268.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159617063,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-04-19T11:04:12Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T10:49:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":189026,"name":"Maame","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maame A. sells plastic containers, utensils and oranges at Jukwa.
