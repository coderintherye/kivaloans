She is married to Rolando, a supervisor in a company, and is a mother to their children. She, together with her husband and children, manage their own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to save for the future of her children.\r\n\r\nRoslie operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 PHP-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Roslie earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of about $11 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 10,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and firewood to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nRoslie hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she hopes to save money for the future.

age 33, operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails individual grocery items, toiletries, and beverages to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy such items as one sachet of shampoo, Php 5 worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Leah earns her living by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 240 in sales per day.\r\n\r\nLeah lives with her partner, Randy, and their children in Caloocan City. Randy works as a school service driver, so Leah manages the household while operating her business. She is working hard to continually provide income for the family's everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 8,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nLeah hopes to be able to expand her shop soon, just as she hopes to improve on their standard of living and give her children an increasingly good future. \r\n\r\nAll CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

It served as a key post along the Silk Road and marked the end of Alexander the Great's extensive rule. It was the birthplace of the great Persian poet Rudaki and famous Islamic philosopher Ibn Sina. And it is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. \r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON\u2019s History<\/b>\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.

in the city of Dushanbe.  He is 24 years old, single and lives with his parents.  His mother works as a residential property manager, and his father works as a taxi driver.  Ilhom has a higher education in economics and spent two years working in that field.  Currently, Ilhom provides taxi services and has extensive experience in this field.  Due to current high fuel prices, Ilhom wants to convert his car to run on natural gas.  This is why is requesting a loan from Humo.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

is a hardworking man. He is married and the father of three children. Mehmon is engaged in a farming business. He cultivates potatoes and wheat. Mehmon wants to improve his living conditions and to expand his business. Mehmon would like to get a loan of 5,000 TJS for purchasing mineral fertilizer in order to get a good harvest and to make a good profit. With the profits he hopes to make, he plans to purchase cattle. This loan will be the first loan which he applies to Imon International. \r\n\r\n More about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Buwembo is happily married with 6 kids and he says he began this business with the financial help of a close friend in Mityana town. Before that, he was engaged mostly in farming. He still finds time to do farming as it is a business from which he has been eking out side income. Per week, he says this business churns out 90,000 shillings as income.

He is known as a humble and hardworking father.  Victor lives in his own home with his wife Aquilina, age 42, and their four young children who they protect and care for with much love.  Every day, early in the morning, Victor leaves to work in the fields.  For him, there are no days to rest because he must work continually to care for his crops so that he can have good production.  His main products are potatoes and peas, which he sells in bulk in the city of Tarma.  What he enjoys most about his job is the freedom he experiences working among his crops.  He is able to freely enjoy a stroll through his green fields.  Victor has been farming for 30 years and considers the most difficult part to be protecting his crops from swarms of insects that can affect their growth.  In the future, he wants to buy a car so that he can transport his products to the wholesale market in Tarma.  According to Victor, when prices are the highest, he sells his vegetables in the capital so that he can obtain the most earnings.  His main difficulty has been setting aside enough capital from his earnings to invest in the planting season and in his business.  \r\n<p>\r\nVictor is a member of the Communal Bank \u201cLos Pinos de Antabamba\u201d (The Pines of Antabamba) and will be receiving his sixth loan with MFP.  He hopes that this financial support will help him achieve his goals.  Once again, he promises to complete his repayments on time just as he did with his previous loans.  Victor is pleased to be part of his Communal Bank because all of the members are responsible and supportive individuals.  With this support, Victor will invest the money he requested in the purchase of cattle including bulls and cows.  He plans to take advantage of this season to raise and fatten cattle since there are no crops to harvest.  Victor hopes to resell the cattle at a good price.   \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":793859,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase a bull and a cow.

He lives in his own home with his wife Gisela, age 35, and their five beloved children who he wants to support unconditionally.  Alejandro has been farming from a young age since agriculture is the main business activity in the area.  Throughout this entire time, he has worked hard to become successful with his crops.  Every morning, he wakes up very early to water and look after his crops of potatoes, corn, and carrots.  He sells these products in the city of Tarma because that is where he is able to get the best prices for his crops.  What he enjoys most about his job is enjoying the freedom of working in his green fields.  Alejandro has been farming for 16 years and considers the most difficult part to be working the land every day because he does not have much time to devote to other activities.  However, he makes time to transport his crops from the upper districts, where his farmland is located, to the city so that he can sell them.  Going forward, he wants to prepare his land for planting peas since this crop currently sells the best.  In addition, Alejandro hopes to take advantage of the support he receives from his Communal Bank because he knows that this loan will help him advance and develop his business.  \r\n<p>\r\nHe is a member of the Communal Bank \u201cLos Pinos de Antabamba\u201d (The Pines of Antabamba).

Sandra dreams of all her children continuing their studies and that they will one day be able to study for a professional career. This is why six months ago, Sandra decided to open a business selling snacks out of her home. She used the money from her loan to stock her store and buy various products such as Doritos, tostadas, and sweets. Sandra hopes that with the revenue from her sales, she will be able to invest little by little so that she can start a more established grocery store."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1550,"image":{"id":793873,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","use":"to acquire merchandise to sell through her snack business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Monterrey","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"25.666667 -100.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":18,"posted_date":"2011-06-20T03:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emilia Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Herminia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paula","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sandra Patricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yessica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":18286.44,"loan_amount":1550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1016.66},{"due_date":"2011-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1032.31},{"due_date":"2011-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1048.19},{"due_date":"2011-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1064.37},{"due_date":"2011-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1080.74},{"due_date":"2011-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1097.36},{"due_date":"2011-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1114.23},{"due_date":"2011-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1131.4},{"due_date":"2011-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1148.83},{"due_date":"2011-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1166.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1184.44},{"due_date":"2011-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1202.69},{"due_date":"2011-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1221.19},{"due_date":"2011-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1239.99},{"due_date":"2011-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1259.08},{"due_date":"2011-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1278.46}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.17},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.51},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.84},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.22},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.61},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.01},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.45},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.9},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.37},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.88},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.39},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.95},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.51},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.1},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.72},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":352.74,"local_amount":4161.53,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:52:07Z","rounded_local_amount":4202.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216486264,"comment":null},{"amount":389.11,"local_amount":4590.56,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:38:24Z","rounded_local_amount":4635.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221649325,"comment":null},{"amount":808.15,"local_amount":9534.35,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:49:25Z","rounded_local_amount":9627.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227017121,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-06-20T15:28:42Z","paid_date":"2011-09-15T08:49:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":308224,"name":"Teodocio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Teodocio es costurero; se dedica a confeccionar gorras y sombreros para toda edad las mismas las comercializa en la feria de la calle Tumusla de la ciudad de La Paz.

Selling meat has given Gilda the necessary income to support her family. Her stand is in the N\u00b0 2 Market (and important market in the city of Pucallpa), which is very well visited since the meat that she sells is very fresh and flavorful. This has given her a good reputation and brings her many customers. The thing she most likes about her work is getting to know her customers over the meat that will give all their meals more flavor. She has been in this business for 20 years, and the thing she finds most difficult about it is having to stay at her stand all day without being able to leave. This is, however, part of the sacrifice necessary for making more money. She hopes that in time she will have a bigger butcher shop where she can serve more customers. This will be her fourth loan through Kiva partner MFP, and she hopes for all of your support in realizing her goals. She is a very active and loyal member of her community bank, which is why she is so respected by the other members.

People fish there in the mornings and the reservoir also serves the purpose of supplying water to fields of crops.  They are irrigated fields.  The Limoncito group obtained a loan to invest in their businesses.  There are nine women in the group.  One of them is Maria Rosalba who will invest her loan in buying an overlock sewing machine.  Maria does sewing work with her machine but she has a problem: her current machine is an old model and she needs a more recent one that will help her to make clothes and do better work.  For example, Maria has to deliver some dresses that she promised to make for some young girls so that they can go out to a dance.  She tells us that she knows how to do simpler pieces of work and that was what she always used to do, however, now she has to make dresses which is no easy matter.  This is why she needs a new machine.  She will use her loan to invest in this and continue working.  This is the only way that she has for making money and covering her daily needs.  Maria's goals are to become known for her work and to buy the machine that she would like for carrying out her work.\r\n\r\nMaria is the mother of four children.  Her eldest son is already a grown up and married, the other children are attending elementary school and high school.  Maria is 35 years old and has been married for 22 years.  She lives in her own home and her husband works as a taxi driver.  This is how Maria and her husband make profits for their household and to support their children's education.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the Limoncito group are:\r\n1. Virginia - who has a stall selling sweet treats.\r\n2. Rosa - who has a grocery store.\r\n3. Miryam - who has a school snack bar.\r\n4. Maria Elena - who has a plant business.\r\n5.

She goes out every day seeking customers to sell her novel items to.  She is a very cheerful and convincing seller and always visits her customers with a smile on her lips.  She brings the clothes from the city of Lima and always tries to bring items that are in style.  What she most likes about her work is chatting with her customers.  She\u2019s been in business three years and what\u2019s difficult is transporting the merchandise by bus because the long distance is very tiring.  Even so, she knows that she must put this effort into it if she wants to get ahead.  In the future she\u2019d like to have a large clothing store where she can sell her merchandise more comfortably.\r\n\r\nThis will be her third loan with MFP so she hopes to have all your support in order to reach her goals.  She is very responsible in her communal bank and is always in the know about the agreements reached among the members.

Fredy lives with \u00c1ngela, 26, and they have two children.  They live in their own home made from flimsy materials. \r\n\r\nWith much effort, Fredy managed to turn his fields into green areas surrounded by lush trees and planted with cocoa bean, coffee and citrus fruits.  He\u2019s been doing these chores for the last 10 years with help from day laborers.  He mentions that he learned to till the soil at a very young age thanks to his parents\u2019 teachings.  Today, he works his own lands.\r\n\r\nHis most profitable crop is the citrus fruits because he sells them at wholesale and retail at a very good price.  Thanks to profits earned he succeeded in setting up a grocery store where his wife, \u00c1ngela, works.  The months from June to August are the months when the greatest variety of planting takes place which is why Fredy has called upon the financial institution to negotiate a loan that will make it possible for him to plant more oranges and mandarins.  The plans he has in mind are to continue planting and acquiring more land in order to thus stand out in life.\r\n\r\nThis will be his first loan and he\u2019s very happy to know that he\u2019ll have financial support because he will feel sure of advancing with his planned project.

She enjoys what she does because, thanks to her work, she has acquired several items for her household.\r\n\r\nCarmen is requesting this loan to improve her land and make it more productive.

She lives in a house of her own together with her beloved husband, Javier, 42 years old, and their 3 beloved children. She wants to give them stability for a better future for the family. Celia is an arduous worker, started in the very early morning to prepare breakfast for the members of her family and later she sets out to the fields with her beloved husband. On their land they cultivate cocoa, coffee, and bananas. These are important products that help her to make ends meet and to educate her young children. During the harvest and when the fields need to be weeded she hires farm hands to help them advance faster in their scheduled tasks. She needs the support of the financial entity to help her carry out their scheduled activities. She plans on battling insect plagues that lurk in the fruit buds. She also needs to purchase fertilizers. She does not have sufficient resources which is why she accesses loans from MFP (Kiva Field Partner). This institution helps individuals of limited resources who wish to prosper. For the sake of her businesses, she hopes to have the same strength and impetus for which she is known, to advance production. This will be her second loan with MFP. She hopes to have your collaboration to be able to purchase the necessary products. She is compromised to make her payments according to the payment schedule, and she hopes to access other loans in the future. With the 2000 nuevos soles she requests, she will purchase materials and fertilizers she needs to combat insect plagues that attack the fruit of the cultivations.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":453.87,"image":{"id":794177,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase substances and fertilizers to combat insect plagues.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-06-20T12:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Celia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.77},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140.69},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.78},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":152.93},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.59},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":163.76},{"due_date":"2012-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":166.87},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":182.37},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":186.48},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":194.85},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":198.58}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.22},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.84},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.44},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.76},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.37},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.49},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.55},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.11},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.6},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.63},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.99}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":49.22,"local_amount":135.77,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:13:13Z","rounded_local_amount":135.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221719165,"comment":null},{"amount":51,"local_amount":140.69,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:14:20Z","rounded_local_amount":140.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350628,"comment":null},{"amount":52.84,"local_amount":145.78,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:47:58Z","rounded_local_amount":145.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232851053,"comment":null},{"amount":55.61,"local_amount":153.42,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:56:52Z","rounded_local_amount":153.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238666221,"comment":null},{"amount":120.1,"local_amount":331.32,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:42:16Z","rounded_local_amount":331.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621359,"comment":null},{"amount":57.89,"local_amount":159.69,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:19:02Z","rounded_local_amount":159.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245261,"comment":null},{"amount":67.21,"local_amount":185.41,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:31:51Z","rounded_local_amount":185.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263385371,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-06-20T14:26:38Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":308359,"name":"Maura Elizabeth","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Maura Elizabeth de treinta y dos a\u00f1os de edad vive junto a su compa\u00f1ero de vida y sus tres hijos en casa propia.

mejor educaci\u00f3n. Los campos de cultivo que con tanto esfuerzo ha conseguido Evaristo, son el principal sustento que tiene su familia, sus productos son muy solicitados en la ciudad de San Francisco, ya que la cosecha de cacao, caf\u00e9, ra\u00edces de barbasco y palillos son de muy buena calidad y por lo cual sus productos son vendidos a muy buenos precios.

Lleva 15 a\u00f1os realizando esta actividad y considera que lo m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil es transportar los sacos llenos de frutos, ya que son muy pesados y le quitan mucha energ\u00eda.

He is a cheerful and hard-working man who lives in his own home together with his wife, 43 year-old Graciela.  They have three children from their relationship who they would like to provide with a better education. \r\n\r\nThe farmland that Evaristo managed to acquire through a lot of effort, is his main source of support for his family.  His produce is very much in demand in the city of San Francisco since his cacao, coffee, barbasco and turmeric root harvests are very good quality.  As a result, they fetch a very good price.\r\n\r\nWhat Evaristo most enjoys about his work is protecting his crops from the pest infestations which damage his plants and, consequently, affect his profits.  He has been in this business for 15 years and he considers the most difficult part of his work to be transporting his sacks full of fruit since they are very heavy and sap his energy. \r\n\r\nEvaristo needs this loan to buy sacks of manure so that he can improve his land and later harvest plenty of good-quality fruit.  In order to improve his income, Evaristo is about to buy a plot of land.

They all belong to the Cerro Navia community in the city of Santiago.  Noem\u00ed, who appears at the back of the group in the photo, uses glasses and has short hair.  She has dedicated herself to making furniture for the past 1 year and 8 months, approximately.  Her customers are primarily established shops.  Some of them order furniture upon request.\r\n\r\nShe buys her merchandise on a weekly basis, as she sells very quickly.  For this reason, she needs to supply herself with materials and furniture.  One of her children accompanies her to buy varnish, screws and veneer.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Noem\u00ed\u2019s business is the means of financial support for the family.  Since her husband passed away, she has needed to be in charge of these tasks.\r\n\r\nWith the loan, she will buy sheets of veneer, solvent, dye, cola, glass, mirrors, hinges and wheels.  In addition, she must pay for the manual labor in order to make the furniture.  Her goal is to buy a truck to transfer her furniture to the points of sale.  Currently, she uses her van and her son is who drives the vehicle.  However, it is very small for all her merchandise as Noem\u00ed plans to expand her business to other regions of the country.\r\n\r\nNoem\u00ed shared her knowledge in this arena with her sister-in-law, and things have also gone well for her.\r\n\r\nShe lives with her two children, who are 45 and 42 years old.  They both help her in the business, which has been a great assistance.  Noem\u00ed is very happy and thankful for the help provided by Fondo Esperanza;  the other members are also grateful as it has allowed them to invest in their businesses.  The interpersonal relationships within the group are very good, as they all support each other and collaborate together.  With respect to the training, they have been able to incorporate what they\u2019ve learned into their businesses.\r\n\r\nCerro Navia is a community on the western side of the metropolitan region (where Santiago, the capital of Chile, is located).

They live together in their own home, in the town of San Antonio, which is located in the beautiful jungle of Ayacucho.\r\n\r\nMercedes stresses that everything that she obtains is through tenacity and the dedication she puts into caring for her cacao, coffee and sesame crops.  She tries to provide the best possible care for her plantations and, under that premise, many of her customers are satisfied with the quality of her produce but she still puts as much care and attention into her work as she possibly can.  She spends a lot of time working on her crops, with her partner's help.  However, at harvest time, she needs the help of laborers who can make it easier to harvest the final product.  As a result of her daily efforts, Mercedes is making a good income.\r\n\r\nMercedes will use the loan she has requested to buy more cacao plants since she plans to graft them as they develop.

During harvest time, Pelayo has the support of his son and the laborers who take charge of harvesting and transporting his crops a certain way so that they can then be transported further by beasts of burden such as donkeys.  Pelayo feels very committed to his work because, thanks to his daily efforts, he is now able to enjoy seeing how productive his plants are and he manages to make good profits.  He tells us that he doesn't like winter because it is during these months that there are most insects which damage his crops.\r\n\r\nPelayo will use his loan to buy seeds for timber-producing trees to sow around his plot of land.  Later, he will sow pasture since he plans to start raising a variety of livestock.\r\n\r\nThis is Pelayo's first loan from MFP.  He hopes for a small loan so that he can reach his goals and, for his part, he is ready to make his loan repayments on time.  He will use the 3,000 Peruvian soles he has requested to buy seeds for timber-producing trees such as mahogany, 'tornillo' (Cedrelinga Catenaeformis), cedar, etc."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":781.53,"image":{"id":794193,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

She is married and has two infant-aged children.  To make a living, Thu owns & operates a business manufacturing & selling wood products to local businesses and community members.  Thu has been engaged in this business for over three years and earns approximately 2,500,000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Thu joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Thu has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6,944,000 VND from SEDA.  This previous loan was used to purchase raw materials to manufacture additional products.  Thu is now requesting a new loan of 8,288,000 VND to purchase materials and auxiliary materials to expand the supply of furniture such as desk chairs. The loan will be the second loan taken out by the borrower from SEDA.  Thu plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout SEDA:\r\n\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to the low income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the Northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n\r\nThu N.

She is married to Henry, an auto welder, and mother to their children. She, together with her husband and children, manage their own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nRosemarie operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Rosemarie earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 280 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a Php 12,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nRosemarie hopes to be able to expand soon and succeed in her business.

She is married to Victor and the mother of seven children.  Two of her children are  working, one is in high school, and the rest are working with her in her food stall. She, together with her husband and children, manage their own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nMaura operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings where all of the family members are at home to take part of the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands cost less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  Aside from the food stall, she has an apartment for rent. Maura also earns income by selling Liquefied Petroleum Gas. Her stall is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 1133 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a Php 15,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products such as meat, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings and an additional gas stove for her food stall. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMaura hopes to be able to expand soon,  just as she hopes to support her children's schooling up to college level, and to pay her house in full.

Anarkan has devoted her entire life to raising her kids and being a good housewife. However, the situation changed three years ago when she lost her husband who was the only breadwinner in the family. Since Anarkan had never worked before, she faced the challenge of finding a job to make a living. After long and thorough thoughts, Anarkan decided to sell her apartment and invest the revenue in the purchase of a smaller place to live and in opening a cattle-breeding business. The start-up capital was 30,000 soms and her monthly income is 2,000 soms. Anarkan believes in the further potential of cattle breeding and wants to broaden the business by purchasing two heads of cattle for fattening and reselling. \r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\n This loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\n MBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

It wasn\u2019t hard to decide what activity it would be: like any resident of Tup village, Gulkair could become a farmer. Ten years ago, Gulkair started cultivating her small but rich piece of land. The fertilizers, fuel, and seeds required the initial capital of 16 500 soms. Gulkair is still cultivating land every spring and gathering rich crops in the fall. This time she plans to plant more vegetables; therefore, she needs more fertilizers. It is with this purpose that she addresses the Kiva lenders. She hopes her efforts will be rewarded with rich harvest.\r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\n This loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\n MBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

She is married and the mother of five children: three daughters and two sons, the youngest of whom lives together with Khalila and helps her with her work.\r\n\r\nKhalila was born in an ordinary engineer\u2019s family with seven children. She was a middle child and spent a lot of time on household tasks. Her older sisters got married early, and she needed to take care of her younger sisters and brothers. After finishing high school, Khalila was admitted to a degree program in accounting at junior college, which is where she met her future husband. She got married at the age of 19. The spouses first lived in communal housing since Khalila\u2019s husband also comes from a large family, and the newlyweds did not have a home of their own. Two years later their first child was born. Khalila found a job with the local produce distribution society, where she would remain working  for 12 years. A year later she gave birth to her second child, a daughter. In 1986 and 1987, two more daughters came into the world. In 1993, due to economic difficulties,  the family moved to the village of Panfilovka (the district of Chuisk).  Two years into their life in Panfilovka, Khalla gave birth to another son. Khalila and her husband found work at the local collective farm and were allotted a land plot, on which they eventually had a house built. When the collective farm ceased functioning, they started working as farmers on leased land. In 1999, Khalila and her husband found jobs with the Roadway Management Office  #42: she is a senior specialist, and he as a driver. In 2010, they bought a house in the village of Voznesenovka (the district of Chuisk).\r\n\r\nWith time, their three daughters got married and settled independently. Because this, Khalila had to buy part of her cattel. At present, Khalila and her husband still work for Roadway Management Office  #42 and also raise cattle and grow crops on the land they lease. At present Khalila has one cow and one heifer. In order to obtain more cattle, Khalila approached Bai Tushum and Partners with a request of a loan of 50,000 KGS.\r\nShe plans to use the resulting income to cover the costs of her son\u2019s education and to expand her business further.\r\n\r\nThe microfinance institution Bai Tushum & Partners offers loans to socially vulnerable populations through Kiva. Bai Tushum & Partners ia a leading microfainance organization in Kyrgyzstan. Bai Tushum & Partners is a reliable financial partner which contributes to the economic growth of the Republic ofKyrgyzstan by providing affordable microfinance services in rural areas as well as in cities, thus helping  create jobs and serving the interests of its clients of investors.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":562.5,"image":{"id":794551,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Voznesenovka","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2011-06-19T05:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Khalila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2012-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":562.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":562.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:30:24Z","rounded_local_amount":25462.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250722445,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-06-19T21:04:27Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":308549,"name":"Rodovico","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rodovico is married with five children.
