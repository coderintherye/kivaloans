She lives in her own house with her youngest daughter, Liz, who is 26 and the reason for all her hard work. When she was very young she learned to work in the fields with her parents, who taught her what has to be done to have a good crop. Now she has her own land which she plants and takes care of with much love and patience. She plants peas, spinach and carrots which she sells in the wholesale market of Tarma. What she liks the most about her job is harvesting her crops, since she feels that her hard work is producing. She has spent 40 years doing this activity and she thinks that the hardest thing is protecting her crops from insects that can affect them. With the strenghth that characterizes her, she works alone in her fields, and she learned how to get ahead on her own. She does hire workers to help her with the harvest.

He acquired a lot of experience over the years, above all in growing techniques.  He applies all the knowledge he has gained to his coffee, banana, hybrid corn and cassava crops.  Right now, he is establishing some coffee nurseries.  This will enable him to renovate his plantations quickly with the goal of obtaining better-quality crops.  Yulbe is one of the best coffee producers in his town.  He is well known for his work and wholesale purchasers are always visiting his land in order to negotiate for his produce.\r\n\r\nWhat Yulbe most enjoys about his work is spending most of his time out in the fields.  In the future, he is thinking of buying more land so that he can expand his crop growing and produce on a larger scale.  He is grateful for the work of his community bank because, without their support, he would not be able to grow a larger quantity of better-quality crops.  He belongs to the \"Hormiguitas de Pumpuriani\" (Little Ants of Pumpuriani) community bank and this is his sixth loan from MFP.  He hopes to receive a small loan so that he can reach his goals.  For his part, he pledges once again to make his repayments on time as he has done with his previous loans.\r\n\r\nYulbe enjoys being a member of his community bank because all the members are responsible people who are very supportive of each other.  With your support, Yulbe will invest the money he has requested in buying several sacks of organic manure to spread amongst his banana crops that he planted recently."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":806513,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy sacks of organic manure","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-07-11T17:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yulbe ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":750,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:42:13Z","rounded_local_amount":2059.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621410,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-07-11T23:23:15Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T10:42:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":314084,"name":"Severiano Jose","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Severiano de 42 a\u00f1os, habita en Chacaraseca una peque\u00f1a comunidad ubicada en Le\u00f3n, es padre de tres hijos, el es agricultor, con estudios b\u00e1sicos solo termino el cuarto grado de primaria.

She also sells bananas, papayas and other Filipino fruit staples. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php 600  every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continued business operations, she is requesting a Php 50,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of fruit to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nMa. Ligaya dreams to be able to give her all her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work in her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and to also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Due to financial constraints, Perveen could not provide education for her children. Her eldest son has a construction supplies business, two are daily wage laborers while the youngest son is 17 years old and stays at home. \r\n<br>Perveen's husband has an animal sales business. He buys young animals, raises them up and then sells them to butchers for a profit. His sales increase around Eid (a Muslim festival) because people slaughter animals. At other times he sells them to butchers.   \r\n<br>Perveen has applied for a loan from Kiva partner, Asasah, to help her husband in his business.

Way back in the past, he noticed Janysh\u2019s tendency to manage things well. He suggested that she rent a small local cafe and start operating it. Janysh supports his ambitions and therefore applied for a loan from Kiva.

Cattle breeding is not Muyassarkhan's only activity; she has also graduated with a degree in medicine and has been working in this sphere for almost two decades. Since the monthly income of medical personnel is only 7,000 soms, Muyassarkhan attempted to find an additional source of income. She invested 5,000 soms of family savings to purchase her very first heads of cattle. She did her best to promote the business and soon, thanks to generated profits, she managed to make repairs to her house and expand her herd. Cattle breeding and resale take much time and energy and brings 4,000 soms monthly.

She is a very loving  and hard-working mother, who lives in her own house with her husband Fortunato, who is 64 years old, and their 3 children who are very dear to them.\r\n\r\nMarcela feels very proud and satisfied. Working arduously, she has been able to advance her crops.  She gets  up very early every morning to irrigate and care for each of her potato, spinach, and pea plants. She will sell the harvest in the city of Tarma, since there she receives the best prices for her produce.\r\n\r\nMarcela also raises sheep, cows, pigs, and other livestock. After raising and fattening them, she sells them for the best price, earning a net of 80 new sols for each one.\r\n\r\nWhat Marcela likes best about her work is that she can work in the fields. She has been doing this for 37 years. What she finds most difficult is to plow the land. In time, she hopes to obtain more animals, to be able to dedicate most of her time to livestock raising, since it generates more income.\r\n\r\nMarcela belongs to  the \u201cVirgen Maria\u201d (Virgin Mary) Communal Bank and this is her 2nd loan through MFP. She hopes to continue her collaboration so she can pursue her objectives. She is committed once again to making her payments, as she has with previous loans.  Also, she enjoys being part of her communal bank because all the members are responsible persons with much solidarity.\r\n\r\nWith her new loan, Marcela will buy various head of cattle for her business, plus she will relocate and repair the door to her house.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":806904,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

He lives together with Norma, who has been his wife for 20 years. Together they have 5 children, but they live with only 3 of them in a rented house. His life is an example of progress; when he was very young, he started his path in agriculture working as a laborer on various farms. In this way, he saved up the money he needed to begin planting, and now he works on rented agricultural lands. He knows that he still has a long way to go to buy his own farm, but this does not discourage him. He continuously plants 5 hectares of land, where he sows seeds for spinach, carrots and other vegetables. He has 10 years of experience in this field, and what he enjoys most is seeing how his crops grow day by day. He also mentions that in the heaviest harvest times, he contracts laborers so that they can help him finish the harvest, and then he travels to the city of Lima where he sells his produce. Farming is going very well for him, since he has lands near the river, so that he can plant in any season of the year. For this reason, he is planning to buy a car so that he can transport his harvest. He belongs to the \u201cVirgen Mar\u00eda\u201d communal bank, and this is his first loan with MFP. He is looking forward to this collaboration so that he can continue working toward his objectives. Upon receiving this support, Rolando will invest the funds he is requesting in buying 3 bags of pea seeds for the next planting.

Como buena mujer del campo, desde ni\u00f1a aprendi\u00f3 a cuidar y producir la tierra. Desde entonces  con mucho esfuerzo ha logrado trabajar sus tierras y volverlas muy productivas. Ella cultiva papa, zanahoria, espinaca y arveja, las cuales luego de brindarles el cuidado necesario lleva a vender hasta el mercado mayorista de la ciudad de Tarma, donde las vende al por mayor. Sus cultivos le han dado los ingresos necesarios para mantener a su familia, es por eso que desea poner todas sus ganas en sacar adelante este negocio. Lo que m\u00e1s le gusta de su trabajo es cuidar sus cultivos. Lleva 20 a\u00f1os realizando esta actividad y considera que lo m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil es transportar sus productos desde el campo a la ciudad.

She is known as a simple and hard-working woman.  She is a single mother and lives in a rented house with her four beloved children.  As a good country woman, she learned as a child to care for and tend the land.  Since then, with a lot of effort, she has worked her land and made it very productive.  She grows potatoes, carrots, spinach, and peas.  After she gives them the necessary care, she sells her crops in the wholesale market in the city of Tarma.  \r\n\r\nHer crops have given her the income necessary to provide for her family, so she wants to put all of her effort into improving her business.  The thing she likes best about her work is caring for her crops.  She has been doing this work for 20 years and she thinks the most difficult part is transporting her crops from the countryside to the city.  In addition to selling meat at the wholesale market in the city of Tarma, she also raises pigs and sheep, which she fattens to later sell her meat two or three times a week.  \r\n\r\nNow she is preparing for the spinach and pea harvest, where she is sure to earn a good profit.  In the future, she wants to purchase new land to expand her production.  \r\n\r\nShe is a member of the Virgen Mar\u00eda community bank, and this is her ninth loan with MFP.  She hopes that a small loan will allow her to meet her goals.  She promises once again to make her payments on time, as she has done with her past loans.  She is thankful to be a part of her community bank because all of the members are responsible and supportive people.  Isidora will invest her loan in the purchase of pigs, whose price is about 400 soles each, and if she has money left, she will purchase spinach seeds for her next crop.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":806919,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase pigs and spinach seeds.\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-07-11T02:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Isidora ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2011-07-11T07:21:32Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":314297,"name":"Carlos","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Carlos naci\u00f3 en la ciudad de Calca (Cusco, Per\u00fa) y tiene 44 a\u00f1os de edad.

They had four children but only two still live with them: Kevin, 11 and Joel, 3. They live together with much love and affection in their own house.  As a leader of the community, Frida is a determined, hard working woman.  She is in charge of contracting farmland for the community members since the main occupation of the residents is cultivating bananas and coffee.  She\u2019s been growing hybrid corn, bananas and coffee for 13 years now and to maintain the good quality of her products she cares for them constantly because she assures that if she does not weed her plantings they will not grow to be strong and nutritious.  Her care has led to her crops being high quality and the merchants even visit her fields to buy what she\u2019s harvested.  \r\n\r\nHowever, Frida doesn\u2019t just do this.  She also set up a small grocery store where she sells basic need items as well as cold beverages.  The intense heat and the remoteness of the place lead to her earning higher profits.  Because of this, she\u2019d like to later on save money to improve her store and stock it with better beverages.\r\n\r\nShe is a member of the \u201cHormiguitas de Pumpuriani\u201d (Pumpuriani\u2019s Little Ants) communal bank and this is the sixth loan with MFP where she hopes for your collaboration to continue toward her goals.

Ynocente is a potato, spinach and pea farmer.  He heads out to his fields every morning to work the land to insure that it\u2019s fertile and productive.  He and his wife work very hard together because they know that caring for their crops with much dedication will lead to higher income and they will be able to pay for their son\u2019s education which entails quite a few expenses.\r\n\r\nWhat he most enjoys about his work is keeping his crops free of insect infestations that can affect them.  He\u2019s been in this line of work for 32 years and considers the most difficult part having to transport his products all the way to the Tarma market which is where he sells his crops.  He plans to harvest spinach in a few days and sell it for a good market price.  Ynocente\u2019s ambition is to own a business of his own so that his wife can stay home and care for the children.\r\n\r\nHe\u2019s a member of the \u201cVirgen Mar\u00eda\u201d (Virgin Mary) communal bank and this is the 6th loan with MFP where he hopes to get a small loan to help him meet his objectives.

They have five children, but only two are living with them in their rental house.  The store that Olinda established was the first in her town.  It opens at 6 in the morning to receive the first early shoppers, who know there is always a variety of merchandise to buy and they will find what they are looking for.  \r\n\r\nWhat she likes most about her work is talking to the customers and learning about what goes on in her town.  She has been in this business for three years and feels that the most difficult part of her job is staying in the store all day without being able to leave.  But she knows that her greatest pastime is agriculture.  She has three patches of farmland that she inherited through her husband.  She grows corn and peas two times a years and obtains a good crop because of her hard work.  \r\n\r\nIn the future she would like to grow her business and give her customers better service.  She belongs to the communal bank \"Victoria\" and this is her second loan through MFP.  She is grateful for the financial support she needs and is committed to paying it back on time, as she did with the other one.  Being part of the communal bank is important to her because all the members are responsible and supportive.  Olinda plans to use the loan to buy more goods for her store, especially the ones in more demand this month.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":806983,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy products for her store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-07-11T09:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Olinda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":200,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:49:54Z","rounded_local_amount":549.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250835477,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-07-11T15:05:49Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T10:49:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":314315,"name":"Teresa De Los Angeles","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Teresa, de35 a\u00f1os de edad, esta casada, madre de hijos de 18 y 12 a\u00f1os de edad respectivamente, ella es originaria de Le\u00f3n, ella es comerciante, se dedica a hacer recargas de minutos a tel\u00e9fonos celulares, llamadas nacionales e internacionales lleva 4 a\u00f1os en este negocio.

There she formed a family six months ago with Roel, who cares for their two children: Briceyda, 6, and Sebastian, 1, for whom they want to provide the best lifestyle in their own home.  Aurora works hard for her family to get ahead.  This is all thanks to the support of her husband who divides his time between work and family activities.  Aurora tends to their crops, which only a year ago she planted: spinach, lettuce and peas.  Every morning she gets up early to water and care for the crops.  She takes them to the wholesale market in the city of Tarma where they are quickly sold.  She is also known as a guinea pig merchant, and raises them in her house.  Her husband is a public transportation driver and covers the route between Tarma and Palca, earning extra income for the household expenses.  \r\n\r\nWhat Aurora likes most about her work is the freedom to work in her fields. In the future she would like to fully develop her activities.  She is a member of the communal bank \"Victoria\" and this is her second loan through MFP, where she is counting on you for support so she can continue with her goals.  She is committed to paying back the loan on time, as with the previous one.  She enjoys being part of the bank because all the members are responsible and supportive.  She plans to use the loan to buy 20 guinea pigs so she can intensify her work raising these animals.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":807020,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To

She has 3 children and together they live in their own home. She has had a brick and shingle factory for the past 6 years. It is a business that she has on rented land. She always makes sure to have clay-rich soil, the basic material used in the making of bricks, and to supply herself with other essential materials, such as sand and sawdust. She always works all day long to increase production. The best and most profitable season is the summer, and winter, on the other hand, is not. All of her family participates in the business and they also hire help to keep strengthening the production of their family business. She considers her business to be profitable and she likes the work, despite it being so labor intensive. It generates enough income to improve her finances. She has plans to increase the size of her factory to increase production. She has been with MFP (Kiva Field Partner) for many years in a group setting. She remembers the moment when she was invited by a neighbor to join the group and participate in the group loan. Their group has diminished in the number of members but the group remains strong and trustworthy.

His mixed farm produces milk, eggs and maize which are all sold at the local market. He earns additional income from his motorcycle transport business in the same region. He is age 36 and married with four children who all attend school.\r\n\r\nFrancis has made his third loan request through Juhudi Kilimo for 60,000 Kenyan shillings.

has a mixed farm in the outskirts of Kitale town in western Kenya that is currently producing maize and beans. He has been in the farming business for four years now and employs two farmhands. He earns additional income from his butchery shop, and is also managing his own pool and video center.\r\n\r\nSimon has made his third loan request of 60,000 Kenyan shillings in order to purchase chicken and chicken feeds. The proceeds from this loan will help improve his family's living standards. He faces the challenge of a lack of enough capital to expand his farming activities, and this has made him not be able to enjoy the economies of scale. He plans to expand his poultry farm in the near future in order to start selling his poultry products on a large scale.\r\n\r\nSimon is aged 26 and married with two children, one of whom is currently attending school.

He also makes original wall designs and modern ones on the inside of the buildings. With his business income, he is hardly able to satisfy his family needs. So, today he is requesting to borrow $1,200 from Kiva partner Ameen s.a.l. to buy additional tools and products for his work. He will also purchase wood to further expand his business and be able to earn superior income. In the future, he looks forward to working on bigger projects in his community."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":807377,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction","sector":"Construction","use":"to buy additional tools and wood ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"LB","country":"Lebanon","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"33.833333 35.833333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":115,"posted_date":"2011-07-09T21:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mohamad ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2012-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2012-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":200,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:20:05Z","rounded_local_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":226979136,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:15:21Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232738645,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:17:28Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238543324,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:11:22Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244503014,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:14:42Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250710767,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:25:57Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257113796,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:23:53Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263239051,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-08-01T05:12:39Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":314458,"name":"Cecelia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Cecelia is 64 years old and married.

He hopes that this loan will enable him to acquire a high-quality dairy cow that will produce enough milk for domestic consumption and sale. The proceeds from the sale of milk will help him improve his family's livelihood and expand his farming activities.\r\n\r\nHis major challenge has been diseases and lack of enough capital to expand his farm.

The group members sell products such as cereals (this is the case for Baya who is standing on the far left of the photo with a plastic bowl of rice in her hand), bed sheets, fruits (bananas and mangos) and firewood.\r\n\r\nAs they need to increase their working capital, the group members have joined Soro Yiriwaso's loan program and are on their seventh solidarity loan.\r\n\r\nBaya is renowned in Hamdallaye for the sale of her high quality cereals at the Ch\u00e2teau market in S\u00e9gou. She is planning to use her loan to buy three sacks of rice from the Niono fairpeople at S\u00e9gou's Grand Market. She resells the rice for cash and on credit from her home and at the Ch\u00e2teau market to a customer base made up of men and women.\r\n\r\nWith this loan Baya is hoping to make an average monthly profit of 25,000FCFA, which will be used to reinvest in her business and to provide for small household necessities. Her ambition is through this relationship with Soro Yiriwaso to become a wholesaler.

They are on average 46 years old with four children each. They all live in the Hamdallaye area in Segou (Mali's fourth administrative region), and they got to know each other through their for-profit activities at the 'Chateau de Segou' market. The group members trade in various items: clothes (wax-style and brocade fabrics), fruits (bananas and mangoes), groundnuts and firewood.\r\nNeeding to increase their working capital, the group members decided to partner with Soro Yiriwaso and are on their eight solidarity loan.\r\nOumou, the second woman from the right in the picture, wearing a black scarf, sells groundnuts year round in the Hamdallaye area and in the 'Chateau de Segou' market.

She retails to a mixed-gender clientele from her home, door-to-door and in the 'Chateau de Segou' market, and accepts cash or credit.\r\nWith this loan, Oumou hopes to make an average monthly profit of 15,000 CFA, which will be used to reinvest in her activity and to pay for her children's healthcare."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":807429,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","use":"to buy groundnuts.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Segou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14 -6","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kadiatou                       ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Assetou                      ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paye                     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Oumou                  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":200000,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":150,"local_amount":66666.66,"processed_date":"2011-08-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T10:19:36Z","rounded_local_amount":68071.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227120283,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2011-09-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T10:13:19Z","rounded_local_amount":34035.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232882116,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2011-10-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T11:23:06Z","rounded_local_amount":34035.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238699212,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2011-11-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T11:12:19Z","rounded_local_amount":34035.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244655477,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":33333.35,"processed_date":"2011-12-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T11:22:45Z","rounded_local_amount":34035.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250874273,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-08-02T03:37:19Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T11:22:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":314500,"name":"Razia's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Razia is 47 years of age and married with five children.
