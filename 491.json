Por otro lado, cuando es temporada de alg\u00fan evento o fiesta que se celebra en la ciudad, ella aprovecha para vender algunos productos; es el caso del mes morado, en donde vendi\u00f3 turrones, postre lime\u00f1o, que por medio de pedidos pudo obtener ganancias extras.

She lives in her in-laws' home, along with her husband and three children. Every day, she goes up and down the streets in her district with her catalog in hand, peddling an array of beauty products. Also, when it's the season for a holiday or festival that her city celebrates, she takes advantage of the time to sell some products; this is the case for Mes Morado (Purple Month), when she sold nougat candies, a dessert from Lima, and through these sales was able to get extra revenue. She is a very convincing saleswoman and is motivated by the fact that everything she sells leaves her, which forces her to supply herself with more products. She feels her business is very profitable, and thanks to that she is able to help her husband cover household expenses, besides, she counts on her in-laws' support for caring for her son. It is because of this confidence that she works hard and is motivated to succeed, always giving her customers friendly service. In time, she hopes to sell clothes or have a store for dress clothes.

He is married and has 8 children whose ages he does not remember; all the children go to school.  Carlos only finished second grade and did not continue because he had to help graze the family's cattle.  He lives in his own house with his family and supports his second wife, who lives in Gaza Province, by sending her some money for household expenses. \r\n\r\nCarlos left Gaza to move to Maputo looking for work, and he came alone.  He has worked for more than four years at an agricultural company as an agricultural operator.  He receives a salary of 1,690 meticais per month, which he uses for household expenses.  With the help of his wife, who runs a business, he is also able to save some money through Xitique (a traditional system of rotating savings).\r\n\r\nHe has never had loans from other banks.  Carlos learned about Hluvuku through co-workers who are also customers of this institution.  This is his first loan.  He is asking for 10,000 meticais to buy construction materials (cement, sand, stone, iron, and other items) to continue construction on his house.\r\n\r\nHis greatest dream is to finish building his house.  Carlos is confident he will pay off the loan ahead of time and ask for another

mixteco, significa; \u201ccerro de agua\u201d (yucu nduta\u201d). La lengua mixteca es hablada por todas las personas que  habitan en este pueblo; donde la magia de la naturaleza y el colorido tradicional de costumbres, se mezclan en un raudal de tradiciones, San Miguel Tetepelcingo, se encuentra ubicado a 45 minutos al sur-oeste de Pinotepa Nacional y se caracteriza por sus telares artesanales, el numero de personas que integran el grupo es de 12, que en su mayor\u00eda son artesanas y  su representante se llama Demetria Hern\u00e1ndez L.. \nEn esta ocasi\u00f3n  hablaremos de la se\u00f1ora, Gloria Hern\u00e1ndez Nicol\u00e1s, que tiene 31 a\u00f1os de edad, es casada y su esposo se llama Francisco y tiene 32 a\u00f1os de edad quien es campesino de toda la vida y cultiva ma\u00edz, fr\u00edjol, calabazas y chile, do\u00f1a Gloria es madre de 4 hijos que son: Edith de 15 a\u00f1os, que estudia la secundaria, Ricardo de 12, Francisco de 10 y Juan Carlos de 9 a\u00f1os de edad, estos tres \u00faltimos estudian la primaria.\nGloria es artesana desde los 11 a\u00f1os de edad, su trabajo es la elaboraci\u00f3n  de servilletas para las tortillas, manteles, fundas para las almohadas y telares para vestir, todo esto es elaborado por una t\u00e9cnica muy antigua denominada telar de cintura que en mixteco se dice \u201csahcma-tavi\u201d es una t\u00e9cnica muy original y rigurosa, ya que se cuida el origen de los hilos hasta la creaci\u00f3n de las prendas, todo esto es un legado que data de tiempos muy remotos.\n Gloria solicit\u00f3 su cr\u00e9dito en Fundacion Realidad para la compra de mas material para la elaboraci\u00f3n de sus textiles, mismas que son; hilos de algod\u00f3n para telar de color blanco, azul, p\u00farpura, rojo, amarillo, verde, naranja, caf\u00e9, estos colores de hilos son fundamentales y caracter\u00edsticos de sus prendas, as\u00ed tambi\u00e9n ella pudo renovar algunos instrumentos de trabajo como son bastidores y rempujadotes, instrumentos que se fabrican a mano. Nos comenta que sus artesan\u00edas las elabora en su casa y despu\u00e9s las distribuye en los alrededores de pinotepa y jamiltepec, y muchas veces es muy dif\u00edcil el traslado ya que en temporadas de lluvia hay cortes de carretera o deslaves de los cerros.

The Mixtec language is spoken by all the people who inhabit this village where the magic of nature and their colorful traditional customs mix together in abundance. San Miguel Tetepelcingo is located 45 minutes to the southwest of the town of Pinotepa Nacional and is characterized by its handcrafted weaving. There are twelve persons who make up the group, most of them craftswomen, and their representative is Demetria Hern\u00e1ndez L.. \r\n\r\nOn this occasion we will speak with Gloria Hern\u00e1ndez Nicol\u00e1s. She is 31 years of age and married to Francisco, 32, a lifelong farmer who cultivates corn, beans, squash and chile. Gloria is mother to four children who are: Edith, 15, who is in middle school, and Ricardo, 12, Franciso, 10, and Juan Carlos, 9, all three of whom attend elementary school. Gloria is a craftswoman since the age of eleven. Her work is the making of tortilla cloths, tablecloths, pillow cases and handwoven clothing, all of it created using an age-old technique called \u201ctelar de cintura\u201d [waist weaving] which is called \u201csahcma-tavi\u201d in Mixtec. It is a highly original and demanding technique since the origin of the threads is maintained up through the creation of the finished article. The entire process is a legacy dating back to the very distant past. \r\n\r\nGloria requested her loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad for the purchase of more material for making her textiles, as follows: cotton yarn for weaving, in white, blue, purple, red, yellow, green, orange, and brown. These colors are fundamental and characteristic of her work. She was also able to update certain tools such as frames and large pushers which are made by hand. She tells us that she does her handiwork at home and then distributes it in the areas surrounding Pinotepa and Jamiltepec. The journey is often quite difficult since during the rainy season there are road blockages or landslides. She says her mother taught her this profession and it is the only means by which the women in the area may feel useful. She still remembers that special moment when she made her first woven cloth and saw that the product of her hands has a use in the home, on a table since the napkins are for covering the corn tortillas. \r\n\r\nGloria\u2019s great dream is to promote her handicraft in national and international markets, as in this way, work would be guaranteed to all the producers in this village area. She would like to create a cooperative society in which their products are met with appreciation. She also aspires to raise production, sell more in order to invest, and increase the number of special orders. She would like to improve her living quarters and offer a better education to her children so that some day they may aspire to something more. \r\n\r\nMost of the group members are craftswomen and very dedicated to their profession. They are very responsible persons and when it comes to following through they always do. The women share the requisite trust and a spirit of mutual support. They help each other in everything and are very well-mannered. \r\n\r\nOn behalf of all those who make up this group, she thanks the foundation and those who in every way contribute to this project, a project which improves lives and stokes the dreams of the most vulnerable among us. She tells us \u201cThe essence of the human being is the ability to help others\u201d. \r\n\r\nThe names of the Tetepelcingo group members and their businesses are:\r\n\r\nEmilia Mariana Nicol\u00e1s. \u2013 Weaver \r\nReina R.

She manufactures seasonal and made-to-order clothing.  For example, for the country\u2019s national feast days (in the month of September) she makes traditional costumes.  She also makes graduation dresses, household items (sheets, drapes) and now she is making t-shirts for a high school.  She has been in this line of work for about 3 years.  She used to be a vegetable merchant but when her daughter, who is now 2 years old, was born she left that business.\r\n\r\nShe will use this loan to buy fabric to make tablecloths with Christmas designs and t-shirts.  Some of the money will be used to pay to have some embroidery done on some of the items.  As a matter of fact, she has noticed the need to embroider her items so her short-term goal is to buy an embroidering machine. Her dream is to have a sewing workshop where she can employ others and to have her own home for which she still lacks a little money.\r\n\r\nSupport from Fondo Esperanza has been a great support for Martha\u2019s business.

The union has designated stops and routes for each of its members in different parts of Ivirgarzama where people request transportation services.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is the first loan Nicol\u00e1s has obtained from CIDRE and he will use the funds to purchase a new motorcycle.  He has already completed a work cycle and can now improve service to his customers.  This will allow him to earn more income and improve his quality of life.\r\n<p>\r\nIt should be noted that Sr. Nicolas C. V. showed up to apply for a loan after his co-workers informed him about the good credit terms that CIDRE offers."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":636113,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle

She lives in her own home with her husband and two children.  For the past twelve years, she has been selling trinkets.  She also makes and sells rosaries and crucifix charms to sell to churches and at commercial stores in the central market.  In the beginning Martha produced her own woven chains, pearl necklaces, and rosary charms.  However, the work was tedious and she sometimes did not have enough supplies to complete her orders.  Then she contracted the work of producing chains and pearl necklaces to her friends and neighbors and has done very well since then.  Now she is able to complete all of the orders that are submitted to her.  For this reason, Martha is very pleased with the work she has accomplished and wants to improve her sales methods.  All of her products are contained in a catalog from which she offers every type of rosary.  What she enjoys most about her job is that it is profitable and allows her to pay her four workers.  In the future, Martha has plans to expand her market so that she can earn more and finish the construction of her house.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is her first loan with MFP.  Martha knows that this loan will be beneficial to increase her operating capital, so she promises to submit all of her payments on time.

She also sets apart an amount to make her loan payments on time. \r\n\r\nWhat she wishes for is to have stable work, to be able to support her children while they are in school and to help them achieve a career and to see them become independent. She wants to live comfortable in her home where she can spend the days that God grants her. \r\n\r\nShe became part of the group following and invitation from her neighbors, asking her to complete the group and access a loan.

It is located in the state of Mexico and has 11 members.  One of the members is Mrs Yuriana A. R. who is 29 years old.  She has been married to Mr Fidel A. Medina, an agricultural worker, for 5 years.  Her husband grows and sells corn.  She has a small fruit and vegetable store and tells us that she decided to set up her business because her husband's income often didn't manage to cover their needs and those of their two children.  When she started in her business she sold in the street from a very small stall and kept her merchandise in her apartment.  She only sold beans and corn since her husband is an agricultural worker and the corn was from his harvests.  After a while, she also began to sell peas and, little by little, her business started to prosper.  She managed to rent premises and began to sell more vegetables.  She would like to use her loan to buy fruit and grow her business.  She believes that in this way her income will increase and she will have the opportunity to give her children a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nIn this same group is Mrs Isabel V..  She is 31 years old and has a dressmaking workshop which she has had for 10 years.  She tells us that since she was 11 years old her parents taught her how to sew since sewing is the main economic activity in their region.  She is alone with her three children.  She began her business with one machine and only sold in the small square in her town each week.  She then began to sew sweatshirts and bermuda shorts.  She started selling in more town squares and, even better, she began to sell her garments to order.  She would like this loan to buy a better variety of fabric so that her business can continue to grow.  Her oldest son is barely 14 years old yet he already dreams of becoming an excellent lawyer."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3700,"image":{"id":636170,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"To invest in

This group is composed of 4 members who all know each other and are neighbors. Gabriela A. Garc\u00e9s is a member of the group. She is 39-years-old and lives in a common law marriage. Her husband works in the fields. She completed her studies up until the 3rd year of secondary school and she has her secondary school certificate. She has two sons named Cesar (15-years-old and in secondary school) and Miguel \u00c1ngel (8-years-old and in 2nd grade). She has requested a loan to buy fertilizer to grow corn as well as to plant corn. On the weekends, she sells corn, chicarrones [pork rinds], and chicken feet.\r\n\r\nShe buys her merchandise in the Cuautla supply center and in the main squares of Tlayecac and Yautepec. She began this business 9 years ago. She did not know how to do anything but necessity made her work and since none of her neighbors were selling, she decided to sell corn and chicharrones. In the beginning she sold very little, but now people buy more from her. The majority of people in the town plant corn and although her sales decrease on the weekends during corn harvest season, she sells corn in the town centers. Her business is located in her home in San Andr\u00e9s Cuauhtempan, Tlayacapan. She considers this business important because each week it helps her with family expenses such as food and milk as well as school expenses for her children. She is not lacking the most necessary items. The most gratifying thing for her is serving her customers because it distracts her. When she's not selling, she feels sad. Her customers are her neighbors and residents of other neighboring communities that come to buy her corn. She uses her business earnings to buy school materials and uniforms for her sons. With her earnings, she improves the quality of the food that she gives to her family.\r\n\r\nGabriela is planning to expand her business, since she would like to sell sweets and cakes, and wants to open a location in a room that she plans to set up, with a door that opens out to the street. She wants to put up a ceiling and set everything up so that it's an attractive place. She plans to achieve this with the loans since she pays them little by little. This business has helped her family in the past and it continues to help them. She does not plan to stop and wants to continue saving for when she is older. \"Children live their lives and do not take care of their parents once they're grown,\" Gabriela tells us.\r\n\r\nShe is very happy with this loan because they approved her. She wants her sons to pursue their careers or technical vocations. San Andr\u00e9s Cuauhtempan, Tlayacapan is a town with a cold climate. They are still planting and there is a festival in San Andr\u00e9s on November 30th. All the families make food and expect visits from people who come from other towns. The members of this group are: Rogelia M. R. (who is going to buy fertilizer with her loan to plant nopal), Ana Laura S. D\u00edaz (who is going to buy oil for her equipment), Marisol C. A. (who is going to buy corn to plant and sell it by the ton, etc.), and Gabriela A. Garc\u00e9s (who is going to buy fertilizer and seeds to plant corn). The group members would like to tell Kiva and Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad \u201cto continue supporting us with more loans in order to improve our businesses and sowing season.\""}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":636068,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchase of fertilizer to grow corn","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Tlayacapan, estado de Morelos","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2010-11-11T08:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rogelia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Laura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marisol","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gabriela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-10-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":12000,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2011-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2011-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2011-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2011-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":437.5,"local_amount":5250,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:16:05Z","rounded_local_amount":5346.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182555004,"comment":null},{"amount":250,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:17:38Z","rounded_local_amount":3055.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188691495,"comment":null},{"amount":312.5,"local_amount":3750,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:44:38Z","rounded_local_amount":3818.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191430679,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-11-15T17:53:53Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T03:44:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":246158,"name":"Victoria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"VICTORIA TIENE 28 A\u00d1OS, VIVE CON SU ESPOSO, QUIEN ES PILOTO  DE CAMIONETAS TIENEN TRES HIJOS DOS DE ELLOS YA ESTUDIAN.

It is located in the community of Jaloxtoc, Ayala, in the state of Morelos, Mexico.  The group has 5 female members who know each other and are neighbors.  The members of the group are Mrs Juana M. M. who will use her loan to buy pots, pans and jugs to stock her business, Mrs Rocio M. C. who will buy a lamb to increase her small business which she has started, Mrs Mar\u00eda O. M. who will buy men's and women's perfumes and cosmetics to fill her orders, Mrs Juana A. V\u00e1zquez who will buy soft drinks to stock her business and Mrs Paula V. A. who will buy lambs to increase her business.\r\n\r\nMrs Mar\u00eda O. M. is a member of the Las Morenitas group.  She is 37 years old and studied up to the second year of elementary school.  She has her elementary certificate, however, because she finished her studies with INEA (an institution which allows over adults who didn't finish their elementary or secondary school studies to do so).  She is married and her husband works in the fields.  She has 3 daughters, Ang\u00e9lica who is 10 years old, Lizeth who is 8 and Azucena who is 6.  All her daughters are studying at elementary school.  Mar\u00eda has a business selling perfume and cosmetics from Jafra, Fuller and Avon catalogs.  She offers her customers men's and women's perfumes, creams, lipsticks, mascara, make-up, deodorants, etc.  In her business they give her 1 month's credit, her customers order their products, she makes her order and when the products arrive she distributes them to her customers.  The business is in her home in Jaloxtoc and she goes out door to door to offer her merchandise.  She goes out to her neighbors and acquaintances collecting payment and showing her catalogs.  Her business is important because it gives her income and because it is easy to make money.  She feels proud that she sells these products because she knows her customers well and it makes her money.  She requests more products in her orders so that she can have merchandise to offer her customers.  Her customers are women, girls and ladies.  She serves 10 to 45 customers and her business is popular because many people know her.  This business has helped her and her family when her husband doesn't have work and there is no money because she can take her earnings and cover their family's expenses.  The challenge which she faces is that in the month of May sales fall a little.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda would like to improve her kitchen.  She would like to build it from blocks because it is currently made from corrugated sheeting.  Her hopes and dreams are to continue selling, for her business to continue growing and for her daughters to continue studying.  This loan will be invested in her business whose profits will help her daughters to continue with their studies.

He lives in a rented house together with his beloved daughter Karen, 5 years old, the only one he supports, since he is separated from his wife. What he wants most is to be able to provide a good future for his daughter. \r\n\r\nWith great effort, working sometimes almost 18 hours per day, Efra\u00edn has succeeded in giving his young child the education that she deserves. In his electronics shop he repairs all types of items, but he is known in the town as a specialist in fixing refrigeration devices. Whether it be a refrigerator, a freezer or a cold store, with the astuteness and the experience that his years provide him, they are like new when he is done. What he likes most about his work is to fix refrigeration devices. Because of the intense heat in this part of the country, the people depend on these devices greatly. \r\n\r\nHe has been in this line of work for 25 years and he considers the most difficult part of the job to be obtaining the replacement parts that are needed. Over time he would like to expand his workshop so that he can attend to more clients at the same time. This is his seventh loan with MFP, and he knows that this investment will be very beneficial in the development of his work. \r\n\r\nIn his communal bank he is a very responsible member and very respected. With the three thousand soles he is asking for, he will buy more replacement parts, which he will have sent from the city of Lima. With these, he hopes to be able to better fix the devices. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":636250,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Electronics Repair","sector":"Services","use":"To buy replacement parts to fix refrigeration devices.

G. is a married woman who lives in Purok Alugbati, Brgy. Palaka Sur, Pulupandan, Negros Occidental.  She earns her living by operating three business ventures:  general store, recycling materials and pig fattening businesses.  Her husband Rolando G., who is 50 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have five children who are 11 to 30 years old. \r\n\r\nMercy joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 20 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Mercy  has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 8,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, thus lifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 21st cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000 which she intends to use to buy stocks for the general store and rice to sell so that she could continue to save up for the future education of her children.  Mercy  G. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

S. is a 55-year old widow who supports her family by operating 2 business ventures: ambulant vending of household products and a chainsaw business. She lives in Purok Naga, Benicuil, Kabankalan City, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2003 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. \r\n\r\nBy working hard in her ambulant vending of household products and chainsaw businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 10,000. Bella is now borrowing PHP 17,000 so that she could purchase more stocks to sell. This will be her 15th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom. Bella aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the  Dungganon way.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maricris J. is from the village of Looc Libertad, Sapang, Dalaga, Mis. Occ. She is 25 years old. Maricris is the group leader of a 4-member group loan offered by GDMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is 'Luxurious 1'.\r\n\r\nMaricris is married and has 2 school-aged children. To make a living, Maricris owns & operates a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling seafood products  including fish and shrimp in the local community. Maricris has been engaged in her business for over 8 years and earns approximately 2000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Maricris joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Maricris is requesting a new loan of 4000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the first loan taken out by Maricris from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental.

She had already provided her children with a good education and had bought a house. She hopes to save some money for arranging a wedding for her son and becoming a grandmother. The main purpose of the loan is to buy sheep for diversifying her livestock business.\r\n\r\nAbdimakhamad M., 21, is a resident of Tokmok. He has been involved in construction of apartments and houses for two years. The purpose of the loan is to buy construction materials and equipment for finishing up his house. \r\n\r\nElvira D., 27, is a baker in Tokmok. Her dream is to open a chain of her own bakeries throughout the whole country. She hopes this loan will help her to make this dream come true. She will spend her profits on purchasing furniture.\r\n\r\nMarina D., 30, works as a packager in a bakery.

D. is a 61-year-old single mother with four children. Three of her children live on their own. She and her daughter and granddaughter live together in a ger, a traditional Mongolian nomadic housing tent, in the Baganuur, one of the remote districts of Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. Her daughter works as a teacher in the school and her granddaughter attends a secondary school. Dechmaa operates a dairy products business in the local community. She started her business in 1996 operating a small shop where she sold a variety of foodstuffs and dairy products. After she closed her shop, she decorated an extra room of apartment where she started to operate her dairy trading business.

Wilma and her husband have six school-aged children. \r\n \r\nIn 2007, Wilma joined ASKI to gain access to financial services. Her goal was to help improve her living situation and increase her ability to engage in business activities. Wilma has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase materials needed to provide services. Wilma is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will also be used to purchase necessary materials. This loan will be the eighth loan taken out by Wilma from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the central and northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk, and small business entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

is a young woman from Jabalia Refugee Camp. She is married and a mother of three daughters and two sons. Her husband Kamal owns a small sheep farm on which he raises sheep for sale.\n\nZareife came to FATEN and took a loan because her husband needs to increase the number of sheep he raises since Al Adha feast is around the corner and demand is increasing.  Zarefei's husband will use the loan for this purpose which will increase their income and improve the family's situation.\n\nZarefie's husband Kamal appears in the picture here as Zareife, like all Gazans, is very religious and is not comfortable having her picture online.\n\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\n \nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan. For more information on lending in the Muslim world, please visit Kiva's Muslim World Lending helptext:

It has been a long road to recovery since the damaging disaster. After finally building her business to what it once was, the oil spill has affected Mary\u2019s Floor World as well. People are not investing in their homes, corporations are hiring other large companies to renovate commercially instead of hiring small businesses, and many locals are without jobs. Small businesses in her city are struggling but with the new mayor and police chief\u2019s dedication to recovery, Mary is incredibly hopeful that New Orleans will return to the city it once was. \r\n\r\nMary says, \u201cSince Katrina and the recent oil spill, everything has been chaos.\u201d She took out her first loan earlier this year with ACCION Texas-Louisiana to finance a major job. \u201cNormally, I would have never needed to go to anyone to finance a job, but I need funds and the bank rejected my loan application.\u201d She paid back the loan within 30 days after the job was completed. This large contract was crucial to her success because with the profit she made from that job, she has been able to finance smaller contracts. With this recent loan, she will finally have the means to do the necessary repairs and renovations to her office that will communicate to the public her business\u2019s full recovery from the hurricane and the oil spill. \r\n\r\nMary is hopeful that the city of New Orleans will get back on its feet again and that the local businesses will thrive. Her advice to small business owners is, \u201cIf you really want your business to succeed, you have to hang in there no matter how bad it is. Sometimes, it gets pretty tough. You just cannot give up.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":6150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3347.2,"image":{"id":636688,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction","sector":"Construction","use":"Renovating

The other women are also members of the group \"Mujeres Exitosas\" which translates to \"Successful Women\". They are pictured at Gloria's house. \r\n\r\nGloria is a hardworking and active woman. The members of the group chose the name \"Successful Women\" for their group because they want to be successful at everything that they do. Gloria is the leader of the group. She lives in San Juan Tuxtepec in neighborhood 1 which belongs to the municipality Chapa de Mota in the state of Mexico. \r\n\r\nGloria is 30 years old, is married and is the mother of 3 boys. Her first son is named Sergio de Jesus and is 12 years old. The second is named Luis Angel and is 10 years old and the third is named Jose Julian and is seven years old.  Gloria's husband is named Juan de Jesus. He is 36 years old and is an assistant mason. Her husband sometimes has to work in Mexico City for one to two months at a time without seeing his family. \r\n\r\nGloria is a homemaker but also works in embroidery and sells her napkins to people in the community. On market days she has a stall where she shows her embroidery. The images she embroiders range from animals such as deer, geese and others to all types of flowers. The napkins Gloria embroiders are labor intensive. She has to sit for hours to embroider. Generally, it takes Gloria two days to embroider a small napkin and it takes two weeks for large items such as covers and blankets. It is difficult on occasions to find someone to purchase her embroidery. In her area people do not pay much for something that is so labor intensive. Gloria looks for people from other states or countries that admire her work and pay well. \r\n\r\nGloria has dedicated herself to embroidery since she was a child. It was passed down in her family from women like her mother and grandmother. She has years of experience in this field.  Embroidery is something that can eventually pay well and be a successful business. She needs help to take her embroidery to places where people from other places can see her embroidery and pay well for it. \r\n\r\nGloria's community has few resources and the majority of people live humbly and raise animals such as sheep and cattle or grow corn. Currently, few women know how to embroider and sell embroidery. \r\n\r\nThe following women are the members of Gloria's group: Carlota P. F. who is 63 years old; Beatriz Adriana G. M. who is 34 years old; Ana Karen Perez V. who is 19 years old; Araceli Felilpa R. T. who is 26 years old; Claudia Raquel A. B. who is 34 years old; Sara F. Asunsion who is 45 years old; Gloria A. B. who is 30 years old; Liliana S. H. who is 22 yearls old and Lilia R. Desidero who is 30 years old. \r\n\r\nThis is Gloria's group of successful women and it is a group of women that is united and that help each other. They get along well and have known each other for many years. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3600,"image":{"id":636165,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","use":"Purchase thread in various colors and napkins to embroider.

In addition, his wife has a grocery store, which helps bring in income for the family.  \r\n\r\nWhat Fredy likes best about his work is planting his fields, which he does with great care.  He works twelve months a year and considers the hardest part to be protecting his crops from any pests that might affect them; he never forgets to spray his fields.  In the future he would like to purchase additional fields to plant.  \r\n\r\nThis will be Fredy's second loan with MFP. He doesn't want to fail to make payments for lack of money, so he is already saving up.  He's one of the few men at his village bank, so he always tries to be responsible and respectful toward the other members.  He will invest the two thousand soles he is seeking in the purchase of cacao and coffee seeds to increase production.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":636870,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy cacao and coffee seeds.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-11-10T18:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fredy ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-10-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":725,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:33:27Z","rounded_local_amount":2025.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206195703,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-11-11T01:38:54Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T11:33:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":246462,"name":"Pelagia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Pelagia  es socia del  Banco Comunal \u201cSan Salvador\u201d, ubicado en el distrito D.

The group's name is in the Mixtecan language and means \u201cThe stream (river) of the grandparents\u201d.  'YUTA' means 'stream (river)' and 'CHI' means 'grandparent'.  They decided to give the group this name since the town of Yutachi is near the group's meeting point, and also to honor of their ancestors.  There are 11 people in the group, together with their representative who is called Anastacia N. M..\r\n\r\nOn this occasion we will talk about Mrs Esther Leonor Ba\u00f1os J. who is a member of this group.  She is 46 years old and married.  Her husband is called Lorenzo and he is 50 years old.  He works as a belt maker and as an agricultural worker.  They have been married for 22 years and have had 4 children.  Three of their children are still alive.  Josefina(+), who was their third child, died from health complications and lack of specialized medical care.  This was a result of the poverty and inequality of society.  Their remaining children are Alejandro, 21; Felipe, 19 and Joel who is 11 and is pursuing his secondary education.  Esther only studied at elementary level.\r\n\r\nEsther used the loan which they were awarded to acquire material to use for making her hand-made embroideries.  She makes handbags, wallets, blouses, napkins and tablecloths using a number of different stitches such as cross-stitch, 'trenza margarita', 'pato de gallo', rococo, star, chain, the complicated technique of openwork in cross stitch and the embroidery of blouses with seedglass beads.  Among the long list of materials which she uses for this beautiful work are the following: Panama linen, cotton skirting, tergal (a synthetic fibre containing polyester),  hand-spun cotton, different threads such as cotton thread, worsted for embroideries and 'iris vela' thread, all in different colors, stitch unpickers, seedglass beads, embroidery hoops and different sized needles.  She started her business more than four years ago owing to her own need for financial improvement.\r\n\r\nEsther's biggest dream is to gather together a large number of people who live in conditions of extreme poverty, to teach them everything that she knows without distinction of sex or creed.  She would like to promote self employment for the most vulnerable who are women and indigenous people.  Another of her goals is for other people to find out about her crafts and promote them so that she can make more profits and, in this way, help her project grow as well as provide support for her children's education.\r\n\r\nEsther is currently working hard on training more people to work through a social office called ICAPET as well as the governmental program for indigenous people called CDI.  This shows that despite the great inequality of society, there are still people who dream, who are doing something and that their great commitment is their love towards other people.\r\n\r\nShe tells us to speak with these words, \u201cI am grateful to Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad for trusting in the poor, for helping to free us from these chains which bind us called poverty and for believing in an abandoned sector of society who nobody turns to see.  Thank you for everything and God bless you forever\u201d.\r\n\r\nThe following is a list of the members of this group and their business activities:\r\n\r\nSalustia T.

To make a living, Jovelyn owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector running a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food & daily use products in the local community. Jovelyn has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 5500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Jovelyn joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Jovelyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Jovelyn is requesting a new loan of 13000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the 11th loan taken out by Jovelyn from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of the children. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Magdalina has been engaged in her business for over fifteen years and earns approximately $200 a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Magdalina joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future. \r\n\r\nMagdalina is requesting a new loan of 6,000 PHP which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This will be her 3rd loan from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

To make a living, Rosalina owns and operates a general store, selling food and daily use products in the local community. Rosalina has been engaged in her business for more than three years and earns approximately 3500 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Rosalina joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her business and living situation. Rosalina has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. For her portion of the group loan, Rosalina is requesting 8000 PHP, which she will use to purchase additional inventory and for working capital. This will be the second loan taken by Rosalina from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the loan to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

The official name of this borrowing group is Virginia T. group.\r\n\r\nVirginia is married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Virginia owns and operates a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Virginia has been engaged in her business for more than 15 years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Virginia joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Virginia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Virginia is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Virginia from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She has been in this line of work for more than three years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Sharol joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her life and ability to engage in business. She has successfully repaid six previous loans from ASKI and is applying for a new one, for 12,000 PHP, to buy additional supplies and items to sell to her customers. She plans to use the additional revenue generated by her business to supplement her family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fishermen and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

is treasurer of a group of small businesspeople called the Rise Group, which is funded by Juhudi Kilimo. She is a farmer from the town of Nyamira in western Kenya, where she has worked as a farmer for the last seven years. She grows maize, beans, vegetables, tea and milk, all of which she sells locally. She depends on the income from her farm to meet the needs of her family.\r\n\r\nShe has applied for a loan for 45,000 KES through Juhudi to buy and insure a dairy cow. The extra income from this loan will help her pay school fees for her children and improve her family's living standards.

To make a living, she owns a business raising and selling tilapia (St. Peter's fish) to the market. Gemma has been engaged in her business for over 15 years and earns approximately 3000 PHP a month. \r\n\r\nIn 2007, Gemma joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7000 PHP from ASKI and is requesting a new loan of 7000 PHP to purchase fish to sell. This loan will be the eighth loan taken out by Gemma from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI: ASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

He explains that herders drive herds anywhere from 100-200 km to sell their livestock in the capital city of the province. In Mongolia, it is common for a household to buy at least one cow and ten sheep to be eaten during the long Mongolian winters. People of this province usually prepare their meats for winter in October and November and finish those prepared meats in March. As a result, Erjan plans to sell his products during the spring season. He usually purchases livestock from herders and slaughters the livestock to sell at the local market. His wife is responsible for selling the meats at the market. He sells lamb for 2,000-2,500 MNT per kilogram and horse meat for 3,000-3,500 MNT per kilogram.

To make a living, Roger owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector running a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food & daily use products in the local community. Roger has been engaged in his business for over 4 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP monthly for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Roger joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Roger has successfully repaid a previous loan of 9000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Roger is requesting a new loan of 12000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. This loan will be the 6th loan taken out by Roger from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

But since her brother passed away she was unable to travel to the countryside, and started a meat retail business. \r\n\r\nHer future plan is to give a good education for her kids and be able to pay university fees until their graduation. From the previous loan she has taken from us she bought a big freezer to store her meat products. This time she is requesting a loan to buy a small family car which will be used to carry her meat products."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1975,"image":{"id":637109,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher Shop","sector":"Food","use":"To buy a
