This calf is now fully grown and has produced a calf of its own.  \r\n<br\/><br\/>\r\nBesides making cheese and selling milk, she has bought 10 baby chicks.

O. P. makes and sells tortillas from her home. She has been making tortillas for four years; before that she used to weave handicraft items. She will use the proceeds of her loan to buy 300 pounds of corn which she requires every week, the firewood to fire the stove, and plastic bags in which to sell the tortillas. She\u2019s a member of the group of women called \u201cCaterina\".\r\n<p>\r\nAs a single 52-year-old woman, she has learned to be resourceful in her life. In 2005, the rains from Hurricane Stan caused her house and everything else she owned to be washed away. Her house slid down the mountainside along with everything she owned except for two of the traditional indigenous huipiles, or local blouses. She decided to sell the shirt off her back in order to start over, and sold one of her two huipiles.  Since then she has built a new house, which shares a patio with her son\u2019s house. As she tells the story of her experience with the hurricane, tears come to her eyes. She says that her health is good, but that since the hurricane she is more nervous and afraid, and that life has not been the same. Although she\u2019s recuperated somewhat from the hurricane, she still doesn\u2019t have much in the way of clothes, and often wears a t-shirt around the home, although she puts on her huipil to go to the market or into the village.\r\n<p>\r\nShe has 7 children. Two of her children and her sister help her with her growing business. \r\n<\/br><\/br>\r\nLike so many indigenous people, Sebastiana is enormously resourceful. She is a local midwife, delivering babies in her village. Some of the parents can pay and some cannot. Those who can, will pay up to 150 quetzals or about US$20 for her services.  In her medical bag are lubricant, prenatal vitamins, metal pans, and a few bandages. Currently, she is in need of gloves to wear during the delivery. When asked where she learned the art of midwifery, she replied in Cakchiquel, that although she has never gone to school and never learned to read or write, she has just always known how to do this."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":50210,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"She

His stock of about Kshs 25,000\/- consists of goods ranging from house hold to farm products. He started it early last year and has been going home with a profit of Kshs 300\/- to Kshs 400\/- at the end of the day. He usually gets his stock twice a week from bungoma. In terms of clientel, Aloys mostly serves residents of Chwele centre and its environs and majorly travelers because Chwele is located on one of the main roads to Kitale.\r\nWith a young business, he

A new law will soon prohibit the importation and sale of used clothing which means Jhanina urgently needs to liquidate her inventory.  She needs capital to rent a stall in the market and hire people in order to speed up sales.  In the meantime, Jhanina will be searching for a new line of business with which to support her family.   <p> <b> Translated by a Kiva volunteer. <\/b> <p>\r\n\r\nJhanina L.

Today, she is a proprietor of a big grocery store where she commercializes all kinds of products of basic necessities, such as oil, noodles, canned products, candies, soap, etc.\r\nMirta works everyday from 6 a.m. to 7 p.m. She tells us that her goal is to go so far as to buy her own house, since where she lives now it is a rented house. To increase her profits she wants to sell wholesale products since in the area where she is, there are many wholesale clients. For this reason she needs a loan of $600 that she will use to buy wholesale basic products such as oil, flour and sugar.\r\nWith this Mirta will obtain bigger profits that will allow her to save more and buy one day the house that she desires so much.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by Ana Gabriela Clark, Kiva Volunteer. <\/b><p>\r\n\r\n<p>La se\u00f1ora Mirta L.

Today, he has his own fast-food stand where he sells empanadas, sandwiches, rosquillas (a traditional pastry), and soft drinks.  He\u2019s managed to develop a well established set of customers, working mostly with street vendors who come to buy his food very early in the morning and then sell it on the streets of the city.\r\n<p>\r\nThe food stand is very successful and is now the largest in the area.  Furthermore, it is across from a bus stop and, consequently, the majority of its customers are people waiting for buses.  He\u2019s been operating this business for 5 years now, working with his mother who he helps to make the food.\r\n<p>\r\nDiego hopes to keep on expanding his business; to do so, he needs to buy supplies of basic foodstuffs--the most important of which are meat, eggs, flour and soft drinks\u2014at wholesale prices and delivered to his door, so that he can save the time and effort that he now expends everyday to go to the market for supplies. \r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nDiego C.

They have a son and a daughter who are both in high school. They have contracted for this farm since January 2007 and have invested a lot of money in it. Every day she and her husband look after 800 ducks including egg-laying ducks and ducks for food, 25 pigs and a fish pond and a rice field of one hectare. However, she is still full of energy and plans. So she wants to borrow $1,200.00 to build a biogas plant ($430.00) to keep the environment clean and make the most of livestock manure. She will also use the loan to buy 25 breeding pigs and 800 chickens and ducks. As for payment, she is very confident and proud because she gets $6.5 per day from selling eggs, not to mention regular incomes from other livestocks. She says she doesn't fear hardship, she just dreams of having enough money to send her children to university."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":50822,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"She

At this point in time, he and his soon-to-be wife began living together in his parent's house. She worked at one of the firms in the city of Maputo. However, since her salary was low, she decided to start selling clothes in the province of Inhambane. This business did not survive due to the difficulty in traveling to the province. <p> Some months later, they decided to open a grocery store, having secured a stand and placing it beside their residence. The business prospered, and they were able to save some money. In May of 2007 they married, and the expenses far surpassed the money that Sauban had saved for the event. This forced him to use his savings from his business. Through a friend, he became acquainted with Hluvuku and asked for a loan of 600 dollars to purchase merchandise to increase his stock. This business greatly affects his family. By increasing the rent, he is able to cover his expenses, and now, he is renovating his house.

She is 42 years old and married with 2 children. She lived with her parents in Beira until she was 12 years old. She completed the 5th grade in the 1970s. After the 1975 Independence, she returned to Maputo and lived in Machava for 3 months, and afterwards, her parents bought a house in the city of Matola. There she took some courses in embroidery and sewing. After her marriage, her husband worked at Nacala-Porto for 4 years. She worked at a restaurant in the hotel from which they rented making sweet and savory snacks. Later she divorced, and since she was unemployed, she started living with her parents in Matola. Her sister, who lived in the city of Maputo, had a kitchen where she made custard and coconut cakes and delicacies and sold them to Polana gas stations. She would be payed weekly, and thus she began to gain customers and many requests for aniversary cakes, buffets, and decorative work. Shell contacts her for lunches and event planning. Since her sister had a shortage of financial resources, she hired Bernardete. <p> She worked 9 years as a caterer for her brother-in-law until 2002. However, since her way of life did not improve, she decided to leave her job and form a partnership with a South African couple in a restaurant in Matola for 8 months. At the end of 2003, she leaves the partnership and rents a bar in Matola for some time and then buys an oven to produce arrufadas (a type of cake), which she distributes at schools. <p>She meets her husband in 2004, and he works at a food supply for the workers of Mozal. This is when they decided to build a kitchen in the garden of their house, producing sweet and savory snacks. Bernadete met Hluvuku through friends and asked for a loan of 1,200 dollars to increase the volume of stock. She employs 3 workers, one female, and contributes to the reduction of unemployment and poverty. <p> Her business greatly impacts the community by reducing the travel time for the delivery of pastry items. She also acts as an alternative to her customers, especially institutions and other organizations, when they host seminars, conferences, etc. In the future, she would like to own a van to transport product for distribution to her customers. She would also like to have her own lodgings, employ more people, and increase her business while also maintaining and improving the quality of her products.<p> <b>Translated from Portuguese by Marco Alves, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nBernardete Margarida Dhorsam, nasceu em Maputo tem 42 anos de idade, casada maritalmente, tem 2 filhos e viveu com os pais na Beira at\u00e9 aos 12 anos onde concluiu a 5\u00aa classe na d\u00e9cada 70.\r\nAp\u00f3s a Independ\u00eancia em 1975 volta a Maputo e passou viver na Machava uns 3 meses e depois os pais compraram uma resid\u00eancia na Cidade de Matola e fez alguns cursos de estilismo, bordados, corte e costura.\r\nDepois de casada o marido teve emprego em Nacala-Porto durante 4 anos e no Hotel onde alugavam havia um restaurante e ela dedicava suas energias no fabrico de doces e salgados e mais tarde divorcia-se passando a viver com os Pais na Matola e como era desempregada, a irm\u00e3 que vivia na cidade de Maputo dispensa uma cozinha para confeccionar bolos de nata e coco, del\u00edcias e os entregava nas Bombas do Polana. e estes pagavam semanalmente, assim come\u00e7ou a ganhar clientes e as pessoas contactavam-na para encomendas (Bolos de anivers\u00e1rios, montagem  Buffet volante e trabalhos de decora\u00e7\u00e3o) que lhes valeu muita clientela. A Shell contacta para fornecer lanches e organizar eventos e como tinha escassez de recursos financeiros a irm\u00e3 decide apoi\u00e1-la.<p>Trabalhou durante 9 anos com empregada de Cathering na firma do seu cunhado at\u00e9 2002, e como a vida dela n\u00e3o melhorava decide deixar o emprego e firma uma sociedade com um casal Sul Africano num restaurante na Matola durante 8 meses e nos finais de 2003 deixa de ser s\u00f3cio e aluga um bar ainda na Matola onde explorara por pouco tempo e decide comprar um forno para fabrico de arrufadas que os distribu\u00eda pelas escolas.<p>Conhece seu actual marido em 2004 e este ganha um trabalho fornecimento de comidas aos trabalhadores da empresa Mozal \u00e9 quando decidem montar uma cozinha no quintal de sua resid\u00eancia, por\u00e9m ela n\u00e3o deixou de fazer doces e salgados que os fornecia aos diversos clientes seus. Teve conhecimento da Hluvuku atrav\u00e9s de amigas, tendo se dirigido e solicitar um empr\u00e9stimo de 30.000,00 MT. Com este cr\u00e9dito pretende aumentar o volume dos seus produtos e ter um stock. Emprega actualmente 3 trabalhadores dos quais uma mulher, contribuindo para redu\u00e7\u00e3o da pobreza e desemprego.<p>O impacto da actividade \u00e9 vis\u00edvel pois encurta a distancia para compra de produtos pasteleireiros por encomendas, cria uma alternativa para os clientes sobretudo para as institui\u00e7\u00f5es e outras organiza\u00e7\u00f5es quando tem semin\u00e1rios,

She is a native of Maputo and a daughter of a police officer and a homemaker. She attended school until the 8th grade. She started working at the age of 27. Although due to sickness, she had to abandon her job. Later, her godfather offered her a kiosk, which she left to construct a small commercial establishment near the Ferroviario club in 1986. In 2003, the municipal council destroyed the building. That same year she rented a stand at the People's Market. <p> Through a cousin, Alice came to know Hluvuku-Adsema and asked for a loan of 1,000 dollars to invest in her business. With a previous loan, she was able to improve the conditions of her business, increasing qualitatively and quantitavely the meals she prepares. She has 2 establishments, the second localized in the Maxaquene district. This establishment allows her to work later hours. The establishment located in the People's Market must close by 7pm, the time when she has the most customers. The community is greatly impacted by this business; beyond providing food to local workers, her income allows her to support 5 people and employ two kitchen workers. <p> <b>Translated from Portuguese by Marco Alves, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nAlice \u00c2ngelo Covela, nascida em 26 de Fevereiro de 1959, natural de Maputo, filha de Pai Policia e m\u00e3e domestica, estudou ate oitava classe. Come\u00e7ou a trabalhar aos 27 anos, onde por motivo de doen\u00e7a teve que abandonar o emprego. Mais tarde o seu padrinho ofereceu lhe um quiosque onde come\u00e7ou a praticar a actividade que at\u00e9 agora desenvolve, alienou esse estabelecimento e foi construir um pequeno estabelecimento comercial no recinto do clube Ferrovi\u00e1rio em 1986 onde veio a sair em 2003 com a destrui\u00e7\u00e3o das mesmas pelo conselho Municipal. No mesmo ano ela foi alugar uma banca No Mercado do Povo onde at\u00e9 ent\u00e3o desenvolve a sua actividade.\r\n<p>\r\nPor interm\u00e9dio de uma prima sua e que \u00e9 cliente da Hluvuku-Adsema informou se sobre os requisitos e recorrendo a um empr\u00e9stimo de 15 000,00mt para refor\u00e7ar deste modo o seu negocio.\r\n\r\nCom o empr\u00e9stimo de 25.000,00mt melhorou cada vez mais as condi\u00e7\u00f5es de atra\u00e7ao de clientes no seu estabelecimento tendo aumentado qualitativamente e quantitativamente as refei\u00e7\u00f5es que confeciona.\r\n\r\nConta actulamente com 2 estabelecimentos e que o segundo est\u00e1 localizado no bairro de Maxaquene. Este, permite-lhe trabalhar at\u00e9 mais  tarde j\u00e1 que no Mercado do Povo onde est\u00e1 localizado o 1\u00ba estabelecimento, n\u00e3o \u00e9 permitido trabalhar acima das 19 horas e sendo este, o  momento em que regista maior afluxo de clientes.\r\n\r\nA actividade tem um impacto positivo na comunidade pois para al\u00e9m de fornecer refei\u00e7\u00f5es aos funcion\u00e1rios que trabalham a redor do mercado, com os rendimentos consegue sustentar 5 pessoas que est\u00e3o na sua responsabilidade e dar emprego a duas serventes de cozinha com quem

Life became extremely difficult. At the age of 22, she and her husband moved in together. Since her husband's salary was insufficient, in 1999 she started selling wood. Through a friend, she came to know Hluvuku and asked for a loan of 800 dollars to purchase more wood in order to increase the volume of her sales. <p> This business has made a positive and visible impact on this family. It has allowed them to rent an apartment and purchase a vehicle, which her husband uses for his taxi service. The community has been impacted also by this business, which supplies quality wood for the production of furniture and construction of houses.

It was through her first husband that she came to know Hluvuku, but after his death, she saw no other alternative to maintaining her business without the help of Hluvuku. Her first credit was used to increase the volume of her business with various products, and she payed off the loan without any problems. With the current loan of 400 dollars, she intends to purchase her product in greater quantity and to diversify her business more. <p>This business' impact on the community is a positive one. She reduces the distance required to purchase everyday products in a community that faces a great lack of public transport. She manages her business personally. In her absence, her daughter watches over the business. Her income allows her to support her family and educate her children. She hopes to improve her business by supplying the it with a variety of products for retail or bulk sale. <p> <b>Translated from Portuguese by Marco Alves, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nVit\u00f3ria C. nasceu a 49 anos no distrito de Chibuto-Gaza, vi\u00fava , tem 5 filhos e ainda responsabiliza-se no cuidado de mais 4 criancas que o marido teve com outra mulher, cresceu e viveu com a Av\u00f3, estudou at\u00e9 a 4\u00aa classe mas com muitas dificuldades, isto na decada 60.\r\nAnos mais tarde a av\u00f3 veio a falecer e teve que passar a viver com o tio no Xiquelene arredores da Cidade de Maputo onde conhece o seu marido e mais tarde foi casada tradicionalmente e rumou para viver com ele na Manhica onde ele trabalhava.

A.  is 34 years old and she has a secondary education. She is married and has 3 children.  When Khayrinisso graduated from school, her parents did not allow her to continue her education. She got married and was a housewife and looked after her children. The civil war touched the Khayrinisso family and she was forced to look for a job, but was unsuccessful. <p>After that, Khayrinisso decided to start a business. She started to sell kids' clothes.   When she got a good profit from the business, she started to change the range of goods. Currently she sells kerchiefs and women's underwear as well. It has been10 years since she started selling.

She finishes making the rice pancake at 5.am., then spends her whole morning to deliver the pancakes to the restaurants.  Because her pancakes are good, she often finishes selling everything before noon.  Each pancake brings her a profit of $0.012.  On average, Ms. H. earns $3.5 a day.  This amount is mostly spent for the food and the school bills.

She received her first micro loan more than 10 years ago. It was a very small amount: 25 USD. With that money, she started her business of buying scrap material then resell. Other people in the same business barely make enough money to survive. For them, there is no opportunity for expansion in this kind of business. For Mrs B\u1ea3y it's a different story. With her determination combined with a high degree of organization, she had made her buy\/resell scrap material business into a very viable one. What started out as a small business 10 years ago, buying small quantity of wasted material to resell, is now a well organized and successful one. She now buys her wasted materials in big quantities. These are then categorized and resold to various factories. Mrs B\u1ea3y has 3 children, all grown up and they all work with her.

It's a place of beautiful green hillsides and lush plots of corn and vegetables, all divided into little sections called cuerdas. The poorer women often rent just one cuerda and try to grow their own corn for the family and sell some vegetables from it. Those who have more sometimes own two or more cuerdas, and sometimes rent even more.

C. X., 52, can be found just outside the entrance of the school every  day selling fruits in bag, juices, empanadas and crackers to the school kids.. At the beginning of every day, she puts aside the coin from her first sale of the day to give to the church. She believes it brings her good luck to think of others in need. She also owns 4 little plots of lands and rents 10 more plots of land where she grows vegetables. A plot of land is known in this part of Guatemala as a cuerda and is about one sixth of a football field. She sells the vegetables she grows  in the large market in Quetzaltenango. Cornelia is an ambitious woman. With the next loan she hopes to buy 100 chicks and 3 bulls. She and her husband work hard because they want to be able to leave some land for a house to all of their 5 grown children. Unlike most women of her age in this community, Cornelia actually went to school and finished the third grade, so she can read and write. All of her children also spent at least a few years in school. Cornelia's village is nestled right against the side of the Santa Maria volcano, part of a complex of volcanoes that regularly rumbles tand that completely destroyed the village in the early 20th century. It's a place of beautiful green hillsides and lush plots of corn and vegetables, all divided into little sections called cuerdas. The poorer women often rent just one cuerda and try to grow their own corn for the family and sell some vegetables from it. Those who have more sometimes own two or more cuerdas, and sometimes rent even more. It's hard work, and they always refer to their life as a \"battle\" or \"struggle\", but they continue with the battle to feed their families and keep the kids in school.\r\nWritten by Nancy Lewis and

She does not have her own pasture so she will have to take the bull to various grazing places, like along the side of the road.

It might be a mound of grass in the back of the neighbor's house or along the side of the road or high in the hills. She may tie it up there or may hang out with it all day so the it can eat enough to grow into a full blown bull to sell for the meat: She hopes to sell the bull for up to Q4000 ($525) Maria is a widow and lives with her daughter. She had five children and three lived to adulthood, but two died of a fever that struck the village. She has never had schooling and can not read.\r\nAs you can see in the picture, Maria wears the beautiful traditional Mayan skirt and top called a huipil which identifies what village she comes from.

It's a place of beautiful green hillsides and lush plots of corn and vegetables, all divided into little sections called cuerdas. The poorer women often rent just one cuerda and try to grow their own corn for the family and sell some vegetables from it. Those who have more sometimes own two or more cuerdas, and sometimes rent even more. It's hard work, and they always refer to their life as a \"battle\" or \"struggle\", but they continue with the battle to feed their families and keep the kids in school.\r\nWritten by Nancy Lewis and

When the planting and harvesting seasons are in full swing, she spends almost all her time in her little plot of land, tending her corn and vegetables. But with this loan she will add chickens, turkeys, and a calf to the mix. And during the lulls in the agricultural seasons she also runs a tiny comedor, or eatery, where she serves simple lunches and coffee, hot chocolate, and soft drinks. Micaela is 46 and has seven children, five of whom are currently in school. She herself studied for six years when she was young, and loved it, but had to stop when she got married.  Her husband is currently working far away and hasn't been able to visit for two years, but is not getting enough work and expects to return this year. Micaela's village is nestled right against the side of the Santa Maria volcano, part of a complex of volcanoes that regularly rumbles the area and that completely destroyed the village in the early 20th century. It's a place of beautiful green hillsides and lush plots of corn and vegetables, all divided into little sections called cuerdas. The poorer women often rent just one cuerda and try to grow their own corn for the family and sell some vegetables from it. Those who have more sometimes own two or more cuerdas, and sometimes rent even more. It's hard work, and they always refer to their life as a \"battle\" or \"struggle\", but they continue with the battle to feed their families and keep the kids in school.\r\nWritten by Randy Fay and

She just got it going 8 months ago, and with this loan she'll have a stove to add more to her menu, including garnachas, enchiladas, pupusas (a tortilla with fried pork rind and cheese).  Garnachas are fried wedges of tortillas and topped with refried beans, cheese and chile sauce. Manuela is just 21 years old, but is married with three small children, and has big entrepreneurial ambitions. She's thinking that this year she might be able to open a little eatery in the nearby city of Quetzaltenango, and maybe more in the future. But with her current operation Manuela pays about US$13\/day for food and supplies, and ends up making a profit of about US$6.00\/day.  She pays rent of US$55 per month.

Her little business brings in only a small portion of her income, so she also works extensively in the fields of others to support herself and her 16-year-old. \r\n<br\/><br\/>\r\nPetrono, 32, is separated from her husband and has just the one son, who did complete fourth grade.  Petrono herself never had any schooling, cannot read or write, and speaks only a smattering of Spanish, since day-to-day conversations are carried out in her native Quich\u00e9 language. \r\n<br\/><br\/>\r\nPetrono dreams of somehow prospering in her business, renting larger plots of land, and maybe buying her own land someday. She thinks that next year she may be able to rent two cuerdas of land and double her income.\r\n<br\/><br\/>\r\nWomen's group: \"De la Cruz\" in La Estancia de la Cruz,

In their loan application, the group described their business as follows:<p>\r\n\r\n\u201cBackground:  The 'balayeuses' or sweepers number 65 members and are divided into four smaller groups.  They often suffer from the lack of financial resources.  The sweepers take charge of improving living conditions by regularly sweeping the streets and main boulevard of their neighborhood, because the local government does not provide garbage collection services. With time, this citizen practice of taking responsibility for improving local living conditions has spread like an oil stain to the surrounding localities.<p>\r\n\r\nObjective:  To support these women in their retail trading activities.  <p>\r\n\r\nSpecific objective:  To provide the members of this group with the resources they need to strengthen their trading activities, allowing them to continue their neighborhood cleaning services as well.<p>\r\n\r\nBrief description of the activities to be financed by the loan:  The members of this group engage in retail sale of all types of common consumption items [i.e. food products, clothing, etc.].  With the loan funds, the group will buy such products in bulk and resell them among the members of their association and to other customers, and the profits earned from all these transactions will be used to repay the loan and to reinforce the purchasing power of the group.\u201d <p>\r\n\r\nBackground\r\n<p>\r\nSenegal is one of the world\u2019s poorest countries, yet its solid democratic tradition and highly developed associational life distinguish it from other countries in its income group. Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, known as tontines. Commonly organized by groups of twenty to thirty housewives who live in the same village, the tontines provide poor women throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these associations are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional tontines from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities.

Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, which provide the rural poor throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these groups are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional associations from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities.
