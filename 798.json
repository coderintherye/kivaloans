Daniel is married and the father of two children, aged 1 and 12. He lost an eye in an accident and this enormously hampered his chance of getting a job. This is why he decided to launch his own fast-food business, and thanks to it he is able to generate enough profit to pay for household expenses. Daniel is well known in the area because of his good service. In an effort to increase his sales, he wants to fit out his premises with chairs and tables to make them more attractive to customers.

She has been selling little cheeses from butter and cream since she was 15 years old.  She now has 47 years of experience in this business activity.  She learned this trade when she was with her parents.  She says that this business activity is a family legacy.  She and her sisters do the same thing, and she says that she will always continue doing it as long as God gives her life.  This is the way she gets her family ahead.\r\n\r\nShe does not buy the supplies for her production because her family has always had cows.

Finally, she walks on foot for ten minutes to get to the market.\r\n\r\nThe loan that Deysi is requesting is to buy two cows.  The sales she is making are pretty large, and she only has three dairy cows.  Their milk is insufficient.  With the loan she will increase her milk production, improve her family\u2019s quality of life, and get greater income.  This way she will provide everything that is needed in her house in order to survive.

Olivia sue\u00f1a con que sus 3 hijos tengan una gran calidad de vida y puedan acceder a una educaci\u00f3n de buena calidad.\n","en":"Olivia is very hardworking and continually wishes to provide a better quality of life to her family. Olivia is married with three children. She has always wanted to give her children a high quality education. Since her husband\u2019s income is not enough to cover the household expenses, Olivia decided to set up a store, providing customers with all of the basic household goods. The store has been in operation for a long time, and little by little, it has seen a considerable increase in sales. \r\n\r\nOlivia had the excellent idea to offer home delivery. Thanks to that, her store has grown stronger in her region. Right now, deliveries make up a large portion of the store\u2019s income, and sometimes the deliveries are delayed due to the large number of requests. Olivia wishes to take out a loan to be able to buy a motorcycle. This would allow her to make more deliveries in less time and serve more people. Olivia hopes that with a motorcycle, her store will continue to grow and continue to be recognized in her region, and she will be able to continue increasing sales. Olivia\u2019s dream is to give her three children a good quality of life and a good quality education. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1002895,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"purchase a motorcycle which would allow her to make more deliveries in less time.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"San Rafael","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2012-03-02T02:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-01T02:30:02Z","loan_amount":1250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Olivia Margarita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":2200000,"loan_amount":1250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65396},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67237},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69130},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71076},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73077},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75135},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77250},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79425},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81661},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83960},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86324},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88755},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91253},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93823},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96464},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99180},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101972},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104843},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107795},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110830},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113950},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":117158},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120457},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":123849}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.16},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.2},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.28},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.38},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.52},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.69},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.9},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.12},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.4},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.71},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.04},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.43},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.85},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.31},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.81},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.35},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.94},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.57},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.25},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.97},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.74},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.57},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.44},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-03-25T19:05:58Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":395628,"name":"Paraje Centro 2 Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Rosario es soltera, tiene 31 a\u00f1os de edad, no tuvo la oportunidad de estudiar, se dedica a la crianza de animales, inicio este negocio criando aves dom\u00e9sticos, pollos y hasta el momento lleva 6 a\u00f1os de experiencia.\n\nSolicita un pr\u00e9stamo que lo utilizara para la compra de toro y cerdos, lo cual cuando fueran grandes poder venderlos y mejorar sus ganancia, espera en el futuro contar con una granja.

This town is known for its exquisite shrimps, its clams and the charm of its residents, who always offer their traditional rolls, alfajores and oquendos. It is the world's number one producer of rice by hectare and in large quantities. Among such great production is the Tacuar\u00ed rice, which is the best and most tasty kind of rice. Apart from the best rice, it also has the most tasty beans, and its beaches are the vastest and clearest of the southern area of the country. Experts say that they are the most beautiful beaches in the south, with a lot of potential nationwide. During his free time, Walter enjoys listening to music, especially classical music, because it is very soothing. Besides, being a good Peruvian, he very much likes the typical food, and one of his favorite dishes is the delicious \"lomo saltado\" (stir-fried steak and potatoes).\r\nWith a lot of hard work and most of all with support from his wife, who's his right-hand person, he was able to start his business providing decorations, rental sound equipment and also catering for events. He's very hardworking, but it is mostly his wife who encourages him to keep going in spite of the obstacles he may face. She was also the one who gave him the idea to be in this line of work.

In addition, Gloria hopes that if her business grows, it will generate more income for her so she can improve the quality of life for her children. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1003163,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Recycling","sector":"Services","use":"to buy recycled items to sell them in bulk and generate profits.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Medell\u00edn","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2012-03-02T04:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-01T04:00:04Z","loan_amount":1700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gloria Amparo ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":3000000,"loan_amount":1700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":89197},{"due_date":"2012-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":91707},{"due_date":"2012-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":94287},{"due_date":"2012-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":96940},{"due_date":"2012-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":99667},{"due_date":"2012-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":102471},{"due_date":"2012-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":105355},{"due_date":"2012-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":108319},{"due_date":"2012-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":111366},{"due_date":"2012-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":114500},{"due_date":"2013-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":117721},{"due_date":"2013-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":121033},{"due_date":"2013-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":124438},{"due_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":127939},{"due_date":"2013-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":131539},{"due_date":"2013-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":135240},{"due_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":139045},{"due_date":"2013-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":142957},{"due_date":"2013-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":146979},{"due_date":"2013-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":151114},{"due_date":"2013-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":155366},{"due_date":"2013-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":159737},{"due_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":164231},{"due_date":"2014-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":168852}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.54},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.97},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.43},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.93},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.48},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.07},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.7},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.38},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.11},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.88},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.71},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.59},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.51},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.5},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.54},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.63},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.8},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.01},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.28},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.63},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.05},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.51},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.07},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.68}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-03-04T01:53:57Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":398442,"name":"Ilhomjon","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0418\u043b\u0445\u043e\u043c\u0447\u043e\u043d \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0436\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0432 \u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u0435 \u041f\u044f\u043d\u0434\u0436. \u041e\u043d \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0442. \u0415\u043c\u0443 36 \u043b\u0435\u0442. \u0423 \u043d\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0434\u0432\u043e\u0435 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u041e\u043d \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u043c. \u042d\u0442\u0438\u043c \u0432\u0438\u0434\u043e\u043c \u0434\u0435\u044f\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u043e\u043d \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f 20 \u043b\u0435\u0442. \u041a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0431\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0442 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0435\u0432\u0430 \u043b\u0443\u043a\u0430 \u0438 \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u043e\u0448\u043a\u0438.","en":"Ilhomjon lives in the Pyandj district.

has been an entrepreneur for over seven years.  She sells children's shoes.  Following her husband's death, she was left with four adolescent children, with her oldest daughter being ten years old.  Gulnora started to work as a dishwasher at various cafes and restaurants and earned a miserly salary, which was only enough for food.

She therefore decided to set up a stationery store in her home.  This business makes her the income she needs to support her household.

This has turned her humble stationery store into a 'miscel\u00e1nea' (a small store that carries a wide variety of goods).  As a result, she has gained a large number of customers.  With the aim of continuing to increase the variety of merchandise that she sells in her store, Wilma would like to take out a loan which will allow her to buy costume jewelry, cosmetics and clothing.

He found a friend who taught him how to work in the street selling underwear such as socks, boxer shorts, etc.  Thanks to his good customer service, Wilver has gained a very good customer base.  This allows him to make very good sales.  With the aim of stocking his business, Wilver would like to take out a loan which will allow him to buy underwear such as socks, boxer shorts, etc.  This will enable him to offer his customers a larger variety of products.\r\n\r\nWilver hopes to be able to continue making the income he needs for his household and to offer his wife and daughter a better quality of life.  Wilver dreams of being able to set up his own sales location so that he no longer has to work in the street and no longer has to experience the complications of working on the street."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1005111,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy underwear such as socks, boxer shorts, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Medell\u00edn","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2012-03-02T11:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-01T11:50:02Z","loan_amount":575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Wilver De Jesus ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":71212},{"due_date":"2012-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":73215},{"due_date":"2012-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":75275},{"due_date":"2012-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":77393},{"due_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":79571},{"due_date":"2012-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":81809},{"due_date":"2012-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":84111},{"due_date":"2012-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":86478},{"due_date":"2012-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":88911},{"due_date":"2012-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":91412},{"due_date":"2013-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":93984},{"due_date":"2013-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":96629}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.95},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.1},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.28},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.75},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.04},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.37},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.72},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.13},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.56},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.04},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-03-26T00:21:33Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":391650,"name":"Roberto","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Roberto se ha dedicado desde hace aproximadamente 25 a\u00f1os a la actividad de la fabricaci\u00f3n de calzado.

So, he decided to buy a jeepney (public transport vehicle) to increase his profit. He started to operate his transportation business in the year 1996. His route is from their village to Santiago where his passengers acquire their merchandise and basic necessities. His village is known to be a mountainous place and more focused on agricultural business.\r\n\r\nRobert still wants to gain more income for his children's education. So he also runs a hog-raising business as an additional source of income. Due to his patience in managing all his businesses, he is able to finance his eldest son to pursue his studies. \r\n\r\nRobert said, \"The greatest accomplishment in life is letting children finish their education\".

Even though she already had a job which was supplying her with income for her household, she needed to find a source of extra income to support her children because the salary she was receiving in her other job was not enough to cover all of the expenses. It was for this reason that Marlen started her business selling personal hygiene products from catalogs, which she offers to her friends, neighbors and family. In this way Marlen is able to guarantee higher income for her family, which allows her to provide her children with everything that they need. Thanks to the good service Marlen offers, she has been able to secure good customers, who make good orders. With the desire to respond to an order that was made by a customer, Marlen is requesting a loan that will allow her to buy personal hygiene products like lotion, makeup and creams among other things, to be able to fulfill a large order that was made by a customer.  \r\n\r\nMarlen hopes that as a result she will be able to continue earning the income that she needs to offer her children a higher quality of life and to be able to offer them access to higher quality education. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1006261,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy personal hygiene products like lotions, makeup and creams among other things, to be able to respond to a large order that has been made by a customer.  \r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Sonson","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2012-03-02T16:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-01T16:20:03Z","loan_amount":1250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marlen Yuriana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":2200000,"loan_amount":1250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":65336},{"due_date":"2012-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":67181},{"due_date":"2012-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":69077},{"due_date":"2012-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":71027},{"due_date":"2012-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":73032},{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":75093},{"due_date":"2012-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":77213},{"due_date":"2012-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":79392},{"due_date":"2012-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":81633},{"due_date":"2012-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":83938},{"due_date":"2013-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":86307},{"due_date":"2013-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":88743},{"due_date":"2013-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":91248},{"due_date":"2013-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":93824},{"due_date":"2013-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":96472},{"due_date":"2013-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":99195},{"due_date":"2013-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":101995},{"due_date":"2013-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":104874},{"due_date":"2013-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":107834},{"due_date":"2013-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":110878},{"due_date":"2013-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":114008},{"due_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":117226},{"due_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":120535},{"due_date":"2014-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":123939}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.12},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.17},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.25},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.36},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.49},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.87},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.11},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.38},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.69},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.04},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.43},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.84},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.31},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.81},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.36},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.96},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.58},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.27},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.78},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.6},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.49},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-03-23T03:11:01Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":389853,"name":"Jennifer","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jennifer is 30 years old, married and gifted with three young children.
