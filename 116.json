This is 25-year-old Suzane M., who is married and has two children aged three and seven. In 2007, Suzane established her charcoal business. Working six days a week, eight hours a day, and assisted by her husband, she earns about $30 every month.  She now requests a loan in order to purchase additional stocks of charcoal. In the future, Suzane plans to increase both the quantity and range of the stock.  She thanks you for your support. <P>These small, black, and dirty pieces of dry earth are important not just to charcoal sellers but to their customers, who rely on charcoal to cook their meals. Many Tanzanians still use small coal pots, in which they arrange mkaa (charcoal), and add either paper, dry grass, old plastic bags or kerosene in order to light them. The fire requires constant fanning to ignite and maintain the flame, and makes cooking quite a hot and laborious task. It may not be the easiest or most environmentally friendly form of cooking, but it is the only option many people can afford."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":183563,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fuel\/Firewood","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase additional stocks of charcoal in bulk.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-07-22T22:00:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Suzane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-08-06T00:36:09Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2008-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2008-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2008-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":30000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":28,"local_amount":30545.45,"processed_date":"2008-09-06T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-20T07:26:43Z","rounded_local_amount":32603.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":318233,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":28,"local_amount":30545.45,"processed_date":"2008-10-06T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-18T07:20:06Z","rounded_local_amount":32603.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":350111,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":26.5,"local_amount":28909.1,"processed_date":"2008-11-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T03:31:06Z","rounded_local_amount":30856.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347885,"comment":null},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2008-12-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:07:19Z","rounded_local_amount":32021,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970457,"comment":null},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-01-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:12:19Z","rounded_local_amount":32021,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886674,"comment":null},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-02-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:01:36Z","rounded_local_amount":32021,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20435936,"comment":null},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:54:00Z","rounded_local_amount":32021,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130240,"comment":null},{"amount":27.49,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:22:37Z","rounded_local_amount":32021,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027073,"comment":null},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:12:21Z","rounded_local_amount":32021,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613113,"comment":null},{"amount":27.51,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:00:37Z","rounded_local_amount":32020.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010196,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-07-23T00:36:09Z","paid_date":"2009-07-16T00:00:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":57623,"name":"Samuel Feliciano","description":{"languages":["pt"],"texts":{"pt":"Samuel Feliciano M. is 33 years old, married and the father of 2 children, aged 9 and 5, the eldest of which already goes to school.

In addition to his children he supports his sister, sending her money in Nampula, where she lives.  <p>\r\n\r\nArfino studied through 6th grade and then did not continue because of his family\u2019s financial situation.  In 1984 he enrolled in the military, which was disarmed in 2002.  With his retirement money he decided to open up a small business selling diverse products, a business which he continues to grow today with the help of his girlfriend.  Open 7am to 5pm, the store primarily carries vaseline that sells for 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 meticals.  The main challenge that he cites is the 30-km trip on public transit to transport his goods from the city of Maputo, where he acquires them.  He earns 2100 meticals per month and is not able to save anything.  <p>\r\n\r\nIn January of this year, he was contracted as a security guard at a company called CMC.  He works from 7am to 7am the following day, in 48-hour shifts.

In fact, if you are a regular lender on kiva.org, you may be tired of reading about kuku. Who or what are \u2018kuku\u2019, you may ask. Kuku is Swahili for chickens, and raising them for sale is popular for a number of reasons. <P>Firstly, they require little start-up capital. You can start with one or two, and either add to them as you go, or wait for them to multiple naturally! Secondly, they require little space, so sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. Thirdly, while they are growing they produce eggs, which can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income, or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein. I\u2019m sure there are hundreds of other reasons  raising kuku is so popular (maybe they are friendlier than other animals? Prettier?), but this is all time and space will allow."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":183613,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase additional chicks and feed.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-07-22T11:00:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Frida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-08-05T18:14:07Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2008-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2008-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2008-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":30000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":28,"local_amount":30545.45,"processed_date":"2008-09-05T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-20T07:26:29Z","rounded_local_amount":32603.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":317210,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":28,"local_amount":30545.45,"processed_date":"2008-10-05T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-17T07:21:57Z","rounded_local_amount":32603.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":348961,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":26.5,"local_amount":28909.1,"processed_date":"2008-11-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T03:31:23Z","rounded_local_amount":30856.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347893,"comment":null},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2008-12-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:07:18Z","rounded_local_amount":32021,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970466,"comment":null},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-01-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:12:20Z","rounded_local_amount":32021,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886683,"comment":null},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-02-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:01:37Z","rounded_local_amount":32021,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20435945,"comment":null},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:54:03Z","rounded_local_amount":32021,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130249,"comment":null},{"amount":27.49,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:22:40Z","rounded_local_amount":32021,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027082,"comment":null},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:12:26Z","rounded_local_amount":32021,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613122,"comment":null},{"amount":27.51,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:00:31Z","rounded_local_amount":32020.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010205,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-07-22T18:14:07Z","paid_date":"2009-07-16T00:00:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":57662,"name":"Zena","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mambo from Dar es Salaam, Tanzania!

2000, Mrs. Ngyen T. Giau's husband went to other villages to find jobs.  Since then, he has never come back.  She was left with two young children.  Mrs. Giau became the sole bread winner of the family.  She works any job around the village, and does some tailoring to earn money so that her kids can go to school.  She has two perches of land to plant wheat, but because of her sickness, she has to leave the land unattended.  Last year Mrs. Giau was able to hire someone to work on the land, earning 4,000,000 VND (around 235 USD).  When her husband left the house, her youngest son was very small.  He is now in second grade.  Mrs. Giau's life is still very difficult.

T. H. Oanh's husband passed away after an accident, leaving her with their two young children.  Theif lives were hard; the house was unsettled.  Mrs. Oanh tries very hard to provide her kids with food and education.  At the beginning of 2004, Mrs Oanh remarried and has another child with her second husband.  Her husband's job is to sell sand from the river.  However, this is a seasonal job, which he can only work during the dry season.  During the raining season, he has to do all kinds of jobs.  Mrs. Oanh is doing farming.  However, since the soil is not good, and she cannot employ a lot of technical advances, their family income is still very limited.  Earning money is hard, and keeping peace in the family is not good either (since her sons and her husband do not get along well).  Mrs. Oanh wants to borrow money to raise cows and save money for her children's schooling.  \r\nIn Mrs. Oanh's family, the average monthly income is 190,000 VND ( equivalent to 12 USD) per person.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Vietnamese by Phuong Nguyen, Kiva's Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nN\u0103m 2003 ch\u1ed3ng b\u1ecb tai n\u1ea1n giao th\u00f4ng ch\u1ebft \u0111\u1ec3 l\u1ea1i cho v\u1ee3 2 \u0111\u1ee9a con th\u01a1 v\u00ec th\u1ebf h\u00f2an c\u1ea3nh gia \u0111\u00ecnh r\u01a1i v\u00e0o t\u00fang T.\u1ebfu, nh\u00e0 c\u1eeda ch\u01b0a \u1ed5n \u0111\u1ecbnh.

R. lives in the Gissar district. She is 44 years old and has two school-age children. Mahfirat is divorced, and raises and supports her children by herself. She has a university degree in teaching, and she currently teaches Tajik language in a local school. Since her salary is so small, and isn't even enough to by groceries, she also sells fruits and vegetables. She is currently on vacation and would like to expand the range of produce she offers. The more fresh goods she has, the more business she will have. Doing that, however, will require money, so she decided to take out a loan. She will pay back the loan over ten months. <p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Russian by Anna Brown, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\u0420\u0430\u0431\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430

Her husband has been working for 15 years  in a concrete factory and he earns about 1000 KM (US$ 810) monthly. <P>This is Fatima's first loan at MCO WWI in the amount of 600 KM (US$ 500) and Fatima intends to use this loan to buy a cow because she has all the conditions for cattle breeding. She has a big place that she will set aside for a future barn and she hopes that she will buy a good cow with a lot of milk in order to sell milk and earn additional money for herself and her husband."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":183973,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy a

They have faced this problem for several years, and Waheed was so sad about it and didn\u2019t know how to solve it because he didn\u2019t have much money to purchase an electric water pump. \r\n<p>\r\nWhen one of his friends told him about the AFSG micro finance institute, Waheed became so happy and immediately requested a loan of 30,000 Afghanis. \r\n<p>\r\nWaheed hopes that through this credit, he will be able to purchase a water pump for his lands and stand on his own feet as soon as possible.  He also dreams of a brighter future for his family, especially for his younger brothers.  He thanks lenders in advance who help needy people like him."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":184252,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase

A. lives in the town of Nurek. She has 4 children. Since her children are still very young, she is the single provider for the family.  She has been in the business of cattle farming for the last 25 years. She purchases skinny animals, feeds them for a number of days, and sells them later on. This process is continuous and it brings her profits, which are sufficient for food only.

She enjoys an unparalleled reputation in her area, one of the most populated in the capital of Banimonoti\u00e9 Bougouni. In her search for complementary financial resources, she decided to try the loan program from microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso.

She would like this loan to buy 2 bags of wheat flour, 20 liters of cooking oil, and 2 loads of firewood. She gets her supplies from wholesalers at the big market in Bougouni and cooks in front of her door, located in the Heremakono district. The donuts she makes are sold at a set price in front of her home, and the clientele consists of every social class in the city.

As his business capital is limited, he buys just a few and then after he sells those, he returns to buy more. The frequent trips cause his overhead to be elevated. He would like to minimize his overhead by increasing his capital, so that he can then maximize his profits.
