a divorcee with three children has to work hard to survive. Therefore after being left by her husband who remarried 15 years ago, Salwanah started to open the meatball sales business. With an initial capital of Rp 200,000 (Translator\u2019s note: 1 US$ fluctuates between Rp8,000-9,500.00), Salwanah bought beef, that was then ground at the market's grinder; afterwards the meat was mixed with spices and a little flour, then round rolled to the size of quail's eggs, then cooked in boild water that was already mixed with spices so that it would taste good as soup. It is then served in a bowl mixed with noodles, cabbage,  soy sauce and a little other sauces. From this meatball sales, usually a profit of Rp45,000\/day could be achieved. This profit is used by Salwanah to pay for daily expeneses. The house she lives is inherited from Salwanah parents. For the future, Salwanah likes to expand her business by selling mixed rice and light food, besides selling meatballs, her old business. Therefor Salwanah requested the loan to Dinari Foundation for Rp 500,000.

At his cafe customers can sit with friends, enjoy a good lunch, and drink cold beer and other refreshing drinks. Both businesses are stable and allow him to support his family. Since he invested a large amount of money in the cafe, he came to Microinvest for a loan. With the loan he bought two large bull calves. His family helps raise the animals.

Little work is available in the area where she lives, so with the help of her older sister she decided to start a business. Using her savings and aided by her sister, she rented a small place at the bazar, and started buying and selling children's clothing. What money she made became the only source of income for the family. She lives with her mother-in-law.  The children are growing and she needs to be selling at the bazar every day. She has been involved with Microinvest for over a year. She has been an exemplary client during this time.

They enjoy living in such a town because of its tranquility and low amounts of crime, according to Maria C.. They expressed contentment with their specific loan group because of the support that the women can provide each other in a friendly atmosphere. \r\n\t<P>They are mostly mothers who manage to proudly send their children to school, even while managing and investing in the needs of their micro-enterprises. Seven of the group members are dedicated to hand weaving traditional indigenous clothing, another four, to the resale of imported second hand clothing, and another three to the sale and production of food products. \r\n\t<P>Hand-made guipils traditional top blouses of the high quality that they accustom to sell, usually take one month to produce and sell for amounts between 150 to 220 USD, according to Silvia S.. The resale of clothing is managed by shopping at different used sales stores, finding valuable items, and selling them once more in their town and local, to people interested, hereby gaining a profit. The food producers focus on a series of vegetables, produce and either sell to middlemen or directly at town markets. \r\n\t<P>When asked about how their businesses were going, there was hesitation, but overall, they were content with the rate of growth and income that it had brought them. This was said, despite their recognition that the price of many things has gone up recently and sales drop for the rainy season. \r\n\t<P>Nevertheless, these mothers and businesswomen were proud to have their own business which allowed them a sense of empowerment. With the capability to reinvest their money and return higher profits, this struggle is made easier, according to Rosa M., and their work can carry on while they are \u201csatisfied and tranquil.\u201d\r\n\t<P>Most of the loan that they receive goes to bulk purchasing of the necessary products for their business, be it cloth, threads and dyes for the weavers, or seed, fertilizer and pesticide for the farmers. They continuously need this useful capital to allow them flexibility paying off debts, expanding their business while reinvestment, and living a comfortable life as a family. \r\n\t<P>Karla C. sells \u201cOstra\u201d mushrooms in a home-made wooden house specifically to foster mushroom growth. Her mushrooms are sold in the villages at lower altitudes down by Lake Atitlan. Her business, as well as many others of her group partners, has grown, yet she could still use this loan to make it grow even further. She said she would invest the money from loans in building a large greenhouse to produce much more mushrooms at once. Ingrid D. said she would remodel her local store with loan money to attract more customers. \r\n\t<P>Their dreams with ideal loan sizes only go so far into what it is that makes them perform the way they do. Deep inside, each of these women truly wanted the best for their family (like providing our \u201ckids with education until they have a title\u201d a HS equivalent), to show that they were independent and could actually help out their husbands, while improving their overall living

Pero ahora, Silvestre quiere mejorar, incrementando la cantidad de animales, los que con el transcurso del tiempo le dar\u00e1n mejores ingresos econ\u00f3micos.

Her customers are the people from the neighbourhood who like her store because of the variety of goods she offers (grains, juices, soups, soft drinks, natural fruit juices etc.) With the income from her business, she pays for her children\u2019s education. <p>\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that the products that she offers are in high demand. Right now she needs to buy 2 100K sacks of rice ($48 per sack), 2 100K sacks of sugar ($43 per sack), 1 drum of cooking oil ($40), and 1 100K sack of beans ($50). By investing in these products, Sra.G. will increase her income and satisfy her customers\u2019 demands.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Jane Agg, Kiva volunteer.<b\/><p>\r\n\r\n\r\nLa Sra.

Her daughter helps her with the business. Saliyakhon begins her workday every morning at 5:00 a.m. She buys the vegetables at wholesale from the local farmers and she sells them in the market. In the market, she is known among the people because of her attractive prices and friendly nature. All this allows Saliyakhon\u2019s business to generate the stable and considerable income for her family. \r\n<p>\r\nNow it is the summer season and her goods are in great demand.

His father is an old and weak man, so Ghulam S. as a boy was virtually the only breadwinner and  had to work hard to support his 8-member family. The family had rented a small store for Ghulam, which he tended to full-time, 7 days a week.  The business went well and Ghulam was soon able to purchase that store.\r\n<p>\r\nAfter the fall of the Taliban, Ghulam and his family decided to return to their homeland, Afghanistan.  They are residents of the eastern Ningarhar province.  Ghulam is pursuing the same business of retail in Afghanistan, but the business is not going well because the inventory is too small for his clientele.  \r\n<p>\r\nGhulam S. hopes to expand his business and therefore his profitability by increasing his store inventory.  Increase of inventory will also make the business interesting as he is bored and almost fed up with the size of the business he has right now.

In 2003, realising that the demand for germinated seeds and young trees in the area was increasing, she discussed with her husband and joined the Fund to borrow money to invest in stock-breeding trees to sell to local people. As she  is responsible and quick in doing business, her business is expanding and so her family's income is also increasing. Currently, apart from working in the factory, Her husband also contributes to the business by delivering the germinated seeds and young trees to the customers, thus cutting down the transportation cost. This way, their profit is higher. This time round, she wants to borrow 15 millions VND (900USD) to invest in buying a variety of seeds to germinate and breed and sell to the local people in the next growing season. Her family's average monthly income is 3.5 millions VND (about 226USD).\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Vietnamese by Pham Yen Thanh, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nCh\u1ecb Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb Nam n\u0103m nay 30 tu\u1ed5i.

As she is friendly and charges reasonable prices, she gets more and more customers and so her family's income is increasingly stable. Beside the income from the clothes shop, her family also has additional income from her husband who is working as a driver. Therefore, her family's income is stable and her children can go to school. This time, she wants to borrow 19 millions VND (1,150USD) to purchase more clothes for the shop.

Thi Doan is 44 years old. She has 4 children, the oldest one is already working while the other three children are still schooling. She joined the TYM Fund in 1998. Before that, her family's income was mainly from farming. After joining the Fund, she discussed with her husband and decided to borrow money to purchase more cows and buffaloes to breed. After almost 10 years, her family now has a large number of cows and buffaloes. As she and her husband are both hardworking, their family's income is very stable. Their oldest child is also working and has stable income. Apart from the income from farming and breeding, her family also has additional income from her husband's horse-wagon transportation service. Therefore, her family's monthly income is always around 3 millions VND (about 193USD). This time round, she wants to borrow 15 millions VND (900USD) to purchase more cows to increase the income.\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Vietnamese by Pham Yen Thanh, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nCh\u1ecb Nguy\u1ec5n Thi \u0110o\u00e0n n\u0103m nay 44 tu\u1ed5i.

Thi Bac is 35 years old. She has joined the TYM Fund since the year 2003. She used the first loan to invest in livestocks but the income was not substantial. Therefore, she used the second loan to invest in buying scrap and recyclable materials to resale to the retailers. As she was  experienced in buying scrap from households as well as determined to increase her family's income, she set up a scrap-buying store at home. Her business gets better and her income increases over time. Besides income from the scrap business, every month her husband earns additional income from construction works, thus her two children can go to school. This round of loan she wants to borrow 19 millions VND (1,150USD) to increase her capital so that she can expand her business.

She has 2 children that are school age.  Before she joined the organization, her family worked in farming and had faced many difficulties.  In 1998, she and her husband had decided to join the organization to seek a loan to invest into raising livestock.  After seeing no success in the farm animals business, Ms. Le Thi T. and her husband decided to obtain another loan to start a new business.  In the beginning, she used the new loan obtained to buy large amounts of manufactured goods to sell to the people in her village and began noticing the business success. After gaining experience with this type of business, she began selling a variety of fresh food products.  She saw the demands for fresh food goods in her village and since been investing more into these goods.  Everyday her husband buys wholesale and bulk merchandise for her to sell in her home. Ms. Le Thi T. is able to bring in more customers by offering reasonable prices on her merchandises.  As a result, her business has been stable and growing.  The income of her business is 4.000.000d\/month.  She is requesting a loan of 15.000.000d to invest into buying more food products and other goods.  This will help increase her inventory, selling them to, and meeting the needs and demands of those in her in her village. \r\n<p> <b>Translated from Vietnamese by Lynn Nguyen, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nCh\u1ecb L\u00ea th\u1ecb T.  n\u0103m nay 42 tu\u1ed5i.

She has 4 grown children.  In 2003, she joined the organization to help her invest in buying livestock in which she raises at home.  From a small investment, she is able to expand her business after 5 seasons.  Presently, she is able to increase her business by raising a variety of farm animals; cows, pigs and chickens all in large amount. Every month, she is able to retain a steady income and her family finance has since been stable.  Besides raising livestock, she was able to purchase cows from other countries to breed.  All of her children all grown and have job stability.  Every month they are able to contribute some of their earnings to the family business.  The family past income has gone from being average to a dramatic increase with the business success.  This time, she is asking for a loan of 15.000.000d to buy more chickens and cows to raise.  A small portion of this loan will be use to buy animal food in bulk at a wholesale price.

Mrs. H. used the money TYM Fund lent her back then to fertilize the soil and build more breeding facilities, which have resulted in a very well-structured system. Her family\u2019s income, as a result, has increased considerably; and they have been able to build a very nice house.

She joined TYM fund in 2003. Initially, Mrs. Hong only took out a small amount of loan to invest into agricultural activities such as breeding and planting in the hope of earning a stable income for her family. After obtaining some experience, Mrs. Hong felt more confident about asking for a bigger amount of loan to revamp the system, build more fish ponds and breeding facilities. Since then, her family\u2019s income has been very stable. When her husband passed away, her determination, diligence and love for her children helped her overcome the grief and keep raising her kids. All of them have already had jobs and helped her with her business. In the next loan level, she wishes to borrow 19 millions VND to buy more fishes and pigs.

She has operated a grocery in her neighborhood for the past 15 years, selling fruits and vegetables and other products.  Florence first started the grocery because there weren\u2019t any in her neighborhood.  She started with just a few items, such as tomatoes and bananas, and gradually expanded her business to include more items.  \r\n<p>\r\nTwice a week, Florence goes off early in the morning to the Owino Market, a large outdoor market near downtown Kampala, and buys about 150,000 (Ugandan shillings) or roughly $90 (US dollars) worth of produce.  She transports the goods back to her grocery stall via motorcycle taxi (boda boda) or minibus taxi (matatu). \r\n<p>\r\nBeing the first grocery to open in her neighborhood guaranteed Florence would have many customers, although there are now other groceries nearby.  Florence's grocery is open seven days a week from 8:00 AM in the morning until 9:00 PM at night, except on Sunday when she opens at 9:00 AM after attending mass.  She is helped by her sister who also works at the grocery. \r\n<p>\r\nFlorence uses the profits from her business to pay school fees for her children.  Profits are getting smaller as food prices go up. Florence has struggled to pay loans back in the face of unexpected expenses, but as she has been a member of MCDT for the last three years, she and her group have been able to repay approximately nine loans.

She lives in the Triangle Zone of Mulago Hill in Kampala.  Her children range in ages from 15 to 30 years old, and the youngest three children are in school.  Her middle daughter, aged 18, is in year S6, her final year of secondary education.  With a Kiva loan, Rehema will be able to enroll her daughter in a vocational course after she graduates, allowing her to obtain productive employment. \r\n<p>\r\nRehema sells bunches of green bananas used to make matooke, a steamed and mashed banana dish, slightly denser than mashed potatoes that is a staple of the Ugandan diet.  It is served with beans or meat in a sauce that flavors the matooke.  Twice a week, Rehema leaves Kampala around 5:00 AM in the morning to travel by public taxi (a minivan that holds 14 people) to Mbarara to purchase the matooke.  Arriving at midday, she frequents different vendors to get the best deals she can find.  She purchases 50 bags, stuffed with bunches of bananas, for 2,500 (Ugandan shillings) or $1.50 (US dollars).  She also arranges for her wares to be transported by truck for 25,000 (Ugandan shillings) or $15 (US dollars), spending the night in Balala before returning the following morning. \r\n<p>\r\nRehema sells the matooke in Kampala at the Kalerwe Market, a large outdoor market that sells all sorts of produce and goods.  By the end of the day, there is often none left.  Other times, she sells the remaining matooke to the women staying at the market.   \r\n<p>\r\nRehema can make a profit of about 50,000 (Ugandan shillings) or about $30 (US dollars), equal to 1000 (Ugandan shillings) per bag on each shipment.  Rehema has been in this business for about 15 years.  She says it\u2019s a business she knows well because she understands how to buy everything she needs to make it run.
