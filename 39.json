Hambali expects to get a loan from DINARI for Rp2,500,000 (about$275) to expand his fried food business. This capital will be used to add more variation of his fried food, so that the consumers would be more attracted to stop by and buy his items. He hoped to profit about Rp50,000(about $5.50)\/day.

is an energic young man. He works hard. Apriandi is still single so he does not have any additional burden yet. Since he lives in a rented room, and did not cook himself, his daily living expense is Rp35,000 (about $3.80). So far Apriandi sells Kebaya (local fashion) shirts in the New Market, Kebo Iwa street in Denpasar, Bali. His motor cycle is essential to run his business, distributing his sales goods. With a capital of $10,000,000.00 (about US$1100), he could profit about Rp50,000-100,000 ($5.50-$11)\/night.  Capital from DINARI will be used to increase the number of his sales items. Apriandi also got an opportunity to open a place in a new location, Darmasaba market. Distance between Darmasaba market and Kebo Iwa New Market is 10km (about 6.5 miles). He sells in Darmasaba market in the morning, and at night at Kebo Iwa new market. He started work at 6:00 AM till 6:00 PM. The rest of time he used to find items for sales, and opportunities at other promising markets. His hope by adding new sales area is to increase daily profit to Rp100,000.00-Rp200,000.00 (about $11-$22).\r\n<p><b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Gwan Liong Ang, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nApriandi anak muda yang enerjik. Dia sangat rajin bekerja. Apriandi belum berkeluarga, jadi dia masih belum memiliki tanggungan. Karena dia tinggal di kos \u2013 kosan dan tidak masak makanannya sendiri, biaya hidup per harinya mencapai Rp 35.000,00. Apriandi selama ini berjualan baju kebaya di pasar baru Jl. Kebo Iwa, Denpasar, Bali. Sepeda motor miliknya adalah sarana yang sangat dia butuhkan untuk kelangsungan usahanya ini dalam mendistribusikan barang \u2013 barang dagangannya. Dengan modal Rp 10.000.000,00 keuntungan yang  diperoleh mencapai Rp 50.000,00 \u2013 Rp 100.000,00\/malam. Modal dari DINARI digunakan untuk menambah jumlah barang \u2013 barang dagangan. Sekarang Apriandi mendapat peluang usaha yang sama di tempat yang baru, yaitu  di pasar Darmasaba. Jarak antara Pasar Darmasaba dengan Pasar Baru Kebo Iwa adalah 10 km. Dia berjualan pada pagi hari di pasar Darmasaba  dan berjualan pada malam harinya di Pasar Baru Kebo Iwa. Waktunya di pasar mulai dari pukul 6 pagi sampai dengan 6 sore. Waktu sisanya digunakan untuk  mencari barang \u2013 barang dagangan yang dia jual dan juga mencari kemungkinan pasar lain yang peluangnya menjanjikan baginya. Harapannya - dengan menambah tempat usaha berdagang - dia  memperoleh keuntungan per hari \u00b1 Rp 100.000,00 \u2013 Rp 200.000,00."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":68634,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To

That\u2019s why Nizami has applied to Norwegian Microcredit Saatli branch for a $500 loan to buy one more pure-bred cow to make his monthly income higher.  This amount isn't enough to cover all of his purchasing expenditures because the price of one calf in the Caucasus region is about $80-100 and Nizami plans to buy ten calves.

Each morning he grazes his herd and then sells beef in the local market of Saatli town.  He uses some of his profit margin to buy calves to breed.

Thanks to both parents having their own microbusinesses, they can offer their children a life without worrying about basic necessities. They own a humble yet beautiful home, where Perla has her business, and her husband is a mototaxi driver. 5 years ago, Perla asked her husband to use a part of their home, that until then was used as the living room, to put in a small business and in this way help with the family income. In this store she sells basic, needed products such as sugar, noodles, and also candy, soda pop and fast food. Her customer service and administration of this new microbusiness made her business grow every day, to the point of having to expand her storefront. While she and her daughter are in chage of the business located in their home, Leonardo, with his motorbike, works as a mototaxi driver within the city and towards Posadas (Argentina). The couple asks for $1000 to invest in finishing the expansion of the store facility in order to be able to offer better service to their clients.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Cindy Kendall, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nLa Sra.

Gracias a que ambos esposos tienen sus propias microempresas, pueden ofrecerles a sus hijos una vida sin mayores necesidades econ\u00f3micas. Poseen una humilde, pero hermosa casa propia, en donde Perla tiene su autoservice, mientras que su marido se dedica al mototaxi.

En la misma vende productos de primera necesidad como az\u00facar, fideos, asi como tambi\u00e9n golosinas, gaseosas y comidas r\u00e1pidas.

She learnt and got to know this trade while she was in the capital working for her older siblings' company which sells these sorts of things.  The support it has brought her husband and kids has been vital, and her kids have been able to go to university in their home town.  She started this business from a small room and served people from the window.  Little by little the business has grown and she now has lots of clients near where she lives.  She now has a very organized room with display cabinets, and she would like a freezer now too so that she can sell ice creams, lollies and cold drinks.  This means that she would be able to offer a better service to all her clients.  In order to do this she needs a loan of $325 which she will repay in 6 months.  She would use it to buy the freezer as Carmen's dream is to own a minimarket.\r\n\r\n<p> <b> Translated from Spanish by Liz Harvey, Kiva Volunteer <b\/> <p>\r\n\r\nCarmen es una se\u00f1ora de 49 a\u00f1os; dedicada al comercio de art\u00edculos de primera necesidad en un peque\u00f1o espacio dentro de su casa, esta actividad  la emprendi\u00f3 y conoci\u00f3 durante su permanencia en la ciudad capital de su pa\u00eds en compa\u00f1\u00eda de sus  hermanos mayores pues ellos se dedican hace ya varios a\u00f1os al comercio de abarrotes al por mayor en dicha ciudad.El apoyo incondicional para desarrollar esta actividad satisfactoriamente se la han brindado su esposo e hijos quienes gracias a los ingresos generados han podido acceder a estudiar en la universidad de su ciudad natal.

salon in the 1990s.  This is her vocation so she decided to go ahead with the shop, even though it was very different from what she was doing before.  She has 4 kids, one of them is at university and the others are at school.  In order to meet household costs Betty relies on her husband who is a motorbike-taxi driver for a security firm.  \r\n<p>\r\nShe started her beauty salon in 1994 with only 2 mirrors and plastic chairs, but thanks to the hard work her and her family put in, it grew and became notable in the community and with her clients.  She decided that she would not give up until she had a complete beauty salon.  She now needs a loan of $500 which she will repay in 6 months so that she can enlarge her salon, buying tools so that she can work effectively, and beauty creams for deep down cleaning for her clients that need it.\r\n\r\n<p> <b> Translated from Spanish by Liz Harvey, Kiva Volunteer <b\/> <p>\r\n\r\nBetty estudi\u00f3 cosmetolog\u00eda hace varios a\u00f1os y mucho antes de dedicarse a esta

The familiarity which they have acquired for this work has proven very useful since it has generated substantial income for the family. Actually, they are currently minding some 2000 birds, for which they want to purchase balanced foods and vaccines with an aim at improving the quality of their meat. To carry out their plan they need work capital in the amount of $400 with a commitment to return the loan over a period of 6 months time, which is more than sufficient  to discharge the debt.

and began this enterprise when she was a teenager-mostly helping her mother, who also worked in food service in a dedicated space in her house. \r\n\r\nShe starts her days very early in the morning by going to the market to buy ingredients for the daily menu. So that she make the most of her trip, she enlists  her husband\u2019s help in transport since they own a taxi that he lets out for public transport service in his community. In this way they both contribute to the family income in order to satisfy household necessities. \r\n\r\nMerlita perpares her foods with extreme care and always gives them a special touch so they have the recognizable character of her kitchen when her clients enjoy them. In order to service the daily menus for her clientele she relies on the help of her daughters.  She hopes to continue working in this position because she is greatly pleased by the content and highly satisfied faces of each and every one of her clients, and with her business she will be able to provide security for the education of her children and little by little be able to have her own restaurant outright.

They have 2 grown independent, employed children. They have an adopted 15 year old son whom they have raised since he was 7 months old. Hermelinda is a hard-working woman who owns a store and dining room where she offers meals to 30 employees of a factory near her home. Her passion for work began with the purchase of milking cows, from which she sold the milk and cheese she made herself. Upon seeing the necessity of a store in her neighborhood, she sold the cows and with that capital she began a well-stocked store and butcher shop where she could serve a greater number of customers. After 5 years of hard work and effort to always treat customers well and give them the best variety of products and prices, she was victim of 3 assults and robberies in her business. This caused a great loss to her business and forced her to close the doors of her business. Hermelinda says that this bad experience only held her back for a few months, and in that same year construction began of a large paper factory across from her home. Herme, as her friends call her, did not let this opportunity pass by. She approached those in charge of the work and offered lunch service for the workers, who accepted since day one. This business has been going for 7 years and little by little she restocked once again with the dream of having her store again, as it was before. Her loan is designated to buying merchandise for her store, such as sugar, tea, rice, meat, flour, noodles, oil, vegetables, and more.\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Cindy Kendall, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nLa Sra.

He would also sell this clothing door-to-door, and as he did so, he realized that he could learn to tailor clothing himself. To perfect his skills, he traveled to the capitol. When he returned to his native city Pucallpa and with the help of his wife, he set up a modest shop where he began working doing what he enjoyed most. He was then able to partner with one of his aunts to open a clothing sales and tailoring stand in a commercial center located on a major avenue of the city. Thanks to his knowledge and experience tailoring clothes, his business has improved. Nevertheless, there are orders, which he falls behind on for lack of cloth and material. Because of this, Jhon is requesting a $200 loan, which he has agreed to repay in 6 months.

Sutiyem lives in a hut made from woven bamboo walls and sand floor (no tiles).  Sutiyem has a business of \"Packed rice\" (nasi bungkus). All of it was done with her children and in laws at home, since they all live in the same one house. Every packed rice was sold at Rp 1500 or Rp 2000 (16 or 22 cents) depending on customer's request. For every package she profits about Rp 200 (2 cents), each day she produce about 100 packages. So in one day she could profit about Rp20,000 (about $2.20).\r\nThe Dinari loan, Sutiyem use to buy a rice warmer: Magic jar, so that her packed rice would still be warm, and her customers would be more satisfied.

Two of her children are part-time farm workers, two are on unemployment and the youngest was disabled in an accident and is not able to work.\r\n<p>\r\nLuc\u00eda started a small business three months ago and quickly realized that it was a great way to increase her income. She sells fresh chicken parts (legs, wings, giblets and so on) and boiled peas. Every day, she buys five live chickens from a poultry house near where she lives and sells the parts.

Dari hasil usahanya ini Ni Ketut Sriani bisa menyisihkan uangnya untuk persiapan  biaya sekolah anaknya  ."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":69329,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase piglets and feed (Membeli bibit babi dan pakan ternak)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2007-09-30T18:05:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Ketut Sriani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-10-14T19:16:28Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":175,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2007-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":29.15}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":30,"local_amount":30,"processed_date":"2007-10-16T01:34:07Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-24T04:40:34Z","rounded_local_amount":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":67781,"comment":null},{"amount":30,"local_amount":30,"processed_date":"2007-11-26T02:38:53Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-24T04:40:34Z","rounded_local_amount":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86612,"comment":null},{"amount":30,"local_amount":30,"processed_date":"2007-12-21T01:42:57Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-24T04:40:34Z","rounded_local_amount":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":100266,"comment":null},{"amount":30,"local_amount":30,"processed_date":"2008-01-21T07:17:32Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-24T04:40:34Z","rounded_local_amount":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":119072,"comment":null},{"amount":30,"local_amount":30,"processed_date":"2008-02-20T01:27:21Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-24T04:40:34Z","rounded_local_amount":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":138532,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-03-24T04:40:34Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-24T04:40:34Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":164680,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2007-09-30T19:16:28Z","paid_date":"2008-03-24T04:40:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":19435,"name":"Celeste","description":{"languages":["pt"],"texts":{"pt":"Celeste N. is a 46-year-old married mother of 5.

Five years ago she decided to dedicate herself to the sale of packaging, and products that she distributed and offered exclusively during the times of fairs in different towns and to villagers that lie around the city.  She started selling in small quantities.  Little by little due to the good service she provided and her charismatic character she continued increasing the quantity of her clients, therefore increasing her income for her home.  In addition to this activity, the days she has free she dedicates herself to offering sewing services and the sale of chocolates.  This generates an additional income for the education of her children.  What Mrs. Lourde hopes is to have a packaging wholesale distribution store.  This work would permit her to be much more close to her family, generate more income, and offer them a better quality of life.
