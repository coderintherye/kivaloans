It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is determined to improve their standard of living. Even though they have their farm she still became involved in her ready-to-wear business. She peddles around her village to her usual customers, selling on both cash and credit terms. Letty is certain that she can save her profits to use for her family's needs and expenses.

is Mrs. Angelina M., who is 33 years old, married and lives at Talairon, Oroquieta City. She is a simple woman, blessed with 3 children. Her husband is a bus driver. In order to help her husband, she decided to open a \u201csari-sari\u201d (general) store adjacent to their house. It started with a capital of only PHP 500. Her primary customers are their neighbors and relatives. She has been able to manage the business well. In fact, their food is paid for with the income from the \u201csari-sari\u201d store. Angelina is also thankful to Paglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative, because it helped her in the expansion, specifically on financial matters. She became a member of the Co-Op in June 2001. She has taken loans several times. Now, she is applying for PHP 10,000 for additional merchandise for sale. She\u2019s looking forward to a comfortable life and plans to expand her business into a grocery store someday.

She wants to have more stock to accommodate the needs of her customers. She needs money for the procurement of additional items for her variety store so Analyn is applying for a loan with HSPFI, a Kiva partner. The amount that will be granted to her will be used for her business and partly for payment of her planned residential lot. According to Analyn, this amount would be of great help to her business and to her family. She is determined enough to change and lift their standard of living.

is a 44-year-old man who lives in Nabatieh in southern Lebanon with his wife and their three children. Hussein has been working as a car repairman and painter for 20 years. \r\n<p>\r\nThis will be his second loan cycle through Al Majmoua and he has always paid on time.

In addition, he's developing a small shop selling various commonly used items. He plans to use this loan to buy products his clientele is asking for, such as soaps, sugar, canned food, etc... in order to bolster his working capital and increase his revenue. Constant is a trained furniture maker, but he's happy to run this business because it provides him with financial means to support his family. He started his business in 1996 with an initial capital of $25, selling corn and  cassava. In 2003, after years of hard work, determination, and, most importantly, good management, he succeeded in achieving a $600 capital. This amount enabled him to buy two used ovens to cook cookies. His capital now amounts to $270, and his business turns a monthly profit of $120. His ambition is to one day open a bakery, because demand for it is very high. Constant is well known in his field, thanks to the quality of his products.

From 1981 to 1990, the evolution of her business enabled her to diversify, adding the sale of soaps, sugar, and dried fish. Political and economical instabilities in the country during the 90's weakened her business. Since 2000, Godeline has been making great efforts to stabilize her business. She decided to join one of the groups of Kiva's partner, HOPE, in order to get financial support to develop her business to support her family. The group she joined is called \"Soutient\". She plans to use this loan to buy one sack of peanuts and one half box of dried fish, to retail in order to increase her revenue. Her husband has been sick and weak since 2005. Her ambition is to open a shop to sell fresh food. Her business turns a monthly profit of $120. Godeline is married and the mother of 7 children, who are between 13 and 28 years old.

She lives on Huandoy Alley in Huaraz Province and District in the Department of Ancash. She is a 38 year old separated mother of three children, all of whom are dependents. With her first loan of 300 soles, Amparo bought more merchandise in the form of socks. She has been working with her village bank for the past two years. \r\n\r\nAmparo is still in the same line of work, and varies the products she sells according to the season. She is currently gearing up for regional holidays in the Callej\u00f3n de Huaylas and Callej\u00f3n de los Conchudos Valleys. \r\n\r\nAmparo will use 80% of her 1700 soles loan to buy more socks and spices. She is currently in delicate health, and will use the other 20% of her loan to pay for a low-risk hernia operation. \r\n\r\nMost of her fellow group members and friends consider Amparo to be a very hard-working, enterprising woman. She says that she when she was growing up, she used to watch her mother work. When she was 12 years old, she started helping her mother, and eventually put together her own capital and started selling on her own; this is how she currently supports her children. She proudly informs us that her oldest son is currently studying at the university and that she works as hard as she does in order to help her children. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Cynthia McMurry, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":324551,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Buy socks, spices","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Huaraz - Ancash","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-9.533333 -77.533333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2009-05-27T22:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Delicia Amparo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1700,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":212.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.88},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.88},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.88},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.88},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.88},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.88},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.88},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":72.04,"local_amount":213,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:45:47Z","rounded_local_amount":217.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44591091,"comment":null},{"amount":71.71,"local_amount":212,"processed_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:26:45Z","rounded_local_amount":216.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52985377,"comment":null},{"amount":72.04,"local_amount":213,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:16:42Z","rounded_local_amount":217.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63205791,"comment":null},{"amount":71.73,"local_amount":212,"processed_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T18:49:45Z","rounded_local_amount":216.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73635019,"comment":null},{"amount":71.88,"local_amount":212.5,"processed_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T22:48:36Z","rounded_local_amount":216.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87074078,"comment":null},{"amount":143.92,"local_amount":425.5,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T02:16:09Z","rounded_local_amount":433.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96989534,"comment":null},{"amount":71.68,"local_amount":212,"processed_date":"2009-12-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:08:46Z","rounded_local_amount":216.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110726603,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-05-30T18:40:31Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:08:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":110887,"name":"Catalina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Catalina es una mujer que a lo largo de su vida ha luchado por salir adelante y darle lo mejor a su familia, tiene 57 a\u00f1os y vive en su propia casa junto a su hijo H\u00e9ctor de 32 a\u00f1os, quien desde la muerte de su esposo es su \u00fanica compa\u00f1\u00eda.

She is 57 years of age and lives in her own house with her son H\u00e9ctor, who is 32 years old and has been her only companion since the death of her husband.  After many years of effort and sacrifice she has finally been able to have the hardware store that she always wanted and which she runs herself.  Her store is called \"Ferreter\u00eda Am\u00e9rica\" (American Hardware) and is one of the busiest in the neighborhood, where the service is friendly and you can always find what you need.  The thing she likes the most about her work is that she has the advantage of being able to complete her household chores while tending to her business.  She's been doing this for five years and the part she finds most difficult is having to remain in the store all day and not being able to go out.  Even so, she knows that she has to fulfill her obligations if she wants to get ahead.  This is Catalina's first loan with Microfinanzas PRISMA and she is determined to make all of her payments on time in order to be eligible for other loans in the future.  She believes this money will be a big help to her in her effort to get ahead.

The love and devotion for her loved ones make her a better mother, wife, and businesswoman.  With this attitude she and her husband were able to achieve their goal of having their own house.  During her years of economic hardship she had to travel around selling sweets to children, who were her main customers.  She did that until, with time and by virtue of her own character, she found favor with the people who tended to see her every morning in the doorways of schools and various locales.  Now she sees them on the corner at the city traffic circle, where, thanks to being granted permission by the local government, she has succeeded in setting up shop; she did have to buy a wooden display stand, which she's been using for six years.  Elvira hopes that doing this will give her the opportunity to satisfy her desire to have her own business in her house, which she's been setting up for all these years, so she can move right in with her products.

She is a street vendor in the municipality of San Juan Sacatepequez, close to where she lives. She tells that she started her business selling 2 or 3 garments, which she bought on credit, and after selling them she would pay, but little by little people started making more orders and therefore she joined a \"Banco de Confianza\" with FAPE. The capital helped her, as with a small capital she could buy some merchandise and pay cash, not all on credit. It is her dream to open a shop so that she does not have to sell on the streets as she has two daughters, 3 years and 7 months old, and it is difficult for her to take both, and if she had her own store she could look after the girls while maintaining her business. The loan requested will help supply her business as her clients ask for a variety of colors and styles, different blouses, girdles, and aprons which she does not have in stock, and she wants to take advantage of the following months as there will be local fiestas at San Juan and San Pedro Sacatepequez. Elsa Marina has the support of her husband who is a carpenter and she is also a support to him as she contributes to the home economy.

Paquito has been engaged in his business for over six years and earns approximately $23 a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Paquito joined the Kiva field partner, GDMPC, to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and his ability to engage in business activities.

L. is from the town of Lopez Jaena. She is 58 years old. Lolita is married and has three adult children. To make a living, Lolita owns & operates a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling daily-use products such as shampoo, soap & toothpaste in the local community. Lolita has been engaged in her business for over 13 years and earns approximately 15,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2000, Lolita joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Lolita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 12,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. Lolita is requesting a new loan of 20000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the sixth loan taken out by Lolita from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

R. is from the town of Lopez Jaena.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from harvesting and selling ocean-caught fish in the local community. Manchuria has been in this business for over eleven years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2000, Manchuria joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living conditions and enable her to engage in business activities. Manchuria has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from PMPC. She is now requesting a loan of 20,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be her 14th loan from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of her family. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About PMPC:<\/b>\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

S. is from the village of Upper Puntod. She is 46 years old. Lourdes is married and has six school-age children. To make a living, Lourdes makes and sells food. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of food products in the local community. Lourdes has been engaged in her business for more than two years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2008, Lourdes joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Lourdes has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. Lourdes is requesting a new loan of 15000 PHP which will also be used to purchase raw ingredients. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Lourdes from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n<p>\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Last year, she was supported by the Kiva fund and she invested her loan in the construction of a home.  She says that she is very satisfied with AFODENIC because it has low interest rates and is accessible to people with limited economic resources.  These loans have enabled her to improve her living conditions.  Ms. Maria paid two months ahead to switch to a new financing plan and in that way continue improving her living conditions.  \r\n\r\nShe is hardworking, honest, and beloved by her parents and the community.  She loves her job as a teacher because she gets to help many rural children from her community to read and write.  Although her own children no longer depend on her, she helps with the care of her grandchildren, and whenever possible she helps her children with some of their family expenses.  \r\n\r\nWith this loan, she expect to install a plumbing system so that she can have more dignified and beautiful housing.  Her dream is that God will bless her with health, work, and better conditions in her home.   \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Leah Karlins, Kiva

Anecita has been engaged in her business for more than 19 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2006, Anecita joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Anecita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 15,000 PHP from GDMPC. Anecita is requesting a new loan of 11000 PHP which will be used additional capital for the business. This loan will be the seventh loan taken out by Anecita from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n<p>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

B. is from the village of Panalsalan, Plaridel Misamis Occidental. She is 64 years old and married with four adult-aged children. To make a living, Venancia operates a \"sari-sari\" or general retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling daily-use products such as shampoo, soap, toothpaste, etc., in the local community. Venancia has been engaged in her business for more than 30 years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2009, Venancia joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Venancia is requesting a new loan of 3500 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell in her \"sari-sari\" store. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Venancia from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to make improvements to her house. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n<p>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

M. is from the village of Panalsalan Plaridel Misamis Occidental. She is 60 years old. Josefa is married and has four adult children. To make a living, Josefa owns & operates a weaving business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling nipa hut and nipa mat. Josefa has been engaged in her business for over 35 years and earns approximately 1,200 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Josefa joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Josefa is requesting a new loan of 3500 PHP, which will be used as additional capital for the business. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Josefa from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

They are both in the primary level.<p>\r\n\r\nMarina has been engaged in selling second-hand clothes for one year already. She is selling different kinds of clothes for men and women on a house to house basis even in nearby villages. Marina would like to request an amount of PHP 4,000 as additional working capital for her business. She aims to grow her business by selling more second hand or used clothes where she could earn higher income. Her income will be increased if she could purchase more goods at once because of the transportation savings she could get. She wants her children to finish their study; that is why she always tries to double her time and effort in selling.

For her, living life to the fullest means living with her family: thus, she works very hard for them. She is only 24 years old and happily married. She and her husband, Michael G., have two children.\r\n<p>\r\nBy maintaining her street food-vending business, Jocelyn is able to help her husband afford their family a simple, contented standard of living. However, the couple works hard for the education of their two children, whom they hope to give a better future by sending them to school through college. Jocelyn has therefore requested a loan from Kiva lenders as capital assistance for managing her business well in order to earn a higher income. She is taking out a small loan in the amount of PHP 5,0000. \r\n<p>\r\nJocelyn wants to expand her business and earn a higher daily income by operating a typical village store business where she can

Cherry Ann, 19 years old, is in her third year of college and is a business administration student. Christopher is 16 years old and is now in his first year of college, taking up education. Celia and her husband struggle to earn enough income to support the college education of their three children. \r\n<p>\r\nWith her small village eatery business, Celia is thankful that she is able to earn a daily income. She has even expanded her offerings to include cooked snacks, such banana cue, \u201cpansit,\u201d and rice cakes. These additional products help her to increase her income. She is thankful that her husband is also doing his best to provide for many of their needs at home, especially in terms of their children\u2019s tuition fees.\r\n<p>\r\nShe hopes that Kiva lenders will soon lend her the amount she has recently requested, a loan amounting to PHP 10,000.

Macasaddu is 46 years old. Her family lives in the rural village of Gadu Solana, Cagayan. She is married to Edmundo Macasaddu, who is a local farmer in their village. They are blessed with a happy family and hope to provide all their four children with a better education someday. \r\n<p>\r\nMarilou manages a vending business where she sells different vegetables, street foods, and canned goods from her vending stall just in front of their house. The business has been in operation for 20 years and she is proud that her long-term business venture has helped her family significantly. \r\n<p>\r\nShe works hard to help her husband. She gets up in the early morning to prepare her store and goes to the market to buy products in bulk. She has gained a lot of clients and is earning a better profit. But Marilou still needs to save for the college education of her four children, and thus she feels the need to increase her daily income. She would like to take out a loan amounting to PHP 17,000.
