He is married to Mercy and they have one daughter. He has been farming maize and beans for 10 years. He also sells rice as another source of income. Munene does not have a permanent structure for his rice business, so he fulfills customer orders that he gets from different towns.\n\nMunene learned about Kadet through a marketing outreach and decided to become a client. He has applied for a loan of Kenya shillings 30,000. In his budget, he plans to use about Kenya shillings 5,000 to buy fertilizer for the farm and Kenya 25,000 to buy rice to sell.

Despite these difficulties, Sofia and her group have found stability in their loans and look forward to continuing to develop their businesses and community.\r\n\r\nSofia will be using this loan, her ninth with Esperanza International, to buy additional merchandise for her store, including bread, juices, and soft drinks. She said that before having loans, it was easy for her and other group members to fail in their businesses because they did not have enough cash flow. Now, however, she and the others in her group have thriving businesses. She is very grateful for past support and excited for the possibilities in the future. Thank you for lending to Sofia and the Caminando Hacia el Progreso group!"}},"status":"deleted","funded_amount":3125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":443392,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"Bread, juices, and refreshments","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"DO","country":"Dominican Republic","town":"San Pedro de Macor\u00eds","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"19 -70.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":44,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sofia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ramon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Olga","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Persia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Santos","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Italiene","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Facundina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eridania","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"DOP","disbursal_amount":111900,"loan_amount":3125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":8409.89},{"due_date":"2009-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":8566.18},{"due_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":8725.37},{"due_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":8887.51},{"due_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":9052.68},{"due_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":9220.91},{"due_date":"2010-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":9392.26},{"due_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":9566.81},{"due_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":9744.59},{"due_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":9925.68},{"due_date":"2010-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":10110.13},{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":10297.99}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":234.86},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":239.23},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":243.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":248.2},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":252.81},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":257.51},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.29},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":267.17},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":272.14},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":277.19},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":282.34},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":287.59}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":159974,"name":"Omolara","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Omolara sells hair extensions and hair cream at retail prices in her shop.

She lives on a farm with her husband, Fray Araya Mas\u00eds, and their son and daughter. Their farm is located in the rural region of Turrialba, in the central valley of Costa Rica. Noily has a small business producing and selling cheese. Fray works on a local sugar cane farm as an agricultural labourer. This will be Noily\u00b4s second loan from Fundacion Mujer. Her first loan, for 100,000 colones, was paid back, on time and in full, in only six months. \r\n\r\nNoily has been producing and selling cheese for 2 years. She started her business with an investment of 600,000 colones. She owns 4 cows and can extract 15 litres of milk per day from each cow. Depending on the quality of milk, 15 litres can yield 2-3 kilograms of cheese. Cheese production is an intricate process that requires attention to detail at every step to ensure a quality product. Because cheese is easily contaminated, Noily must invest in expensive bacteria-fighting chemicals. Noily has found it challenging to manage this necessary cost. In a good week, she produces and sells 45 kilograms of cheese. At 1400 colones per kilogram, this translates into 250,000 colones per month. In a bad month, she might earn 140,000 colones. \r\n\r\nNoily is applying for a loan of 350,000 colones to buy another cow so she can increase her weekly cheese output. Her long term goals are to buy more cows and improve the cheese-production process by creating a workshop separate from her house. At the moment, Noily's kitchen doubles as her cheese-production facility. Noily also wants a line of credit from Fundacion Mujer. This loan is a step in the loan process to qualify Noily for a line of credit.\r\n\r\nRural areas, such as Turrialba, are characterized by many difficulties, such as a lack of job opportunities, infrastructural deficiencies, low levels of formal education, and lack of available financial services. The highest level of formal education Noily has attained is the completion of primary school. Nevertheless, she has developed her talent for the art of commerce. Noily has arranged for a distributor from San Jose (the capital of Costa Rica) to pass by her farm every week. This distributor purchases all the cheese that Noily and her son have been able to produce. The cheese distributor travels from Turrialba to San Jose, where he sells the cheese to various restaurants and shops. \r\n\r\nThe field consultant who has been working with Noily for the past 2 years has described Noily as shy, sincere, and hard working. Loans from Fundacion Mujer have helped her to overcome personal obstacles in periods of depression. Running her business and the resulting relationships she has formed have helped her and her family significantly.\r\n\r\nDuring the 1980's, in an effort to fight the plague of poverty, the Costa Rican government decided to allocate land to impoverished citizens. The Institute of Agricultural Development (IDA) is the governmental body responsible for the selection and approval of citizens for land allotments. Many IDA land recipients, although grateful for the government\u2019s efforts, lack the necessary funds, as well as agricultural know-how, that would allow them to use their lands in an efficient and productive manner. Noily and her family were allocated land because they met the criteria for extreme poverty. Despite her entrepreneurial spirit, Noily's efforts have been hamstrung due to her exclusion from the traditional banking system. \r\n\r\nThis is where you can help. Your loan is a direct investment to improve the living conditions of a family living in a poor community of central Costa Rica. By lending to Noily, a proactive and hard-working entrepreneur, you are enabling her to take the first steps on a path that leads to the end of poverty.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":443529,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":1534,"youtube_id":"OwvmzZUDLt8"},"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To

Most of the members have businesses.  Others have the dream of starting a new one like selling cosmetics and jewelry, buying and selling vehicles, public transportation service, beauty salon, and selling food.  Others are employed by different businesses.  The competition is high, especially in food sales and the sale of cosmetics.  Each day every member hopes for a good result in their sales.  There is much competition, and the members could stay in a stand or in one place waiting for the customers to come to them.  To the contrary, the members travel to sell their things in order to be able to have good sales during the day.\r\n\r\nThe loan is to make their businesses grow with the increase of merchandise at a low cost. It is also to get tools and supplies to increase income.  This is to give their children a better education and a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nMost of the members had only heard of group loans.

She is married to Freddy Chavarr\u00eda Guill\u00e9n. Mayubel sells clothing door-to-door in her neighbourhood. Freddy works in construction. The couple lives with their 3 sons in Turrialba, a rural region in the central valley of Costa Rica. Her full-time job is a domestic worker in a household of 3 grown men and one child. Despite the heavy workload of cooking and cleaning for her sons and husband, she is determined to contribute to the family\u2019s income. This is why she dedicates at least 3 days a week, between domestic jobs and when her youngest son is in school, to her clothing business. \r\n\r\nSince 2006, Mayubel has successfully paid back, on time and in full, consecutive loans in the amounts of 100,000, 200,000 and 300,000 colones. Mayubel is now applying for a loan of 500,000 colones that she will use to buy more items for her inventory in bulk show she can bet better prices from her suppliers. She is happy to be applying for a larger amount than she has in the past. Mayubel wants to purchase a new sewing machine so she can make her own clothes to sell. At the moment, she has one machine, but it is very old and doesn\u2019t work very well. \r\n\r\nMayubel opened her business in 2006 with 100,000 colones. Before her business, she had a domestic worker job that required her to travel from Turrialba to Tres Rios (a 90-minute bus ride each way) every day. She worked for 7 years in a house as a domestic worker and was paid 6000 colones per day, which is the same amount she now earns by selling 2 shirts. \r\n\r\nHaving only completed primary school, Mayubel has few options for employment. Domestic work did not pay well and the job left her exhausted. She started her business as an alternative to domestic work. Now, she says she enjoys her work, and takes pride in being able to make a more significant contribution to family income. In a good month, she can earn 300,000 colones and in a bad month, she still earns 200,000 colones. \r\n\r\nMayubel tailors her business to a range of clients by offering a variety of clothing, for men, women and children. Her sister-in-law makes underwear, which Mayubel can purchase at a good price. The rest of her inventory comes from San Jose, the capital of Costa Rica. \r\n\r\nMayubel is proud to report that her youngest son is very intelligent. She wants to save enough money to enable him to attend university. Her other two sons never finished high school and now work with their father in construction.\r\n\r\nThe field consultant who has worked with Mayubel since 2006 describes her as very shy and insecure. Having loans in her name and handling money has made her visibly more confident in making decisions. Rural areas, such as Turrialba, are characterized by many difficulties such as a lack of job opportunities, infrastructural deficiencies, low levels of formal education and lack of available financial services. By lending to Mayubel, you are making a direct investment in the improvement of the life of her and her family, enabling them to help themselves."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":443565,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":1535,"youtube_id":"cZP48QBSv7E"},"activity":"Clothing

She tells us that she began the business with a friend but, after a while, he moved to the city of Chillabamba, leaving her the business.  She decided to continue with it.

Gloria wants to take advantage of the increasing stream of visitors to town during this time of year and is therefore looking for a relatively large loan to buy additional inventory for the winter, her peak business season.\r\n\r\nGloria appreciates and is thankful for the loan and promises to pay the monthly payments on time.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":443744,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"buying umbrellas and waking canes to sell on the street","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":119,"posted_date":"2009-12-09T21:40:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gloria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":286.83},{"due_date":"2010-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":295.43},{"due_date":"2010-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":304.3},{"due_date":"2010-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":313.44}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":286.83},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":295.43},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":304.3},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":313.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":286.86,"local_amount":286.86,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T10:42:41Z","rounded_local_amount":286.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118034338,"comment":null},{"amount":295.47,"local_amount":295.47,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:04:48Z","rounded_local_amount":295.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123872435,"comment":null},{"amount":304.33,"local_amount":304.33,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:19:08Z","rounded_local_amount":304.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128905693,"comment":null},{"amount":313.34,"local_amount":313.34,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:48:57Z","rounded_local_amount":313.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136633201,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-12-15T15:48:51Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T09:48:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":160127,"name":"Guillermo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La familia A. est\u00e1n muy agradecidos por su cooperaci\u00f3n en el anterior cr\u00e9dito su negocio ha crecido y han tenido muy buenas ventas.\nNueva mente est\u00e1n solicitando un pr\u00e9stamo para poder surtir el negocio ya que desean tener en sus ventas otro tipo de productos como es los lactaos y carnes fr\u00edas.

The selling of fish seems to be gainful and sound, and she desires to spend more on it.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Loreta joined ASHI (Ahon sa Hirap, Inc.), a micro-finance institution and Kiva partner in the Philippines, with the intention of having access to more capital for a bigger income. She is requesting a loan of Php 20,000 for her fishing business. Specifically, Php 12,000 of the loan will be used to purchase fishing net, five rolls of rope and sixteen pieces of bamboo while the balance will be used to pay the operating cost of a laborer.\r\n\r\nLoreta is positive that her business will grow and that she will be able to earn more income to save in making their dreams come true. It will also support her parents, allow them to have a good life and to overcome poverty in their standard of living. She also wants to have her own family and own house in the upcoming years.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":443893,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase

S. is 58 years old, married to Orlando who is a fisherman with an average income of Php 160.00 per day. The couple have four children, the eldest son is 34 years old and the youngest is 13 years old. \r\n\r\nEustaquia and Orlando have been engaged in backyard hog raising (raising of pigs) for one year and have been a member of ASHI for almost one year. Their business has been the biggest support for their day-to-day needs especially their children's schooling. Through her determination and by being a good mother, Eustaquia provides for the needs of her children with the help of her business because her husband's income as a fisherman could not afford their children's education. This is why Estaquia is engaged in this business which also supports her four children's dreams.\r\n\r\nThey dream that someday their business will grow and that they can have a stable hog farming business in the future and a good life. She is proposing to borrow a loan amounting to Php 20,000.00 for additional capital in their hog raising business to prolong their fight against and rise up from poverty. Eustaquia will use the loan for the purchase of five piglets worth Php 7,500.00, five canvas sacks of feed amounting to Php 5,500.00, five sacks of binlid (food for pigs) and vitamins at a cost of Php 7,000.00, for the expansion of her business in order to sustain her family in a steady way of living. She hopes to see herself enjoying the profits of her business and to have a good life.

Now on her third loan, she proposes to borrow the amount of Php 15,000 pesos as additional capital, again for her sari-sari store. Specifically, the amount will be used to purchase six sacks of rice worth Php 8,400.00, 50 kilos of sugar at Php 2,100.00, 50 bottles of cooking oil at Php 1,000.00, 50 packs of cigarettes at Php

This is his tenth successful year in business! He employs two people from his community and the hours of his business require that he works from 6 a.m. until late in the evening every day except Sunday.\n\nDiogene is requesting his first loan from Kiva lenders via Vision Finance Company.

This amount will be mostly used as a source of added capital to her expanding business by buying additional stock and as payment for the monthly amortization of their motorized tricycle.\r\n\r\nShe dreams that her business will continue to grow so that when the time comes, they will have the resources to send their children to college. \r\n\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Ny H. lives in Prey Mean village in Takeo province. She is a pig breeder. Her husband, Mr. Siem Moeun, is a farmer who owns a plot of land to cultivate rice. Although this couple works hard, they still earn little income to support their family. Thus, Mrs. Ny H. decided to ask for a loan to buy more piglets, pig food, and fertilizers, and she would use the rest of money to buy some food to make soup to sell.

Gemma Santurdio is a woman who dedicated her life after marriage to her husband and five children. She worked very hard at several activities just to have her own income to augment that of her husband, a fisherman. Looking back on how she painfully started her life being a mother and a wife, she has learned that getting away from poverty was never easy. However, the determination she saw in her children to attain a higher level of education and finish college gives her courage and strength to combat poverty. With the help she has found in ASHI, KIVA's field partner in the Philippines, she is certain that she will change her family\u2019s standard of living in the near future. \r\n<p>\r\nGemma believes that in scrap and junk there is wealth. Aside from her desire to help her community maintain the cleanliness of its surroundings, Gemma also wants people to realize the value of maximizing things that they thought were useless in earning money. Therefore, she thought of putting up a business buying and selling scrap and junk. Empty plastic bottles, cans, used papers and metals are examples of things she buys from people and sells to a junk shop. For two years now, this business has been Gemma\u2019s great financial provider. Someday, she really hopes to put up her own junk shop and to increase the proceeds from it.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":444102,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Recycling","sector":"Services","use":"To finance

S. would prefer to be a plain housewife and a full-time mother to her three children, who range in age from one to seven years old. However, she thinks that if the family depends on her husband alone to provide them money for buying basic things they need daily, the kind of life she will give to her children until they grow up will be the same. As a driver of a tricycle (motorcycle with sidecar that is used for transportation), Girlie's husband Bernabe earns only a small income. \r\n<p>\r\nBecause of this, Girlie changed her plans last year, and she embraced the opportunity to get a loan through ASHI to invest in a business. After a year of realizing her happiness in running her own business and having her own income, she is requesting a much larger loan to further grow her business and profit; this will enable her to

She is capable of running her own business to earn money, which she uses to support her mother and her own family. Since 2008 she has been requesting loans through her membership in ASHI, KIVA's field partner in the Philippines. Thos loans have made her productive by growing a business. All throughout her membership, she has showed very good performance in repayment and attendance during weekly center meeting. She enjoys the camaraderie of her fellow members in ASHI as well as the input about managing a small business she learned from them. \r\n<p>\r\nWith a much larger amount of business capital in addition to the knowledge she has learned from her fellow small entrepreneurs, Eufemia would be able to enhance the growth of her business, with the help of her husband and a 46-year-old child who is a laborer and lives with her. Therefore, at this point of her membership in ASHI, she is requesting a certain amount based on the need of her business and her capacity to pay back.

They are on average 34 years old with 3 children. They met each other through neighbours and through their businesses, and they sell a variety of products. Having repaid their first joint loan without any problem, they are now on their second loan with a view to diversifying and making their business profitable. This loan will be used to buy 3 pieces of 30-meter long white bazin, 10 wax-printed loincloths, 35 items of children's clothing (baby clothes, dresses, trouser suits, skirt suits), 20 sets of chains, earrings, bracelets and some rings, 12 bottles of varnish, 12 khol pencils, 250kg of rice and 500kg of \"fabourama\" tubers. Most of the time they get their supplies from the Ch\u00e2teau de S\u00e9gou market, from the fairworkers coming from Massigui, and at Niono. They sell their goods at the same Ch\u00e2teau de S\u00e9gou market, the wax-printed loincloths while walking through the Hamdallaye neighbourhoods and the \"fabourama\" at the market in M\u00e9dine. The goods are sold for cash and on credit to both male and female customers. They are expecting to make an average monthly profit of 27,835 FCFA which will be used to repay loans, and also to contribute to household expenses and social events (baptisms, marriages, circumcisions and funerals), the purchase of items which will gradually make up young girls' marriage trousseaux as well as the building up of savings. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Le Bras, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":444143,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchase of various products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Segou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14 -6","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-12-09T14:50:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rokia                   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Oumou                                ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zarra                                 ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sitan\t ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Oumou                                 ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":450000,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2010-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2010-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2010-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":75000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":170.83},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":170.84},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.83},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.83},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.84},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":170.83,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2009-12-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T17:06:35Z","rounded_local_amount":75492.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110763611,"comment":null},{"amount":170.84,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2010-01-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-26T09:12:27Z","rounded_local_amount":75492.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118152446,"comment":null},{"amount":170.83,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-18T08:49:00Z","rounded_local_amount":75492.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123991287,"comment":null},{"amount":170.83,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2010-03-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-20T08:20:45Z","rounded_local_amount":75492.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129021558,"comment":null},{"amount":170.84,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2010-04-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:15:29Z","rounded_local_amount":75492.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136746353,"comment":null},{"amount":170.83,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:36Z","rounded_local_amount":75492.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144778899,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-12-10T02:38:51Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":160283,"name":"Mrs. Sok Heang Village Bank Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This village bank loan, which consists of thirteen people, is located in Svay Village in Takeo province and all the members will use the loan for different purposes.\r\n\r\nMrs. Sok H. is the village bank president.

Mercedes also got the idea to put up capital for a canteen eatery (preparation of ready-to-eat food) because of the demand.\r\n\r\nCurrently on her seventh loan, Mercedes proposes the amount of Php 35,000 as additional capital to purchase stock and more supplies for her consumers' demands. Stock includes items such as soft drinks, beer, drinks, meat, fish, vegetables, rice, Fundador, cooking oil, sugar, etc.\r\n\r\nMercedes has disciplined herself to use all of the borrowed capital from ASHI-KIVA for her business, to gain more profit and to use that profit to support daily expenses. She got involved in ASHI (10 years) for the dreams of her family, to send her children to school and to finish their studies with a degree. Actually, she has already completed half of her dreams because her children have their degrees but she didn\u2019t stop dreaming for her grandchildren, to offer them the best education, as she provided for her children. The couple feels very happy with the loan that changed their lives to be better than before. Mercedes wishes all lenders all the best and good luck and will continue to support her family and the expanded business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":444152,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food
