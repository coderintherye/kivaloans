He uses the income from the business to provide for himself and his younger siblings who are now able to attend school.\r\nBecause of his superior marketing skills he has been contracted to supply pay phones to rural women groups.\r\nThe women groups will use the pay phones as income generation activities. In Kenyan rural areas communication is limited by lack of telephone hand sets.

K. will provide the groups with after sale maintenance services. \r\nK. is requesting for a loan of U.S $ 450.He Will use the amount to purchase 10 community pay phones and 5 repair kits.

She has one child who stays with her mother because Josephine has been unemployed and could not be able to provide for the child.\r\nShe recently started a business of selling chicken to local hotels and individual buyers at the Municipal Market. She learnt the art of chicken dressing from her grand father who use to trade at the same market before retiring.\r\nShe started her business by stocking chicken given to her on credit by her mother\u2019s friends. She sells the chicken then pays the creditors leaving some income for her. Sometimes she is unable to get the birds on credit and sometimes the Friends do not have the birds.

She is living alone with her two (02) children and four (04) other children whom she cares for. Abandoned by her husband who has been living clandestinely in Europe for more than 5 years, Madam Adjoa BLEVI courageously manages to support all her family expenditures. Having dropped out of primary school very early, she started bread selling along roads and streets. Very ingenious, she has early understood that to better succeed in life, she must be her own mistress. That is why she underwent the training in bread making. Also enterprising and very courageous, she didn\u2019t hesitate, from her first credit to build a hard packed oven for bread making and selling. Thanks to the quality of her breads, she is more and more solicited but she is very limited by her means and cannot satisfy her clients who are getting more and more numerous. Madam Adjoa A. really induces trust through the quality of her products and especially the good management of her two credits of $ 450 and $ 650 respectively. She promptly paid reimbursed.\r\n\r\nThe new credit of $ 850 in request will serve to buy the wheat flour and sugar in order to assure availability in stock as in the period of Christmas and New Year those stuffs become scarce and expensive. Surely, this credit will have a positive impact on Madam Adjoa A., because it will help her to increase her production and income to improve her socio-economic living conditions.\r\n\r\n<p> \r\n\r\nMadame A. Adjoa est boulang\u00e8re \u00e2g\u00e9e de 40 ans. Elle vit seule avec ses deux de ses propres enfants et quatre (04) personnes \u00e0 sa charge. Abandonn\u00e9e par son mari qui vit en clandestinit\u00e9 en Europe depuis plus de 05 ans,  Madame A. Adjoa prend son courage \u00e0 deux mains et se d\u00e9brouille pas mal pour supporter toutes ces charges familiales. N\u2019ayant pas eu la chance de terminer au moins le cours primaire, elle s\u2019\u00e9tait lanc\u00e9 dans la vente de pain au bord des rues. Tr\u00e8s ing\u00e9nieuse, elle a compris tr\u00e8s t\u00f4t que pour mieux r\u00e9ussir sa vie, il faut \u00eatre ma\u00eetresse de soi-m\u00eame. C\u2019est ainsi qu\u2019elle s\u2019est lanc\u00e9e dans l\u2019apprentissage de la fabrication du pain \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9chelle manuel. Aussi entreprenante et tr\u00e8s courageuse qu\u2019elle soit, elle n\u2019a pas tard\u00e9, par son premier cr\u00e9dit \u00e0 construire un four en terre battue pour la fabrication et la vente du pain. Aujourd\u2019hui, de par la qualit\u00e9 de ses pains, elle est de plus en plus sollicit\u00e9e mais ses moyens se trouvent tr\u00e8s limit\u00e9s pour satisfaire sa client\u00e8le qui, sans cesse, ne fait qu\u2019augmenter. Madame A. Adjoa nourrit r\u00e9ellement confiance \u00e0 travers la qualit\u00e9 de ses produits et surtout la bonne gestion faite de ses deux premiers respectifs de $450 et $650 obtenus et promptement rembours\u00e9s.\r\n\r\nLe nouveau cr\u00e9dit de $850 sollicit\u00e9s servirons \u00e0 acheter de farine de bl\u00e9 et du sucre afin d\u2019assurer le stock de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 car en p\u00e9riode des f\u00eates de no\u00ebl, ces denr\u00e9es deviennent tr\u00e8s rares et tr\u00e8s co\u00fbteux. Ce cr\u00e9dit aura a coup s\u00fbr un impact positif sur Madame A.

After his training as vulcanizing professional, he decided to live in his own and open a workshop. But he lacked financial means, mainly materials to begin his activities. He had his first credit of $150 which he paid back. His second credit of $ 350 allowed him to rent a larger shop, proof of considerable growth of his activities. Now, he wants to extend his activities to the sale of used tyres and inner tubes, for these items are in strong demand. This needs more financial means that Mr K. does not have; he is married and father of three (03) children.\r\n\r\nThe credit of $750 he applied for will be spent on buying a compressor pump, tyres and inner tubes in extension of Mr K. activities in order to have materials at the same place to satisfy his customers who are more and more demanding.

His very poor parents can\u2019t take care of a large family. He was obliged to stop his studies early at primary school level. Thanks to an uncle who took him as an apprentice tailor, he became a skilful worker and quickly gained experience, and obtained his diploma of tailor embroiderer after four (04) years of apprenticeship. His socio-economical situation did not allow him to quickly be on his own. It took him a long time to get married; today he has three (03) children and has five (05) apprentices in his charge. His life is getting better since he received his first credit of $ 300 which he smoothly paid back. His second credit of $ 550 brought him success and his workshop receives prospects everyday. With his dynamism, perseverance, rigor in the management of his workshop and his well done work, Mr M. is more and more needed, but he doesn\u2019t succeed in satisfying his customers in due time because of the lack of sewing machines. These festive period in which there are increasing demands, constitute a nightmare for him.\r\n\r\nThis credit of $ 850 will help him buy a more performing embroidery machine so that he can be quicker in his activities and mainly improve the quality of his services. The realization of this project will considerably improve his income and his economical and financial potential which will make a change in his social and family environment.\r\n\r\n<p> \r\n\r\nMonsieur M.

Il doit son salut \u00e0 un oncle qui le recueille comme apprenti tailleur. Tr\u00e8s assidu dans ce m\u00e9tier, il gagna rapidement en exp\u00e9rience et obtint son dipl\u00f4me de tailleur brodeur apr\u00e8s quatre (04) ans d\u2019apprentissage. Sa situation socio \u00e9conomique ne lui permettant pas de se prendre rapidement en charge, il mis du temps pour se marier et a aujourd\u2019hui trois (03 enfants et a \u00e0 sa charge cinq (05) apprentis.

She managed with a lot of difficulties to open her workshop. But the revenue she derives from this job is not enough to meet the needs of her family for her husband has no good job. As a result, poverty constantly dwells in her household. Having observed life in her area, she noticed that the inhabitants do not accede to basic foodstuff in the quarter. She thus decided to start a small foodstuff business with an amount of $ 65 saved up. This provides her, additional revenues apart from her seamstress job. Having realized that the little trade is profitable, she decided to expand it. To meet the target, she requested and obtained a credit of $350 which she easily managed and paid back.    \r\n\r\nAs the end of year festive period is approaching, Mrs. A.

After primary studies in her village, she went to Lom\u00e9 where she put up with her aunt, a great storekeeper at \u201cGrand March\u00e9\u201d of Lom\u00e9. Her aunt trained her very well in trade activities, and she started to show her interest in such activities and in setting up her own business. She thus opened a small restaurant bar which she started with $95. Through that activity, she provides at least at 80 % of her family needs, as her husband continually unemployed for 10 years, does not fulfil his family responsibilities. All the children are cared for by the Madam Yawa T. who is constantly fighting for their education and success in life. With rigor and good management skills, she succeeded in managing the two first credits of $200 and $400 respectively before the end of the loan term. Which increased credibility and trustworthiness for any other application.\r\n\r\nThe credit request of $ 850 will serve to buy one freezer and a stock of supplies with views to strengthening her restaurant bar. The expansion of her activities through the marketing of fruit juice and ice block will allow her to increase her income and consequently to improve her living conditions and those of her family.\r\n\r\n<p> \r\n\r\nMadame T.

is a widow with one grown up son and several grand children. She is an active member of Queen Esther Group and has benefited a lot from the group through loans she has been getting. Her first loan from KIVA of USD 300 enabled her to install electricity in her rental rooms. This lead to increment of monthly charges from USD 7 to USD10. She was also able to install power in her house which made a significant change in her life. Her family was touched by the loan because since she got married she had not seen electricity in her house. The whole family was touched by the loan and their living standard changed abit. Her grandchildren work as a team and they grow varieties of vegetables for sale and they help her in loan repayment. She supports the children with the income she get from rental rooms and she has housed them. She believes knowledge is power, thus it\u2019s her responsibility to pay fees for her grandchildren as their father is not bothered. She finished paying her last loan payments in the last group meeting and she feels the next loan will not strain her much.This will enable her grand daughter to report to school on the opening date rather than staying for 2 weeks waiting for the tenants to make their monthly repayments. After paying the school fees for one year Lucy makes her monthly loan installments through Queen Esther women group. Lucy finds these arrangements very convenient for her family, her tenants and the school where her daughter studies

Amah was born on 30th January 1966 in Aneho. He is a welding professional with 5 years of unsatisfactory practice owing to harsh competition from welding shops in a very saturated area. As he has no money to go and settle in another town, he decided to start market gardening for welding did not allow him to yield any revenue. After a 3 month training, he started the market gardening activity along the lagoon of the area. He specialized in the growing of okra a highly appreciated and widely consumed vegetable of Togo. The activity is very profitable for it is an out of season crop. However, the small size of the surface exploited and the lack of modern tools do not allow him to increase production and make revenues large enough to meet the needs of his wife and ten (10) children. He therefore took a first credit of $ 250 to expand his surface and purchase input. Demand is still on the rise and his current production fails to match it. The market is then far from being saturated, chiefly in the dry season that has started and where there is an acute shortage of okra on all markets.   \r\n\r\nThe credit of $ 850 requested by M. S. Amah will help acquire a motor-pump, four (04) watering cans, input, fertilizers and herbicides products. The project has a great advantage: it is located by a lagoon and at the seaside.  \r\n\r\n<p> \r\n\r\nMonsieur S. Amah est n\u00e9 le 30 Janvier 1966 \u00e0 An\u00e9ho. Soudeur de formation, il a exerc\u00e9 le m\u00e9tier pendant 5 ans sans rendement satisfaisant \u00e0 cause des multiples ateliers de soudure install\u00e9s dans un milieu tr\u00e8s satur\u00e9. N\u2019ayant des moyens pour aller s\u2019installer dans une autre ville, il d\u00e9cida alors de se lancer dans le mara\u00eechage car avec la soudure, il n\u2019avait pratiquement plus de revenu. Apr\u00e8s une formation de 3 mois, il commen\u00e7a l\u2019activit\u00e9 de mara\u00eechage au bord de la lagune de la localit\u00e9. Il se sp\u00e9cialisa dans la culture du gombo, condiment bien appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 et tr\u00e8s consomm\u00e9 au Togo. Cette activit\u00e9 lui est tr\u00e8s rentable car c\u2019est une culture de contre saison. Toutefois, la petitesse de la superficie exploit\u00e9e et le manque d\u2019outil moderne ne lui permettent pas d\u2019accro\u00eetre sa production et d\u00e9gager un revenu ad\u00e9quat aux besoins de sa femme et de ses dix (10) enfants. Il pris alors son premier cr\u00e9dit de $ 250 pour agrandir sa surface et acheter les intrants. Les demandes sont sans cesse croissantes que la production actuelle n\u2019arrive pas \u00e0 couvrir, ce qui prouve l\u2019existence de ce march\u00e9 qui est loin d\u2019\u00eatre satur\u00e9, surtout en saison s\u00e8che qui s\u2019annonce o\u00f9 on constate une grande p\u00e9nurie du gombo sur tous les march\u00e9s.\r\n\r\nLe cr\u00e9dit de $850  sollicit\u00e9 par Monsieur S. Amah servira  acqu\u00e9rir une motopompe, 04 arrosoirs, des intrants et les produits phytosanitaires. Le projet b\u00e9n\u00e9ficie d\u2019un grand atout qui est sa situation en bordure de la lagune et de la mer.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":4495,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"To acquire a motor-pump, 04 watering cans, input, fertilizers and herbicides products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TG","country":"Togo","town":"An\u00e9ho","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"8 1.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":22,"posted_date":"2006-11-24T23:42:48Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":850,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Amah","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2006-12-10T19:23:12Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":850,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2007-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2007-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2007-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2007-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2007-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2007-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2007-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2007-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2007-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2007-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2007-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2007-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":85,"local_amount":85,"processed_date":"2007-01-02T06:31:33Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-29T09:16:47Z","rounded_local_amount":85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":3824,"comment":null},{"amount":85,"local_amount":85,"processed_date":"2007-01-02T06:32:11Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-29T09:16:47Z","rounded_local_amount":85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":3825,"comment":null},{"amount":170,"local_amount":170,"processed_date":"2007-02-21T14:56:52Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-29T09:16:47Z","rounded_local_amount":170,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":7757,"comment":"Madam Amah SOSSOUVI-ATAYI thanks sincerely KIVA and all those who have contributed to her project funding which allows her today to increase her activities and automatically her incomes to her proper living conditions improvement and those of her family.

Maria saw a great opportunity in her community to open a phone center, where the locals could go to her phone booths and make calls. This is a particularly good business in these sectors of Guayaquil because people cannot afford to install phone lines in their homes. Therefore, these phone call centers are very popular throughout Guayaquil, especially because they also offer the ability to make international calls to family members who are overseas which can be very expensive, even for those who do have phone lines. <\/p>  \r\n\r\n<p>Maria\u2019s husband has been extremely supportive in this new venture. They slowly accumulated their savings in order to buy the substantial start up investments necessary to launch this business. Maria now wants to put in two computers that have internet connections. Before she can do this she has to add a gate to her entrance and put in an alarm system in order to deter criminals from robbing her. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maria has four children, one of which works at the business at night. Their family ties are very strong and they all do their part to help the business. Maria\u2019s goals include continuing to improve her house which she always tries to keep up. <\/p> \r\n\r\n<p>Mifex offers its clients microinsurance and access to business training and educational programs.

C., a 61-year-old widow, native of the District of Matutuine, in the south of the province of Maputo, has 8 children and 6 grandchildren, grew up in the Swiss Mission church and was not able to attend school due to the differences between the colonial government and the church.\r\n<p>\r\nAfter the death of her husband, who was a fisherman, 6 years ago from an illness, she has gone through many difficulties because the reserve of savings was used to take care of the hospital expenses of her late husband.\r\n<p>\r\nAfter the death of her husband, with a group of 12 members under her care, she had no choice but to continue the work her late husband did, even though the equipment was in a precarious state and the sea was polluted by the Greek petroleum ship, Katina P. \r\n<p>\r\nEven with these problems, she met the challenge, and with her youngest son who, at the time was 14, started the work up again, with him as captain of the ship.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2001, she found out about the Microfinance Institution called Hluvuku-Adsema, which operated around 45 km from where she was, so she went there and requested a loan to acquire and rehabilitate fishing equipment. This was accepted and she also benefitted from training on business management. With this loan, she was able to revitalize the microbusiness, and several others followed to maintain and expand the business, totalling 6 loans in all. Given her low level of schooling, she has received continuous monitoring from the Hluvuku-Adsema staff in order to generate more business and ensure the repayment of the loans. This work won her 3rd place in the Global Micro-Businessperson Contest held in Mozambique in 2004, during the commemorations of the International Year of Microcredit.\r\n<p>\r\nShe currently has a motor boat and 8 permanent workers. With a loan of 20,000 meticais, she plans to buy more fishing nets in order to increase her production capacity, create more jobs - it should be 4 more seasonal workers - as well as buy a freezer with 270 L capacity to be able to better preserve the fishing products.\r\n<p>\r\nHer activity has a greater impact on the life of the community because, in addition to generating more jobs for the people who work directly with fishing, she creates more jobs for the people who acquire the product to later resell it. She also contributes to a continuous supply of a range of seafood to the city of Maputo, greatly contributing to improve the population\\'s diet.\r\n<p>\r\n<p>\r\n<p><b>\r\nThe original business description in Portuguese is below:<\/b>\r\n<p>\r\nLocaliza\u00e7\u00e3o: Catembe, Maputo, Mo\u00e7ambique\r\n\r\nCliente: Marta C.\r\n\r\nSector de Actividade Pesca\r\n\r\nValor de Empr\u00e9stimo: 20.000,00 Mtn  (769 US$)\r\n\r\nAplica\u00e7\u00e3o do empr\u00e9stimo: compra de redes pesca e sistema de frio( congelador)\r\n\r\nInicio - 14\/11\/2006\r\n\r\nFim \u2013 06\/05\/2008\r\nMarta C., vi\u00fava de 61 anos de idade, natural do Distrito de Matutuine, sul da prov\u00edncia de Maputo tem 8 filhos e 6 netos, cresceu na igreja da Miss\u00e3o \u2013Sui\u00e7a e n\u00e3o conseguiu frequentar a escola divido as diverg\u00eancia  entre o governo colonial e a igreja.<p>\r\nDepois da morte do Marido que era pescador \u00e0 6 anos v\u00edtima de doen\u00e7a atravessou muitas dificuldades porque a reserva das economias  foram usadas para custear as despesas de hospitalares do falecido.<p>\r\nDesde a morte do marido e com um agregado de 12 membros sob a sua responsabilidade, n\u00e3o tinha alternativa para a continuidade da actividade que o falecido marido exercia uma vez que para alem do estado prec\u00e1rio em os equipamento se encontravam, o mar estava polu\u00eddo pelo petroleiro grego \u201cKatina P\u201d.<p>\r\nMesmo com estas dificuldades desafiou a situa\u00e7\u00e3o e com o filho mais novo que na altura tinha 14 anos reiniciaram a actividade, este como capit\u00e3o da embarca\u00e7\u00e3o.<p>\r\nNo ano de 2001, teve informa\u00e7\u00f5es da exist\u00eancia de uma institui\u00e7\u00e3o Micro-financeira denominada Hluvuku-Adsema, que operava a cerca de 45km da sua localidade tendo se deslocado para l\u00e1 e solicitou  um empr\u00e9stimo para aquisi\u00e7\u00e3o e reabilita\u00e7\u00e3o de equipamento de pesca, o qual foi aceite e tamb\u00e9m beneficiou-se de forma\u00e7\u00e3o  sobre gest\u00e3o de neg\u00f3cio.

They had six children.\r\n<p>\r\nShe never had any training in terms of business management, and only attended the first year of elementary school.\r\n<p>\r\nBefore starting her fishing activity, she worked with the sale of seafood for two years, buying from the fishermen and reselling in Catembe and the city of Maputo. Her husband worked at the Cigarette Factory and when the company closed, he received severance pay. With the money, he bought a boat and 5 heads of cattle, and having arranged a second wife, he went to live in a neighboring area with his new wife. Joana was then living only with her youngest child.\r\n<p>\r\nWith the boat, she started to develop the fishing activity, having created two (2) jobs but it was difficult to get money together for the replacement of fishing nets and repair of the boat itself. Through some people in her area, she found out about HLUVUKU-ADSEMA and went there to request financing of 12,000.00 meticais for the purchase of fishing materials (nets and other consumables), which improved the work and production conditions  to some extent. With the credit paid off in seven months, rather than the sixteen months that were anticipated, she currently has a 5 meter boat. To expand, through this financing, she would like to increase production and create three (3) more jobs through the purchase of nets and painting the boat. She personally sells some of the fish in Catembe at a stand she acquired for that purpose, and the other part she sells to resellers. In addition to having generated jobs, her activity has a greater impact on providing seafood to improve the diet in her community (Catembe) and generates indirect jobs for the resellers who buy her fish and resell in the city of Maputo.\r\n<p>\r\n<p><b>\r\nThe original business description in Portuguese is below:<\/b>\r\n<p>Localiza\u00e7\u00e3o: Bairro Guachene Catembe, Maputo, Mo\u00e7ambique\r\nCliente: Joana Luis M.\r\nSector de Actividade: Pesca\r\nValor  de Empr\u00e9stimo :16.385,00 Mtn (630.00 US$)\r\nAplica\u00e7\u00e3o do montante de Empr\u00e9stimo: Compra de materiais de pesca e repara\u00e7\u00e3o de barco\r\nIn\u00edcio: 13\/11\/2006\r\nFim: 12\/11\/2007\r\n<p>\r\nJoana Luis M., de 48 anos de idade, natural do Distrito de Manhi\u00e7a, prov\u00edncia do Maputo, durante a sua inf\u00e1ncia n\u00e3o teve possebilidade de estudar depois que se juntou com seu marido, veio morar no bairro de guachene no Distrito municipal da Catembe. tiveram seis filhos. \r\nEla nunca teve nenhuma forma\u00e7\u00e3o em mat\u00e9ria de gest\u00e3o de neg\u00f3cios, estando a frequentar o primeiro ano de Alfabetiza\u00e7\u00e3o.\r\nAntes de iniciar a actividade pesqueira, dedicava-se \u00e0 venda de mariscos a dois anos, comprava nos pescadores e revendia na catembe e na cidade do Maputo.

He describes life as a challenge but also full of opportunities. He had to interrupt his studies due to financial circumstances and, like others, he was born to a poor family. He was obligated to go work for a craftsperson at age 8, where he acquired work experience and cultivated the entrepreneurial spirit, despite not having any training in business. From his monthly income, he managed to save an amount that helped him build a mini-store with conventional goods and start his own business. His wife is manager of the business and both work to survive. After some time, he heard of HLUVUKU-ADSEMA, approached it and requested a loan in the amount of 10 thousand meticais (US$250) to expand his business which, as he tells it, performs well for him. With the income, he has been able to obtain land to build his own house. At this time, he lives in a room loaned to him and he plans to live a dignified life with his wife (his family). He says that he plans, at this time, to expand the business to be able to employ 2 more people, along with himself and his wife, to be able to improve service to customers and increase the family income for a good education of their children, as well as to help other family members.

She did not have the opportunity to go beyond 7th grade in school. At age 17, she became pregnant for the first time by a boyfriend who did not want to take on the responsibility, and so Ezelina stayed in her parents' home. It was another start to difficulties in life and, as she tells it, she saw a world full of uncertainties. A few months later, she asked her father for support in the amount of 100 meticais (US$4) to start a business to be able to support the child she was eagerly expecting. At that point, business was not going well (yet another frustration) and she chose to look for a job at kiosks and, with the typical problems of a first pregnancy, she couldn't handle the work hours and had to return to the business that she had been doing. Conscious of the first failure, she contacted a group of women to hear about their experiences with the use of credit and to learn to save.\r\n<p>\r\nShe currently has a business that performs well and operates in a precarious mini-store and plans to remodel as soon as she obtains a refrigerator to expand the business with a range of products.\r\n<p>\r\nShe plans to enroll her older child in a secondary school, continue to bring a varied selection of essential products close to her customers and improve the conditions of the mini-establishment.

Aos 17 anos contraiu a primeira gravidez de um namorado que n\u00e3o quis assumir a responsabilidade, assim sendo, Ezelina permaneceu em casa dos pais e era mais um princ\u00edpio de dificuldades na vida e, segundo conta, via um mundo cheio de incertezas. \r\nPoucos meses depois, solicitou ao pai um apoio no valor de 100,00mtn ( 4, usd) para iniciar um negocio para poder sustentar o filho que esperava com ansiedade.

L. has been in the bread business for 11 years.

Felicita operated the business end of things and only a year ago left her job at the factory to start her own venture. However, the Lainezes lack capital to step up production. Running a bakery is perhaps one the most time-consuming businesses because you have to prepare bread for the next day the night before. Felicita and her husband open their doors at 6am every day, but their day starts well before that. This husband and wife team usually sells out by 10am, which is when they take their first break. Then, they start their second shift at 1pm selling bread to the afternoon crowd. By the time they sell out, clean the shop, prepare the dough for the next day, and leave the shop it is 10pm. Felicita does this every day with her partner. Ms. L. needs this loan so she can buy certain raw materials like flour, butter, cooking oil, yeast, raisins, nuts, and jelly for the sweet pastries. Felicita is already financing a refrigerator which she uses to keep milk and juices cold. \r\n\r\nThis 26 year-old entrepreneur is married with 2 small children. Together with her husband she has worked hard to grow the business into a profitable enterprise. They currently rent an apartment in Guayaquil and hope that one day they can purchase their own home.

is married and the mother of two daughters. She has quite a bit of experience in managing small businesses and the correct use of credit, since she has been doing this since the year 2000. She started to work with credit from another microfinance institution that was operating in the area, and was successful in the business with the help of her husband who is a former soldier. L\u00facia tells that before building this mini-store, she sold at another, which was precarious, and with the income she was able to grow the business. The first loan she had with HLUVUKU-ADSEMA was to expand the business.\r\n<p>\r\nWith this financing, she plans to reinforce the business stock, which is short of meeting the needs of her customers in Bairro 3, in the Boane District, which is 35 km away from the capital of Mozambique, Maputo. This neighborhood is home to a population of 1300 people, the majority demobilized from the war.\r\n<p>\r\nShe also plans to bring in a worker to help her with sales, since at this time, when she goes to make purchases, she closes the store, which has been very inconvenient for the customers.\r\n<p>\r\n<p><b>\r\nThe original business description in Portuguese is below:<\/b>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nLocaliza\u00e7\u00e3o: Bairro 3, Boane,Maputo,Mozambique\r\nNome do cliente:\tL\u00facia S.\r\nSector de actividade:\tCom\u00e9rcio\r\nValor de empr\u00e9stimo:\t25.000,00mtn (961.00 US$)\r\nAplica\u00e7\u00e3o do empr\u00e9stimo:\tCompra e venda de produtos de 1 necessidades\r\nData de in\u00edcio:\t17\/11\/2006\r\nDura\u00e7\u00e3o:\t16\/11\/2007\r\n\r\nL\u00facia, \u00e9 casada e m\u00e3e de duas filhas com bastante experi\u00eancia em gest\u00e3o de pequenos neg\u00f3cios e uso correto de cr\u00e9dito desde ano 2000 que vem exercendo a atividade. Come\u00e7ou a trabalhar com cr\u00e9dito de uma outra institui\u00e7\u00e3o micro financeira que operava na zona e tendo sido bem sucedida no neg\u00f3cio com ajuda do marido que \u00e9 pensionista ex.- militar. L\u00facia conta que antes de construir este mini estabelecimento, vendia num outro de material prec\u00e1rio e com as receitas foi fazendo crescer o neg\u00f3cio. O primeiro empr\u00e9stimo que teve com a HLUVUKU-ADSEMA, foi para ampliar o neg\u00f3cio. \r\n\r\nCom este financiamento pretende refor\u00e7ar o stock no neg\u00f3cio que est\u00e1 aquem das

maioritariamente desmobilizados de guerra.\r\nTamb\u00e9m pretende admitir uma trabalhadora para auxilar-lhe nas vendas, pois neste momente quando vai as compras encerra o estabelecimento, o que tem sido um grande constragimento para os clientes. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":4897,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

This Madam L. was launched in the small table trade, then progressively she succeeded to open a shop which she manages very well despite she is illiterate (neither read, nor write).

incapacity of her poor parents to pay the school fees. After few years spent to follow her mother in the market, she has opted for the cloth dressing. Today, married and mother of four (04) children, she manages herself her workshop with difficulties, for lack of financial means despite the support of her husband who does not succeeding himself to make (both) ends meets. Very dynamic and devoted with her experience in the domain for about 20 years, Madam D., has made proof of a trusty woman from her two first credits repaid without incident. She has a mastery of her businesses and deserve to be backed financially in order to allow him to enlarge her workshop and substitute the haberdashery.\r\n\r\nFor that purpose, Madam D. requests a credit of $950 which will serve to enlarge her workshop, to acquire a new sewing machine to buy and resell the articles of haberdashery (buttons, zippers, linings, hairpin, etc.). Surely, this credit will give her a second breathe at the economic plan what would have without doubt positive consequences on her family life and on her children education which she wants by all means. \r\n\r\n<p> \r\n\r\nMadame D.

Apr\u00e8s quelques ann\u00e9es pass\u00e9es \u00e0 suivre sa maman au march\u00e9, elle opta pour l\u2019apprentissage de la couture. Aujourd\u2019hui mari\u00e9e et m\u00e8re de quatre (04) enfants, elle g\u00e8re elle-m\u00eame son atelier de couture non sans difficult\u00e9s, faute de moyens financiers malgr\u00e9 le soutien de son mari qui lui-m\u00eame n\u2019arrive pas \u00e0 joindre les deux bouts. Tr\u00e8s dynamisme et d\u00e9vou\u00e9e avec son exp\u00e9rience dans le domaine depuis presque 20 ans,  Madame D., a fait preuve d\u2019une femme de confiance \u00e0 partir de ses deux premiers cr\u00e9dits rembours\u00e9s sans incident. Elle a une ma\u00eetrise de ses affaires et  m\u00e9rite d\u2019\u00eatre soutenue financi\u00e8rement afin de lui permettre d\u2019agrandir son atelier et en substituer la mercerie. \r\n\r\nPour ce faire, Madame D.

Yao Adj\u00e9t\u00e9 was bon in 1954, he is father of four (04) children born to different mothers and is in charge of eleven (11), other children. As a volunteer school teacher, he earns a miserable and irregular salary, and as a result, his life is miserable. After his marital mishaps, he pulled himself together and currently shares his life with only one woman in his village \u201cAlinka\u201d. The village currently suffers from lack of clean water chiefly during the dry season where water becomes a scarce commodity. Women and children go a long way to buy water.\r\nHe is very dynamic and sociable, and as the president of the village development committee (CVD), he had the idea of initiating a drilling to help the population find potable water in the village. The ever growing density of the local population fostered the profitability of the project. The rigorous sense of management shown by Mr. N. with his (03) credits which he promptly reimbursed allowed us to believe in his abilities to succeeded in this ambitious and humanitarian project.    \r\n\r\nOn that purpose, he applied for a credit of $2,000 that will allow realising the drilling from which the water will be sold to the population. Note that in Togo, water is not free of charge. It is sold and at a high price in places where it is scarce. \r\n\r\n<p> \r\n\r\nMonsieur N. Yao Adj\u00e9t\u00e9, n\u00e9 en 1954, il est p\u00e8re de quatre (04) enfants de m\u00e8re diff\u00e9rente et a \u00e0 sa charge onze (11) autres personnes. Enseignant volontaire avec un salaire minable et irr\u00e9gulier, il m\u00e8ne une vie de mis\u00e8re. Apr\u00e8s ses m\u00e9saventures conjugales, il s\u2019est ressaisi et vit aujourd\u2019hui avec une seule femme dans son village natal \u00ab Alinka \u00bb. Ledit village souffre terriblement de probl\u00e8mes d\u2019eau potable, surtout pendant la saison s\u00e8che o\u00f9  l\u2019eau devient une denr\u00e9e tr\u00e8s rare et tr\u00e8s cher. Les bonnes femmes et les enfants parcourent de longue distance pour aller payer de l\u2019eau. Tr\u00e8s dynamique et sociable, et en sa qualit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9sident du comit\u00e9 villageois de d\u00e9veloppement (CVD), il eut l\u2019id\u00e9e d\u2019initier un forage pour aider la population \u00e0 trouver de l\u2019eau potable sur place dans le village. La densit\u00e9 de la population sans cesse croissante dans cette localit\u00e9 favorise la rentabilit\u00e9 de ce projet. La gestion rigoureuse dont Monsieur N. a toujours fait preuve \u00e0 travers ses trois (03) cr\u00e9dits re\u00e7us et rembours\u00e9s promptement permet de croire \u00e0 la r\u00e9ussite de ce projet ambitieux et humanitaire.\r\n\r\nPour ce faire, il sollicite un cr\u00e9dit de $2000 qui servira \u00e0 faire le forage dont l\u2019eau sera vendue \u00e0 la population.

A. Kafui was born on 24th September 1976 in Lom\u00e9, she is married and mother of three (03) children and has three (03) additional children to care for. She lives with her husband in Atakpam\u00e9 Kondji in the canton of Togbl\u00e9. Her core business is petty trade and the marketing of fetched rain water in a village where potable water is scarce. As the village grew and its density raised, an imperative need for potable water developed and it became a very expensive commodity. The government of the country has no means to provide drinkable water to the population of this village; the population therefore suffers a lot from the situation. Knowing that the rain water as fetched and unprocessed is not without danger, she carried out a little feasibility study that allowed her to launch a drilling project that will provide her with additional income. \r\nOn that purpose, she applied for a $ 2000 loan to realise the drilling. Despite her low level of education, (primary school class 6), she showed rigor in the management of her activities. Financing this project will not only be an economic action but also an humanitarian deed that will save many human lives.   \r\n\t\r\n<p> \r\n\r\nMadame A. Kafui, n\u00e9e le 24 Septembre 1976 \u00e0 Lom\u00e9, est mari\u00e9e et m\u00e8re de trois (03) enfants avec trois (03) autres personnes \u00e0 sa charge. Elle vit avec son mari \u00e0 Atakpam\u00e9 Kondji dans le canton de Togbl\u00e9. Elle a comme activit\u00e9 principale le petit commerce et la vente d\u2019eau de pluie recueillie, car le village manque cruellement d\u2019eau potable. Avec le d\u00e9veloppement du village et la densit\u00e9 de la population, il y un imp\u00e9rieux besoin d\u2019eau potable et celle-ci se vend tr\u00e8s ch\u00e8re. L\u2019Etat n\u2019a pas les moyens de doter la localit\u00e9 d\u2019eau potable et la population en souffre mortellement. Ainsi se d\u00e9veloppent, entre autres, les maladies diarrh\u00e9iques surtout chez les enfants. Consciente que l\u2019eau de pluie telle que recueillie et non trait\u00e9e, n\u2019est pas de bonne qualit\u00e9 pour la vie, elle a men\u00e9 une petite \u00e9tude de faisabilit\u00e9 qui lui a permis pouvoir se lancer dans le projet de forage qui va lui rapporter des revenus compl\u00e9mentaires. \r\n\r\nA cet effet, elle sollicite un cr\u00e9dit de $2000 pour faire un forage. Malgr\u00e9 son niveau d\u2019\u00e9tude tr\u00e8s limit\u00e9, (CMII), elle a fait preuve de rigueur dans la gestion de ses activit\u00e9s. Financer ce projet serait un geste non seulement \u00e9conomique mais humanitaire qui sauvera beaucoup de vies

from Ahonkp\u00e8 is a solidarity fellowship comprising twelve (12) women and created four (04) years ago. Its target is improving the living conditions of its members through economic activities, education, cultural and social activities, the creation of solidarity within the fellowship and mutual assistance to members. The members are in the 26-52 age group. All members are illiterate except the secretary that manages administrative and bookkeeping documents. The fellowship already received three credits of $400;$1000, and $1500 that were all reimbursed smoothly. \r\n \r\nJust like the entire Ahonkp\u00e8 village, this group of women is confronted with a serious problem of potable water. The consequences are very dramatic in a village where child mortality rate is very high. The main drinking water source is a stagnant water pool exposed to all sort of water born diseases. So they had the interesting humanitarian idea of realising a drilling with views to providing the village with potable water to guarantee the health of the population chiefly the children. \r\n\r\nOn that purpose, the female fellowship \u201cNOVISSI of Ahonkp\u00e8\u201d applied for a credit of $ 2000 to achieve its project of water drilling in order to sell water to the entire population of the village. Financing this project is not only an economic action but also a humanitarian one: it will help contribute to the reduction of the child mortality rate in the village of Ahonkp\u00e8, in the suburban area of Lom\u00e9. \r\n\r\n<p> \r\n\r\nNOVISSI de Ahonkp\u00e8 est un groupe de solidarit\u00e9 constitu\u00e9 de douze (12) femmes cr\u00e9\u00e9 il y a quatre (04) ans. Il a pour objectif, am\u00e9liorer les conditions de vie de ses membres par l\u2019exercice des activit\u00e9s \u00e9conomiques, \u00e9ducatrices, culturelles et sociales, cr\u00e9er une solidarit\u00e9 en son sein et faire des entraides mutuelles entre les membres. L\u2019\u00e2ge des membres varie entre 26 ans et 52 ans. Tous les membres sont analphab\u00e8tes \u00e0 l\u2019exception de la secr\u00e9taire qui tient les documents administratifs et comptables. Le groupement a d\u00e9j\u00e0 b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 de trois cr\u00e9dits respectivement de $400, $1000 et $1500 qui sont tous bien rembours\u00e9s sans incident.\r\n\r\nCe groupe de femme tout comme le village de Ahonkp\u00e8 est confront\u00e9 au probl\u00e8me s\u00e9rieux d\u2019eau potable. Les cons\u00e9quences sont tr\u00e8s dramatiques dans ce village o\u00f9 le mortalit\u00e9 enfantine est tr\u00e8s \u00e9lev\u00e9. La principale eau de consommation est un point d\u2019eau stagnante expos\u00e9 \u00e0 toute sorte de maladie hydrique. Alors, elles ont eu cette id\u00e9e g\u00e9niale et humanitaire de faire un forage afin de doter le village d\u2019eau potable pour garantir la bonne sant\u00e9 de la population surtout celle des enfants. \r\n\r\nA cet effet, le groupement f\u00e9minin \u00ab NOVISSI de Ahonkp\u00e8 \u00bb sollicite un cr\u00e9dit de $2000 pour r\u00e9aliser son projet de forage dont l\u2019eau sera vendue \u00e0 la population.

With her secondary education level and her large experiences, Anoko has shown the proof of a good manager through her three respective credits of $200, $350 and $550 obtained and regularly repaid without incident.\r\n\r\nSo, by the actual project, Anoko is requesting a credit of $1000 to buy in whole the articles of haberdashery to growth her businesses. This will help her to increase her income and improve the living conditions of her children. She could then be happy and deserve entirely all the respect that needs the struggling woman.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nMadame L. Anoko est une femme divorc\u00e9e depuis bient\u00f4t 9 ans parce que son \u00e9poux a trouv\u00e9 une autre femme qu\u2019il a jug\u00e9 plus belle et ayant une situation tr\u00e8s confortable. Comme cela ne lui suffisait d\u2019humilier Anoko de vilaine, l\u2019homme a de surcro\u00eet abandonn\u00e9 tous les quatre (04) enfants \u00e0 sa charge, mettant ainsi Anonko dans une mis\u00e8re totale. Face \u00e0 cette situation tr\u00e8s pitoyable, elle a r\u00e9cup\u00e9r\u00e9 la mercerie de sa m\u00e8re qu\u2019elle g\u00e8re avec vigueur et d\u00e9termination il y a 8 ans. Avec son niveau d\u2019\u00e9tudes secondaires et ses larges exp\u00e9riences, Anonko a fait preuve de bonne gestionnaire \u00e0 travers ses trois cr\u00e9dits respectifs de $200, $350 et  $550 obtenus et r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement rembours\u00e9s sans incident.\r\n\r\nAinsi, par le pr\u00e9sent projet, Anonko sollicite un cr\u00e9dit de $1000 pour acheter en gros les articles de mercerie pour accro\u00eetre ses affaires. Ceci lui permettra d\u2019augmenter ses revenus et de facto am\u00e9liorer les conditions de vie de ses enfants. Elle pourra d\u00e9sormais s\u2019affirmer et m\u00e9riter pleinement tout le respect qu\u2019\u00e0 droit une femme combattante.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":5362,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing
