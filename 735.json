She made a nice income and bought a small piece of land nearby, on which she's now putting up two more greenhouses.  There haven't been any changes to Olga's home or family.

It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a 5 PHP-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Mary Ann earns money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling them by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 800 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 20,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n\r\nMary Ann hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she hopes to have another extension of her store.

is Carmelita, 62, a resident of Silang, Cavite Philippines. She is a widow and the mother of four children, one of whom is already married. She, together with her children, manages her own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her family's everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nCarmelita operates a retail store where she sells dishwashing products. What she basically does is buy dishwashing products from wholesalers, and then sell them piecemeal for a profit. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 300 Philippines pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operation of her business, she is requesting a loan of 10,000 PHP. She will use the loan to buy dishwashing products to increase her inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n\r\nCarmelita hopes to be able to expand soon, and dreams of giving her family a good future through all her hard work on her business.

She was born in the Panfilovskoye village, in a simple family of a farmer with five children.  Since childhood, she has been helping her mother with taking care of the house and the younger children.  Zarina was accepted into the Architectural University in 2002, where she studied for five years, and in 2007, Zarina returned to her parents in her native village.  In 2008, Zarina got married at the age of 23.  Her first daughter was born a year after that, in 2009, and then another daughter one year later.  In search of a source of income for her family, Zarina and her husband decided to purchase a retail space in the Kainda village in 2010.  Having invested an initial capital, the young family bought out the retail space and purchased a new inventory of merchandise.  At the present time, thanks to Zarina's love of hard work and persistence, her store yields about 12,000 som (KGS) per month.  In order to further develop her business, Zarina requested a loan in the sum of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to expand the assortment of merchandise.  She plans to invest the profits into refilling her merchandise inventories and updating her retail equipment.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":483.32,"image":{"id":940336,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to

Jackline is 22-years-old and lives in the town of Kasese in the Fort Portal region of Uganda. For the past three years, Jackline has been working hard to manage her clothes store which sells various kinds of clothing. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Jackline has requested a loan of 400,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more bundles of clothes and will help Jackline to generate greater profits and pay her children's school fees. Jackline hopes that in the future she will be able to buy a plot of land and build a home. \r\n\r\nJackline is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training. The ELA program has increased Jackline's future prospects by helping her to learn how to save money.

Her husband works at a high school in the village Spartak, managing the economy. \r\n\r\nKarachach grew up in a family of farmers and her parents were for a long time engaged in animal husbandry. Having extensive experience with farm management, Karachach's family started working with livestock and field-crop cultivation 20 years ago. The administration of the village Spartak provided for rent of land, where they grow sweet corn, sugar-beet and cereals. Currently, at the farm, Karachach has four dairy cows and 15 sheep, and the income from selling milk to producers of dairy products is in total around 15,000 som (KGS). \r\n\r\nWith an aim to expand her business, Karachach turned to the organization \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 130,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of milking cows, wheat seeds of good quality and fertilizer for spring planting. Karachach has plans to buy a car for her family, as the family home is located 35 km from the district center.

Prior to the marriage, she was studying to be a jewelry maker and is now involved in a fine jewelry business.  She makes women's national jewelry from gold with unusual designs.  Nasiba sells her goods at a market and primarily makes the jewelry to-order.  She has a large catalog of samples for every taste.  She does not yet have apprentices because she has a small child and would not have time for apprentices.  In the future, Nasiba plans to open her own shop and teach her trade to young women.

She is a woman who is not afraid of the difficulties encountered along the way to her destiny.  She was able to raise her only daughter by herself.  She gave her daughter an education.  She separated from her live-in partner, and from that time on she has been in charge of her household.  She lives with her only daughter and her grandson in her own house.  Every day they share the desire and enthusiasm of getting ahead and having a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nJuana makes clothes.  She makes her own designs, and she makes clothes for her customers.  They always seek her out so that her magic hands will make their garments.  They have faith that she will do a very good job.  She has a small workshop in her house where she does all of her work.\r\n\r\nShe started her work 20 years ago.  She started making simple things.  With time and experience she decided to make more complicated things until she managed the good finishing touch that she now has.\r\n\r\nShe works alone, and she is more than happy to be doing what she likes.  Things are going very well for her.  She has a lot of customers who ask for her very often.  Also, when there are no customers she makes her designs.  That way she is able to sell in her free time.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning she felt of little use in her house.  She only waited for the money that her live-in partner earned from his work.  But, she decided to do something.  From then on she is more than happy to be able to do this work.  It has allowed her to live her life with a measure of comfort.  She now wishes to work more and more in order to be able to continue growing with this work.\r\n\r\nThis will be her first loan with MFP.  She is very happy to know that she will have financial support through the loan that she was granted.  This way she will be able to firm up some plans she has for her business.  She pledges to be a responsible member and to make her payments punctually.  She wants to work well with her communal bank, where there are good references about being supportive and punctual\r\n\r\nShe will use the requested 1,000 soles to buy materials to be able to continue with her work.

Besides this job, she also works as a nurse at a health center near her house.  At night she and her husband sell food, so they have three sources of income for the family's well-being and security.  \r\n\r\nShe has been handling her own businesses alone since before it was her mother who did it.  Now she works alone although her mother helps, too.  What she enjoys about her work is that she is able to be involved in three activities while also studying.  She is grateful for her success and hopes to grow and expand her business to obtain more income.  \r\n\r\nThis is her third loan through MFP.  She is content knowing that she can count on financial support since this gives her more security in advancing in her work.  She is committed to paying back the loan on time, as with previous loans.  She enjoys her communal bank because all the members are responsible and supprotive.\r\n\r\nShe plans to use the 2,000 PEN loan to buy merchandise for the store and the necessary ingredients to make the food she sells. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":353.74,"image":{"id":940821,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy products for her store and ingredients to prepare food.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-12-14T08:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luz ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":310.12},{"due_date":"2012-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":302.91},{"due_date":"2012-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":330.27},{"due_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":342.59},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":348.57},{"due_date":"2012-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":365.54}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.3},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":113.59},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.85},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.47},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":130.71},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":116.3,"local_amount":310.12,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:51:42Z","rounded_local_amount":313.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250836295,"comment":null},{"amount":113.59,"local_amount":302.91,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:19:36Z","rounded_local_amount":306.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257246056,"comment":null},{"amount":123.85,"local_amount":330.27,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:32:16Z","rounded_local_amount":333.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263386076,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-12-20T23:07:54Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":368670,"name":"Agustin","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Agustin es casado, tiene 41 a\u00f1os de edad, curs\u00f3 el segundo a\u00f1os de educaci\u00f3n primaria, tiene 3 hijos los cuales est\u00e1n estudiando, se dedica a la artesan\u00eda, al tejido de cortes t\u00edpicos, inici\u00f3 este trabajo como operario y hasta el momento lleva 30 a\u00f1os de experiencia.\n\nSolicita un pr\u00e9stamo que lo utilizara para la compra de un tejar y mejorar su producci\u00f3n.

Gulumkan has been working as a teacher at a local school for five years. In 2006 seeking additional source of funding for her family Gulumkan started her business in breeding of cattle. Using the starting amount of 15,000 soms (KGS) Gulumkan was able to develop her business which at present time amounts to nine cows yielding about 10,000 som (KGS) from sales of milk and dairy products. In order to further develop her business she has come to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan in the amount of 100,000 KGS to purchase additional stock. In the future Gulumkan plans to increase the number of cattle to be able to give education to her children.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":941025,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase cattle.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Akaryk village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2011-12-10T01:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gulumkan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"loan_amount":2150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2012-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2012-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2013-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":40000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":215},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":430},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":645},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":860}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2011-12-13T06:25:38Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":368746,"name":"Ly","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Originally from a village located in the Kang Meas district, Ly is a 32-year-old married mother of three children, two of whom are still in school.
