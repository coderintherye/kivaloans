He resides with his wife and two children in a traditional family with other households in the Sido Sonincoura district of the city of S\u00e9gou (4th administrative region of the Republic of Mali).  He attended Koranic school, and in the fourth grade (of the education system of Mali), he dropped out.  Then he started to run income-earning businesses, such as gardening, with his father.  Thanks to the income derived from this business, he started selling vegetable oil at the Chateau marketplace seven years ago and enjoys a large number of customers and fame.  Sales are made using a manual pump, which measures the oil.  \r\n\r\nConcerned about satisfying continually growing customer demands, he has turned toward Soro Yiriwaso, with which he has been associated for 12 months.  After one individual loan, properly repaid, he is now on his second loan, which he intends to use to buy 200 liters of vegetable oil (either in 10- or 20-liter containers) locally in S\u00e9gou from wholesale merchants.  \r\n\r\nHe sells at the retail level while accepting cash or credit from customers composed of men and women.  \r\n\r\nHe envisions realizing a monthly profit of 70,000 francs CFA that will enable him to provide for his family and to increase his working capital.  His ambition is to expand his business and to diversify it.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva

is 23-year-old Elizabeth M. from Mbozi.

She works at the business for nine to twelve hours per day, six days a week, assisted by one employee. Elizabeth currently earns about $120 from her business. She is requesting a loan in order to purchase more shoes in bulk for her business. In the future, she plans to improve the quality and range of her products. Elizabeth thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":388844,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"To

from Tanzania!

Perpetua owns a small duka (or neighborhood shop) in the city, where she has been selling common household and grocery items since 2003. She works at the business for nine to twelve hours a day, six days a week, assisted by one employee. Perpetua currently earns about $120 from her business.

Perpetua thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":388856,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase more sugar, rice, salt and other home needs for reselling","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbozi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.75 32.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-09-16T19:50:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Perpetua ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":600000,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.16},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.16},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:32:51Z","rounded_local_amount":103233.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97023063,"comment":null},{"amount":79.16,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:45:01Z","rounded_local_amount":103233.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103868304,"comment":null},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:47:09Z","rounded_local_amount":103233.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757500,"comment":null},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:54Z","rounded_local_amount":103233.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146594,"comment":null},{"amount":79.16,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:16:31Z","rounded_local_amount":103233.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123984739,"comment":null},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:01:11Z","rounded_local_amount":103233.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129015412,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-09-16T23:07:26Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:01:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":137210,"name":"Esther","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Esther is twenty years old.

He will use the profits from his business, which is his family's primary source of income, to purchase better food and school supplies for the children, to paint his house (an important first line defense against termites and weather) and if there is some money left over he would like to purchase a television for his family to enjoy (when there is power of course). His long term goal is to continue growing his business and provide a stable income in the future. He thanks you all for your support.

Competition is especially high in the retail market, so the members are obligated to diversify their merchandise or move their vending posts to areas where this less competition.  \r\n<p>\r\nThey have requested a loan so that they can purchase merchandise to make them more competitive.  They will also be able to acquire their own vending posts in places that are more competitive so that they can generate better earnings.  Therefore, they will be able to provide their families with a better quality of life.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

Her cows together produce 15 liters daily, and each liter is bought for 92 cents by the stocking business, which in turn sells to one of the principle dairy producers of the country. \r\n<p>\r\nShe also sows corn husks in a small nearby plot of land in order to feed her livestock but what she sows regularly is not enough to feed them. For this reason she is asking Edpyme Alternativa for a loan of 1000 nuevos soles for the first time. She wants to invest this money in providing a balanced diet for her livestock in order to increase their milk production.\r\n<p>\r\nIn the long term she wants to buy a Holstein cow because the cows she has are Creole and they don\u2019t have the level of production that she wishes to obtain.  On the other side, she hopes that her bulls develop completely so she can begin to use them in farm work. \r\n<p>\r\nHer husband also works as an agricultural laboror, and between the two of them they try to support their children, four of which are in school.

They have four cows that produce 15 liters daily. Like all the other cattle farmers in the region, they sell their milk to the local stocking business for 92 cents a liter. This business in turn sells to one of the principle dairy producers in the country.\r\n<p>\r\nHer husband works sporadically as an agricultural laborer. Although she also sows corn husks to feed their livestock, the quantity of income that they receive is not enough to support their family and their children, who are in school. It is for this reason that they are asking Edpyme Alternative for a loan of 2000 nuevos soles that they want to invest in providing a balanced diet for their livestock to increase their production of milk, as well as in the construction of drinking and feeding troughs that facilitate feeding. \r\n<p>\r\nMar\u00eda dreams of gradually improving her livestock, increasing their production through an adequate diet and with genetic improvement of the breed. She also hopes to improve her house with the earnings that she collects in the future as well as grant to her children the possibility of studying for a technical degree for limited time. She is very well-liked by her neighbors who consider her a very loving and serving woman.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kelley Maynard, Kiva

She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

Th\u1ecb is a 29-year-old female living in the town of Thanh Ho\u00e1.  H\u1ed3ng is the group leader of a four-member group loan offered by Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.  The official name of this borrowing group is 21 (021 Qu\u1ea3ng H\u01b0ng).\n\nH\u1ed3ng is married and has two school-aged children.  To make a living, H\u1ed3ng owns and operates a general store.  The main source of income for the business comes from selling daily-use products such as shampoo, soap and toothpaste in the local community.  H\u1ed3ng has been engaged in this business for over six years and earns approximately 1400000 (~80$) VND a month from these activities.\n\nIn 2005, H\u1ed3ng joined Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  H\u1ed3ng has successfully repaid a previous loan of 2442600 VND from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell.  She is now requesting a new loan of 6000000 VND which will also be used to purchase additional products to sell.  This will be her seventh loan from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  H\u1ed3ng plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.\n\nAbout the Other Borrowers in the Group:\n\n1.  N. Th\u1ecb Nh\u00e2m (63) is a 32 year-old female who is requesting a 6000000 VND loan to support her business in the food sector running a food stall.\n\n2.  N.

Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\n\n\nH\u1ed3ng N.

Th\u1ecb is a 39-year-old female living in the town of Thanh Ho\u00e1.  Tuy\u1ebft  is the group leader of a four-member group loan offered by Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.  The official name of this borrowing group is 17 (017 Qu\u1ea3ng H\u01b0ng).\r\n\r\nTuy\u1ebft  is married and has two school-aged children.  To make a living, Tuy\u1ebft operates a family member's food stall.  The main source of income for the business comes from selling rice products in the local community.  Tuy\u1ebft has been engaged in this business for over five years and earns approximately $84 a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, Tuy\u1ebft  joined Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Tuy\u1ebft  has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3079800 VND from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  This previous loan was used to invest in renovating the business.  She is now requesting a new loan of 6000000 VND which will also be used to invest in renovating the business.  This will be her ninth loan from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  Tuy\u1ebft  plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the Other Borrowers in the Group:\r\n\r\n1.  N. Th\u1ecb Huy\u1ec1n (42) is a 28 year-old female who is requesting a 6000000 VND loan to support her business in the food sector running a food stall.\r\n\r\n2.  N.

Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n\r\nTuy\u1ebft  N.

is hard to be a single parent to five children, even when they are already adults. You still have to guide them and act as both mother and father to them. This is the experience of Mrs. Corazon O., a 57-year-old widow who lives in the village of Tuburan, in the town of Pontevedra, Negros Occidental. Four of her five children have their own families and earn their own living. The youngest is 21 years old and still lives with her while she is attending college.\r\n\r\nCorazon has owned and managed a pottery business for more than 30 years. She has a loyal clientele that patronizes her business because they know she produces high quality pottery in designs and colors that are suited to their taste.  But being successful can sometimes create problems - good ones!  Because of the high demand for her products, she ran short on working capital.  She did not want to miss the opportunity to expand her business, and this is the reason why she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 - to have access to additional capital when she has large orders that require a lot of raw materials.\r\n\r\nIn addition to her pottery business, she diversified and opened a cafeteria so that she could earn additional income. In the five years that she has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon, she has maintained her good credit performance, and she earns on average a net profit of PHP5000 per month. Her last loan of PHP14000 was fully paid on time.  Now on her 9th loan cycle, she is borrowing PHP15000 to infuse more working capital into her business ventures. Her main objective now is to have her youngest son graduate from college and start his own life. Corazon is also starting to save for herself so that she will not be a burden to her children when she grows old.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women.

Erlinda has been engaged in her business for over four years and earns approximately 8,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Erlinda joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and to increase her ability to engage in business activities.  Erlinda has successfully repaid a previous loan of 25,000 PHP from GDMPC.  Erlinda is requesting a new loan of 40,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell as well as to invest in the expansion of her business. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees for her children and to save for future emergencies. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":389267,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase additional products to sell and invest to expand her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Montol, Ozamiz City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":136,"posted_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:51Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":850,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Erlinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":40000,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":40000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":850}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":127.5,"local_amount":6000,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T22:29:36Z","rounded_local_amount":6139.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96955146,"comment":null},{"amount":85,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:47:11Z","rounded_local_amount":4092.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103797947,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T14:04:16Z","rounded_local_amount":2046.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110689492,"comment":null},{"amount":170,"local_amount":8000,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:18:06Z","rounded_local_amount":8185.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123919388,"comment":null},{"amount":21.25,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:08:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1023.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128955081,"comment":null},{"amount":403.75,"local_amount":19000,"processed_date":"2010-04-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:01:33Z","rounded_local_amount":19440.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136683642,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

He is happy being a farmer and enjoys it very much and, following the example of his father, he plants and then his wife or son take the products to the market to sell.  Rahmatullo also raises and sells cattle. Farming gives Rahmatullo good earnings. He tells us that you only need to know how to take care of what you plant and to pay attention to what the crops need. As such, he fertilizes so that he has a good harvest. This is his second loan with Kiva partner IMON International and he is responsible with his payments. He plans to purchase high-quality seeds, mineral fertilizer and also young cattle. Rahmatullo is very grateful to everyone who is helping him to achieve his goals with this loan.  \r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

is a humble mother who, with much effort, works on her potato and wheat farm to later sell her agricultural products in the markets of the closest towns or to merchants from the same area. Her responsibilities as a mother have encouraged her to pursue farming activities to continue growing the best vegetables in the area. <P>\r\n\r\nTinik is also engaged in the business of raising and selling cattle.

Let\u2019s help this mother to keep working for the well-being of her family. <P>\r\n\r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n<P>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Askar is 26 years old. He is married with two small children. Askar has been a farmer since he was young. He plants potatoes and other vegetables. Askar alternates the crops so that while one is growing, the other is ready to be cleaned and prepared until he finally begins to plant potatoes again. <P>\r\n\r\nGrowing potatoes is very profitable because there are certain seasons when prices are higher and farmers have the opportunity to increase their capital. Currently Askar needs funds for growing his crop, and for that reason he applied to IMON International with the request for a 900 USD loan. He will spend this loan for buying potato seeds and fertilizer. This will be his first loan with IMON International, and his evaluation shows he is qualified to receive the loan.  <P>\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is married to a customs officer, and her business allows her, among other things, to contribute financially to the care of her family. She began this business in 1982; it is thus a field which she has mastered perfectly thanks to the length of experience already in her favour. With time, she was able to find out from her customers that she could also successfully sell different types of fabric, jewelry, and pearls. It is for this reason that she is seeking a loan through WAGES (one of Kiva's field partners) to buy a bale of fabric; at the same time, this loan will serve to buy pearls and jewelry of varying quality.

It is for this reason that this lady decided to begin selling second-hand clothing. She walks from house to house and has built up a faithful clientele. Thus, every time a new bale of clothing is opened, she reserves the best skirts and outfits for her most faithful clients, which increases her bonds with her customers each time. Currently, she urgently needs to send out a new order; this is why she is seeking a loan through WAGES (one of Kiva's field partners) to buy 5 bales of second-hand clothing. <br

Quingeo's most well-known festivals include Carnaval, because of its various events including the Capul\u00ed Queen's event and many more.  It is one of the most beautiful areas outside of Cuenca city. \r\n\r\nAll of the members of Quingeo Communal Bank migrated to their current location from the city, in search of better days for their families.\r\n\r\nManuela Q. V. is a Quingeo parish native, and she is a member of the Communal Bank of the same name.  She migrated to the area from Cuenca city two years ago to find a better future for her family.  She lives in the open market sector.  Manuela is 49 years old, she is married, and has 8 children.  She does not remember the ages of her two oldest children, but they are both married and live with their respective families.  She also has two young children, 9 and 6 years old, who live with her at home in Quingeo and their older sister takes care of them.  The children also live in a rented home with Manuela's husband in the city, because he works in a small kiosk that he owns and with which he helps pay for the expenses they have at home.\r\n\r\nManuela has been selling vegetables in the open market for two years now and it has gone very well, especially on Wednesdays, Saturdays, and Sundays when she gets her vegetable deliveries and resells them all around the market.  She is happy because Cuenca municipality has helped her obtain a post inside the market so she can work from one place and she no longer has to walk around anymore.\r\n\r\nThis is her first loan and one of her friends introduced her to the group because she too had improved her economic situation through a loan.

They each help their family, and when her husband cannot find work, he helps her with her business.\r\n\r\nRosario sells vegetables, grains, onions, and more in the open market.  She has been selling goods since she was young, and she thanks God that her business has done well.  She sells the most on Saturdays and Sundays, but regardless, every day she sells from 6am to 6pm, and days when she does traveling sales to markets farther away, she leaves at 4am so that she can claim a stall in those markets.\r\n\r\nThis is Rosario's first loan, and a friend invited her to be part of the group.  With the money FUNDACION ESPOIR is giving her, she will invest in the purchase of her own permanent stall in the market as well as buying more grain and growing her business.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to save enough money to buy her own car or plot of land.\r\n\r\nCarmen Rosa D.

She has a great relationship with her spouse, who works with scrap metal and helps her pay for all of their household expenses.\r\n\r\nCarmen works as a server in a restaurant inside the open market; she has been doing this for four years, and it has gone very well for her because she has great bosses who have special affection for her.\r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with FUNDACION ESPOIR; a friend

The majority of the members are from the neighborhood of Narancay from the Ba\u00f1os parish in the City of  Cuenca.  Ba\u00f1os is known for its hot springs that emanate from a volcano.  There are festivals throughout the month of January with several activities such as dances and artist showcases and festivals featuring timbulo (a sweet tamale wrapped in corn leaf) and other foods.  Few of the inhabitants work in agriculture because, for the most part, they work serving the large quantity of tourists who come to get to know this beautiful place.\r\n\r\nThe members tell their stories with characteristic friendliness.  Se\u00f1ora Mar\u00eda Natividad P. T. is a member of the Las Lucecitas bank.  She lives in Narancay, some 15 minutes outside the City of Cuenca.  She is 39 years old, married, and has 5 children, aged 18, 16, 14, 12, 1.  Her older children study in the Manuel C\u00f3rdova Galarza Technical College located in her parish.  She and her family live in their own home, the fruits of the efforts of Se\u00f1ora Mar\u00eda and her spouse.  Her husband is a carpenter, and he is the best life partner, as well as the best example for their children.  For 10 years Mar\u00eda has worked in agriculture, raising chickens, guinea pigs, and pigs.  The family consumes the majority of her output, and she sells a small amount in the free market in Cuenca, also selling chickens on foot, or plucked to acquaintances who buy in the house; she also sells them in the stores in her area.\r\n\r\nThis is her third loan cycle with the foundation and she is grateful because they have helped stabilize her economically because before she had to borrow from informal lenders at very high rates of interest.  With the loan that the ESPOIR foundation is granting her, she will buy more chickens, guinea pigs, pigs, animal food and vitamins to continue to grow her business.  Her goal is to eventually buy a car in order to increase her sales and collect more customers. \r\n\r\nSe\u00f1ora Mar\u00eda Cristina Mej\u00eda P. is a new member of the communal bank.  Her mother-in-law is a member of the bank and invited her to become a member. She lives in the community of Guzho, some 15 minutes outside the City of Cuenca.  She is 23 years old, has been married for 5 years, and has two children: a 4-year old and a 2-year old.  Her husband is a driver in public transportation.  Maria is starting with the business of raising chickens.  She tells us that it is not too complicated, to obtain the desired earnings you just have to be attentive so that the animals do not lack food or water and have adequate shelter so that they do not die.  This is her first credit with the ESPOIR foundation and she hopes to continue to take out loans so that she can improve her quality of life and that of her family.  With this loan she will purchase more chickens, animal food and vitamins, and also she will use a part of the loan to finish her house.  The goal of Maria is to finish her house with the loans that the foundation grants.\r\n\r\nSe\u00f1ora Sindy Gissela Mor\u00e1n C. is another active member of the communal bank Las Lucecitas.  She lives in the City of Cuenca, is eighteen years old, and is married.  Although she has no children, she has a solid matrimonial relationship, telling us that in order to have a consistent relationship one must be friends above all and have excellent communication. Her husband is an electrician and they live in a rented home and would like to improve their economic situation.  Sindy sells shoes, she has been involved in this activity for a year and it's going very well because she has a good supply of good quality shoes.  She is an informal trader in the Cuenca free market, which runs daily.  She works from 8am to 6pm and on weekends goes to the markets in Sigsig, Azogues, and Paute where she works from 5 a.m. to 6 p.m.  This is her first loan, a friend convinced her to become part of the bank by telling her about the advantages that the foundation offers.  With the loan she is requesting she will buy more merchandise and this way will have an increased inventory of shoes for women, men and children.  Her dream is to have her own stall, so that she would not have to travel around the city to sell her goods.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva

Her daughter comes to the stand to help Ida with sales.  \r\n\r\nIn the future, Ida would like to expand her business  in order to increase her income for her family.  This is her ninth loan with MFP.  She always has been very punctual with her payments and commits to continue being so.  She will use the money she is asking for to buy a larger quantity of merchandise to increase her business' sales.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Colleen  Godfrey, Kiva

She lives with her husband, Salvador, who is 50, and their two sons, Juan, 18, and Frank, 14.  Five years ago, she decided to start a business which she would be able to operate at home, allowing her to take care of her children, who were school aged and needed her help. As a result, she took advantage of the large space available in her home and established a car parking facility, which currently has room for 6 or 7 cars. Her business is profitable and does not take much time, which is very convenient for her. However, Mar\u00eda has recently been thinking about starting another type of business parallel to her current one, such as the sale of natural health products to customers in their homes, which she will undertake in her spare time. Her goal is to save enough money to open a bookstore in the space that she is now using as a garage. She knows that she still has a long way to go toward this goal, but she will not give up her hope of making it a reality soon. \r\n\r\nThis is Mar\u00eda's ninth loan with MFP. She and her group have always shown themselves to be very responsible and punctual in their payments, and this is something that makes Mar\u00eda very happy. With the funds she is requesting, she will purchase natural health products so that she can begin selling and distributing them to customers in their homes. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish

Her husband works in construction applying stucco; they get along very well as a married couple as they help each other with household expenses. They do not own a house and for that reason they live in a house that they have barrowed from a brother. \r\n<P>\r\nJulia is a seamstress; she learned this trade by herself. For the past five years she has worked on order making pants, suits, jackets, skirts, etc. Because she works at home she does not have a fixed work schedule but almost everyday she works from 9am to 12pm, and from 2pm until the late hours in the evening given that she has to share her time with household chores. \r\n<P>\r\nThis is her third loan cycle working with the foundation; she feels very thankful because thanks to the loans that she has been granted she has been able to repair two sewing machines and to purchase an iron. \r\n<P>\r\nWith this loan that she has acquired she will obtain a gas stove that she is missing. \r\n<P>\r\nHer goal is to study how to cut and fashion clothing to earn a tailor title. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mariela Cedeno, Kiva

a mother, Mrs. Delia G. has always aspired to provide well for her children's future. But in Sitio Cambagting, Barangay Cabacungan, La Castellana, the village where they lived, employment opportunities were scarce. Her husband, Edmond, earned a minimum daily wage as a truck driver, which was not enough to feed their 10 children. Despite of all the adversities that her family faced, Delia strived hard to supplement her husband's income and provide for her large family. Her skills as a cook inspired her to start a food vending business and offer home-cooked meals to her neighbors. \r\n\r\nWith virtually no capital, she started her business by cooking 3 to 4 dishes in small quantities, and putting all of her income back into her business. As demand for her cooked food grew among her neighbors, it became obvious that she needed a larger revolving fund. This moved her to join NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2001, and with the additional capital from her loans, she was able to increase her food production in volume and variety. \r\n\r\nNow that she is 58 and her husband is 65, their life has improved. Nine of her children have their own families, some earning their own living and some help in her food vending business. Only the youngest still attends school. Her husband's income as a truck driver and the PHP 3,000.00 she nets from her food business is enough to cover their household expenses.\r\n\r\nFor her 13th loan, she borrowed PHP 10,000. She used some of the loan funds for her food vending business, and she used some to buy a piglet that she can raise in her backyard and later sell for a profit. That loan has been repaid in full and she never missed an installment. \r\n\r\nShe is now borrowing PHP 17,000 for her 14th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. She intends to invest the loan funds in her food vending business. \r\n\r\nIn the picture, Delia is standing in front of her food stall with her daughter, who helps her in the business.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":389282,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"Additional capital for her food vending business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"La Castellana, Negros Occidental","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":145,"posted_date":"2009-09-18T03:30:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Delia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":17000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":680},{"due_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":680},{"due_date":"2009-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":680},{"due_date":"2009-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":680},{"due_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":680},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":680},{"due_date":"2009-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":680},{"due_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":680},{"due_date":"2009-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":680},{"due_date":"2009-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":680},{"due_date":"2009-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":680},{"due_date":"2009-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":680},{"due_date":"2009-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":680},{"due_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":680},{"due_date":"2009-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":680},{"due_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":680},{"due_date":"2009-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":680},{"due_date":"2009-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":680},{"due_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":680},{"due_date":"2010-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":680},{"due_date":"2010-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":680},{"due_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":680},{"due_date":"2010-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":680},{"due_date":"2010-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":680},{"due_date":"2010-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":680}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":3400,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T00:31:27Z","rounded_local_amount":3611.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87088378,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":3400,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T04:06:30Z","rounded_local_amount":3611.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97004126,"comment":null},{"amount":60,"local_amount":2720,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:08:50Z","rounded_local_amount":2888.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103848900,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":3400,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:00:23Z","rounded_local_amount":3611.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110739567,"comment":null},{"amount":60,"local_amount":2720,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:15:04Z","rounded_local_amount":2888.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118128996,"comment":null},{"amount":30,"local_amount":1360,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:54:07Z","rounded_local_amount":1444.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123965791,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-09-18T18:27:34Z","paid_date":"2010-03-15T10:54:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":137624,"name":"Deng","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"C. is 24 years old and has been selling fresh fish in the busy local market for more than nine years.

It requires patience, hard work, love and dedication to achieve any semblance of success. \r\n\r\nMrs. Marissa B., 44 years old, is married to Mr. Joseph Maximo B. who helps her in running the business. They are blessed with 4 children, the oldest is 21 years old and the youngest is 12 years old. They live in the village of Brgy. Canmoros, in the town of Binalbagan, Negros Occidental. \r\n\r\nMr.& Mrs. B. wakes up at 4:00 AM each day to buy fish from the wholesalers. They deliver the fish to their permanent customers in the village and in the surrounding community. For 9 years, Marissa also has been engaged in selling dried fish, Ginamos nga Isda (Fermented Salted Fish), and other Sea Food products. Because of her dedication, hard work and perseverance, she and her husband were able to reach their goal to send their children to school, build their house in stages while maintaining their good credit record with NWTF-Project Dungganon.\r\n\r\nAt present, the 2 older children have already finished vocational courses but each would like to continue their education and earn a bachelor's degree. While waiting for the next school year to start, so they could enroll and start attending college, they are earning their own income by selling fish in another fish stall in the market. Delia saves their profits in a fund for their college tuition.\r\n\r\nDelia is grateful for the continued support she gets from NWTF-Project Dungganon through the loans she borrows at easy installment payments. Her previous 12th cycle loan amounting to PHP 12,000 was fully paid on time and she is now borrowing PHP 12,000. This will be her 13th cycle loan that she will have a revolving working capital for her fish vending business.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":389093,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish

However, due to high competition, she has been acquiring greater amounts of eggs which has helped increase her earnings, albeit very slowly. Her plans are to invest more in her business through the purchase of additional product to sell. That is the reason that Inoyat applied for a loan of 3000 Somoni. With your support, you can improve the quality of life for Inoyat and her family and help their business grow and prosper.   \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule.

His restaurant is located near a big factory that allows him to attract a large number of clients, especially at lunch time. Narzi wants this loan inorder that he may invest in more products to offer a more varied selection of dishes. He is asking for a loan of $1200 USD.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Tuya is 43 years old and lives with her husband and three children in the Chingeltei district of Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia's capital city. Her oldest son, Ganga, has lived and studied in Japan for the past six years, while her younger two daughters attend university and high school in Mongolia. Her husband works as carpenter in a small wooden-products factory in the city.  Tuya operates a jeans-selling business out of two rented stalls at a popular indoor market and trade center. She has a shop assistant who helps her operate both stalls. She also supplements her income by working as a Mongolian language teacher at a center for foreign nationals. \r\n\r\nTuya started her jeans business in 2001 and has had much success. Today, her profits average between 400,000 - 500,000 tugrugs per month. She attributes her success to her good management and accounting practices.

Mercy thanks you for your support!\n\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":389860,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To open the same business at new location","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbozi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.75 32.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-10-01T13:40:20Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mercy ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":800000,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.16},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.16},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:33:22Z","rounded_local_amount":135833.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97023064,"comment":null},{"amount":104.16,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:45:34Z","rounded_local_amount":135833.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103868305,"comment":null},{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:45:45Z","rounded_local_amount":135833.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757501,"comment":null},{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:35:02Z","rounded_local_amount":135833.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146595,"comment":null},{"amount":104.16,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:16:39Z","rounded_local_amount":135833.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123984740,"comment":null},{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":133333.35,"processed_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:01:22Z","rounded_local_amount":135833.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129015413,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-10-01T19:37:34Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:01:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":137672,"name":"Enhtsetseg","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Enhtsetseg L. is a widow with three daughters in ages ranging from 13 to 18.

G., 55 years old and from Tala, Caloocan City, believes that early training in classical music is a form of immunization and a mode to create healthy, secure individuals.<P>\r\n\r\nEvelyn (and her husband Angelito in photo)  is a music enthusiast.  Fifteen years ago, they started making engineered instruments, initially violins made of tropical wood which is bountiful in their forest-like village.  They also offer repair services for run-down violins and other stringed instruments, restoring them to sound great again, just like a Stradivarius or a Guarnerius.  Later, most of their violin clients asked for saxophones and other brass instruments.  Evelyn says the net income from their violin shop now reaches at least P20,000 a month.  <P>\r\n\r\nEvelyn says they have even gotten more clients since she joined the Center for Community Transformation (CCT) Credit Cooperative in 2006.  From their profit, this husband and wife team has already put up a small store selling school supplies and looks forward to venturing into other businesses as well.<P>\r\n\r\nEvelyn now needs a new loan in the amount of P22,000 to purchase raw materials needed for the production of violins.  She has dreaming of putting up a showroom for their crafts in a mall or any commercial center.

I. is from the village of Lower Tiparak, Tambulig, Zamboanga del Sur. He is 33 years old. Marciano is married and has 4 school-aged children. To make a living, Marciano owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops. While not the only means of generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from planting and harvesting rice for sale. Marciano has been engaged in his business for over 8 years and earns approximately 7000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Marciano joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Marciano successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings and young crops to raise. Marciano is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP that will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Marciano from GDMPC. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of his family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.
