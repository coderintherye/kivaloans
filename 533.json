She earns her living by raising hogs, buying and selling rope, and with a veterinarian business. Her husband, Ricardo, age 44, works as a fisherman. They have four children who are between 11 and 21 years old. \r\n\r\nAlmira joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she wanted something better for her family. With the help of her past 12 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, and by the sweat of her brow, Almira has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty. Her previous loan of 25,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of 6,500 PHP, improving the family's standard of living. This time, for her 13th loan, she is borrowing 29,500 PHP, which she intends to use to buy medicines and vaccines for her hogs and paraphernalia so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Almira is a <i>Dungganon<\/i> woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means <u>honorable<\/u>).

This loan will be the 6th loan taken out by Maria from HSPFI.

J. is a 24-year-old mother who dreams for the betterment of her family. She is from Villar, Sibalom, Antique, Philippines.  She is married to Orlee J. and they are blessed with two children: Gwen Ashley \u2013 five years old, and Steven \u2013 two years old.\r\n\r\nIn order to provide for their family's basic needs, they work very hard to earn an income. Rosenie is engaged in hog fattening while her husband works as a driver and a fish vendor.  With their limited income, Rosenie tries to budget for her family's needs, repay her loans, and also keep a little savings for their future needs.  She has started personal savings through the initiative of ASHI.\r\n \r\nShe joined ASHI in 2010 and has fortunately already fully repaid her first loan.  She is requesting PHP 9000.00 for her second loan. This amount will be used for her piggery project.  These projects really help them address the big and unexpected expenses for their family.\r\n\r\nRosenie's greatest dreams are to give her children the right education and to have their own house and lot.  If she has access to a bigger loan in the future, she wants to open up a variety store to earn extra income.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":697557,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To use for

is a married woman who lives in Pulupandan, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating a business selling fish and seafood.  Her husband Rafael D. Jr., who is 33 years old, works as a fish vendor to earn income.  He also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have 2 children who are 7 months and 5 years old. \r\n\r\nRachelle joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 5 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Rachelle has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 10000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 6th loan, she is borrowing PHP 13000, which she intends to use to purchase more stock to sell so that she can continue to save for the future education of her children. \r\n\r\nRachelle is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She has been engaged in her business for over 9 years and earns approximately $125 a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Tesie joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. \r\n\r\nTesie is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell like snack foods and canned goods. This will be her 2nd loan from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":697723,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase additional products to sell like snack foods and canned goods","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Yumbing, Mambajao, Camiguin","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":128,"posted_date":"2011-01-21T12:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tesie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-01-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2011-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2011-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2011-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2011-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2011-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2011-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2011-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2011-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2011-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2011-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2011-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2011-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2011-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2011-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2011-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2011-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":400}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":20,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:52:31Z","rounded_local_amount":889.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191435138,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":1600,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:48:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1779.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195854247,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":1600,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:15:38Z","rounded_local_amount":1779.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201296108,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":1600,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:13:31Z","rounded_local_amount":1779.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206164392,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:26:10Z","rounded_local_amount":2224.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211237000,"comment":null},{"amount":10,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:14:40Z","rounded_local_amount":444.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216515643,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-01-21T14:16:42Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T11:14:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":267136,"name":"Uugantsetseg","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Uugantsetseg is 46 years old and lives with her husband in the Suhbaatar district of Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC, and communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi.

The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is 40 years old.  Jeanne is single and has 2 school-aged children.  To make a living, Jeanne owns and operates a specialized retail store.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling coconuts for copras in the local community.  Jeanne has been engaged in her business for over 6 years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Jeanne joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Jeanne has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory & working capital. Jeanne is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional coconuts for copras to sell. This loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by Jeanne from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the borrower's business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

She runs a small store selling candies and sweets. The store is located on the first floor of a big apartment building which provides easy access for her clientele. She has been in this business for 6 years. \r\n\r\nRuzijon is very cheery and optimistic. Her store faces high competition as there are many supermarkets in the neighborhood. However, her customer-friendly service and the individual attention she can give help her keep loyal customers. Her responsibility and perseverance have helped Ruzijon repay all loans she has received from IMON International successfully. \r\n\r\nRuzijon is requesting a loan of $1500 US for a couple of purposes. She is going to do some remodeling work inside her vending facility and she\u2019d like to increase the assortment of products she has available. This loan will help Ruzijon expand her business, having a positive impact on her trade profitability, and helping to further improve the economic and social situation of her family.  \r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC, and communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Lolita has been engaged in her business for over 2 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Lolita joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Lolita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to repair a transport vehicle used in the business. Lolita is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to purchase tools needed for the maintenance of the service. This will be the 3rd loan taken out by Lolita from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is an accredited partner of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

R. is from the village of Duka, Medina, Misamis Oriental. She is 59 years old. Juliet is married and has 3 adult-aged children. To make a living, Juliet owns and operates a specialized retail store. The main source of income for the business comes from buying and selling coconuts for copras (dried coconut) in the local community. Juliet has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Juliet joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Juliet has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional coconuts and increase working capital. Juliet is requesting a new loan of 11,000 PHP that will be used to purchase additional coconuts for copras. This loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by Juliet from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

The loan consultant who has been working with Viviana and her family over the years describes her as a hardworking and entrepreneurial person who has goals and plans. Viviana and her husband work as a team and make decisions together. \r\n\r\nThe main business obstacle Viviana faces is the slow rotation of inventory. To address this, she is beginning a publicity campaign and offering promotional deals to her customers. One of Viviana\u2019s long-term goals is to open an internet caf\u00e9.

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Eden E. is from the village of Nagrumbuan, Cauayan City, Isabela. She is 56 years old. Eden is the group leader of a 5-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nEden is married and has one school-aged child. To make a living, Eden owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector running a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food and daily use products in the local community. Eden has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Eden joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Eden has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Eden is requesting a new loan of 13000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and working capital. This loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by Eden from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the borrower's business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":697575,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She is 50 years old. Harselina is the group leader of a 9-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nHarselina is married and has two adult-aged children. To make a living, Harselina owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector running a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food & daily use products in the local community. Harselina has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 4500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Harselina joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Harselina has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Harselina is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and working capital. This loan will be the 4th loan taken out by Harselina from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the borrower's business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2050,"image":{"id":697585,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability.  While a typical pasal might be no more than 100 sq. feet, they are always full of bargaining customers, incoming produce, and shrewd businesswomen.

With these she earns around Php 7,000 monthly. \r\n\r\nTo help her grow her business, Janete decides to apply for a Php 9,000 loan. She plans to use the money to level up her water business, as well as to boost up her e-load business.

To make a living, Violeta owns and operates a business venture in the manufacturing sector operating a furniture making business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from making and selling general household furniture to local businesses and community members. Violeta has been engaged in her business for over seven years and earns approximately 3000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Violeta joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Violeta is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and working capital. This loan will be the 1st loan taken out by Violeta from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

They live in Dasmarinas, Cavite, where they raise their four children. One of them is in college while another one is in elementary. They have a child who already works for a living, and one who stays at home.\r\n\r\nPetronila is a dealer of charcoal and wood as cooking fuel, applying her learning from the training CCT* provides to its community partners. She buys sacks of it and repacks it into small packs worth Php 10. This she does to make it affordable to people in her community who often use it for cooking. With these, she earns an estimated net income around Php 10,000 every month.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she would like to apply for a Php 8,000 loan. She plans to use this to buy more sacks of charcoal and bundles of woods as fuel to boost her business. She looks forward to an increased income due to this effort.\r\n\r\nCustomers and financial matters will always be a concern for her, but Petronila knows that God has given her the ability to produce wealth; the first step is to believe, and the next one is to take action.

He sees that this kind of business is profitable in his community, where people do not yet have their own cars to use. Aside from that, Ireneo also has an ice cream business located near their home. He earns an estimated income of around Php1,000 per day.\n\nTo help him continue operation of his business, he is requesting for a Php15,000 loan. He notices that an improvement has to be done in his shop. Part of the loan, then, will go to this purpose. As a Community Partner, he also continuously applies what he learns from CCT* to make this business grow, along with his ice cream business.\n\nIreneo presently struggles with coming up with new ideas for his business. He sees that if he has to keep up with the times, he has to give his business a new look.

one would dream for one\u2019s self or one\u2019s family, why not dream for the best? Gertruda R., 34, dreams for the best, but more than that, she acts to make it a reality. Ruby, as she is called by friends, reached college and is married to Joseph Ryan, a general manager. They have a child who is in elementary school. Together they live in Pasay City.\r\n\r\nWith the learning she gains as a Community Partner in CCT*, Ruby runs her own sari-sari (variety) store to capitalize on the big target market she has in her community. She has been doing business here for two years. It is quite easy for her since it is a residential business, and there is not much need at present to hire employees. She earns Php800 a day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she would like to request for a Php15,000 loan. This she plans to buy more grocery items to put in her store, so that it would not have to look bare and incomplete. Ruby takes effort to maintain her business in good shape, because a profitable business translates to family needs being met and the schooling of her child being supported. \r\n\r\nRuby struggles with time management when it comes to balancing business, health and family life. One proof of this is her health problem. However, she sees to it that these struggles will not prevent her from reaching her dreams for her family. She desires to see her small store grow and eventually expand. She dreams of good health for everyone in the family, having their own house and lot, and permanent job for her husband, and a big happy family. Deep inside, she knows that if there is faith, and action, it will be possible.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance

At the age of 32, Remelita, as she is called by friends, learns the ways of both business and life to get going at a better pace. She finished only 2nd year high school, but her training in CCT as a Community Partner enables her to run a business with confidence. She is married to Marco Antonio, a driver.  They used to live in Cebu City, but now they reside in Maricaban, Pasay City, with their three children. One of them is already in college, while the two others are in elementary.\r\n\r\nRemelita has been in the direct selling for two years, but is still doing her best to master her trade. She tries to figure out what her customers like when it comes to bags, shoes, shirts, and pants. With no employees to help her sell, she gives her utmost strength to make her business work. She earns an estimated net income of around Php3,000 per month.\r\n\r\nTo help her grow her business, Lita applies for a Php15, 000 loan. She will use this money to buy quality apparel to make sure that her customers will get only the best in the market. With this money on hand, she can easily improve on her business, one lesson she got in her fellowship* with fellow community partners.\r\n\r\nJust like any micro entrepreneur, Remelita also suffers from customers who do not pay their debts. But as she is learning how to be a successful entrepreneur, she also learns how to deal with such difficult times in business.

She will use this to buy goods that her customers prefer. She will see to it that her store will not lack any valuable thing that her customers need, so that they will make her their number one sari-sari store in the community.  She also plans to use part of this loan to purchase needed materials for her burger stand.\r\n\r\nLina learns the value of improving one\u2019s business, and thus works to innovate her own.

To make a living, Ligaya owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector running a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap & toothpaste in the local community. Ligaya has been engaged in her business for over 20 years and earns approximately 3000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Ligaya joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Ligaya has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Ligaya is requesting a new loan of 7000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand product offering. This loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by Ligaya from ASKI.

To make a living, Agnes owns & operates a business venture in the arts sector operating a handicraft business.

Agnes has successfully repaid a previous loan of 15000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional handicrafts to sell. Agnes is requesting a new loan of 12000 PHP which will be used to purchase raw materials to make additional handicrafts. This loan will be the 4th loan taken out by Agnes from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the borrower's business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

The earned income helps her to put three meals a day on the table for her family.   \r\n\r\nShe has applied for a loan from the Kiva partner, Asasah, for her animals sales business. With the loan she will buy goats and buffalo and raise them up for selling. She is hopeful that this investment will be profitable for her business and will increase her household income as a result. She also has a plan to collect some dowry for her elder daughter\u2019s marriage with the help of increased profits. \r\n\r\nShe is a regular loan user of Asasah and this is her 5th loan application. In previous loan years, she has maintained good credit behavior and never missed any meeting. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":698474,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy animals (goats & buffalo) for animal sales business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PK","country":"Pakistan","town":"Kasur","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"31.115556 74.446667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":60,"posted_date":"2011-01-22T12:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Guddu ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-01-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PKR","disbursal_amount":50000,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":4550},{"due_date":"2011-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4550},{"due_date":"2011-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":4550},{"due_date":"2011-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":4550},{"due_date":"2011-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":4550},{"due_date":"2011-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":4550},{"due_date":"2011-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":4550},{"due_date":"2011-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":4550},{"due_date":"2011-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":4550},{"due_date":"2011-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":4550},{"due_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":4500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.6},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.6},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.6},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.6},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.6},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.6},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.6},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.6},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.6},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.6},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":54.6,"local_amount":4550,"processed_date":"2011-02-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:18:37Z","rounded_local_amount":4676.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195791060,"comment":null},{"amount":54.6,"local_amount":4550,"processed_date":"2011-03-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:15:51Z","rounded_local_amount":4676.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201232931,"comment":null},{"amount":54.6,"local_amount":4550,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:14:18Z","rounded_local_amount":4676.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206099336,"comment":null},{"amount":54.6,"local_amount":4550,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:35:47Z","rounded_local_amount":4676.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211169739,"comment":null},{"amount":54.6,"local_amount":4550,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:35:43Z","rounded_local_amount":4676.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216452482,"comment":null},{"amount":54.6,"local_amount":4550,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:18:45Z","rounded_local_amount":4676.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221616437,"comment":null},{"amount":54.6,"local_amount":4550,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:26:52Z","rounded_local_amount":4676.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":226985566,"comment":null},{"amount":54.6,"local_amount":4550,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:21:11Z","rounded_local_amount":4676.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232744411,"comment":null},{"amount":54.6,"local_amount":4550,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:23:57Z","rounded_local_amount":4676.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238548896,"comment":null},{"amount":54.6,"local_amount":4550,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:17:25Z","rounded_local_amount":4676.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244507693,"comment":null},{"amount":54,"local_amount":4500,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:20:54Z","rounded_local_amount":4625.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250715369,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-01-22T17:00:54Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T09:20:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":267406,"name":"Soam","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Soam S., 51, is married and resides with her husband and four children in Kompong Chhnang Province, Cambodia; an area known for fertile farmland for growing rice crops.

Imelda has been engaged in her business for over 20 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Imelda joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Imelda has successfully repaid a previous loan of 13,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise. Imelda is requesting a new loan of 15000 PHP which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. This loan will be the 4th loan taken out by Imelda from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.
