At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nLejani owns a variety store. She buys groceries like canned goods, condiments, milk, and sugar: primary commodities that are needed in every household. She earns money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors in the local community. She earns a minimum of 300 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a 10,000 PHP loan.

She is married to Dante, and they live with their two children, ages 12 and 7, in a home they own. M\u00f3nica makes a living selling chicken. She gets up at dawn and goes to the farms where they raise chickens and where she can buy them at the lowest prices. She then takes them to her home and prepares them for sale. She has a table set up in front of her home for this task, cordially and amicably tending to her customers and selling clean, well-prepared chicken. Most of her customers are her neighbors, and she has served them for the past seven years. During all this time she has counted on the support of her husband during his free time, but generally she does the work alone. What she likes most about her work is being able to count on income that she can use to cover household expenses and the education of her children, for whom she loves deeply and wants to provide a better quality of life. What she doesn't like about her job is late payments by her customers when she sells on credit, but it does not discourage her and she is always on the lookout for good customers since they are the sustenance of her business. She has plans to build a shed and raise chickens there. This will be her first loan with Kiva partner MFP, and she is grateful to be able to count on the financial support so she can advance her business.

She lives with her common-law husband, Jos\u00e9, and their two children, ages 22 and 38, whom they love very much.  They live in their own house.  Elvira sells groceries out of a small store she opened in her home where she receives her neighbors who are her main customers.  She has been in business for six years and is very kind to her customers, since what she enjoys most about her work is being able to socialize with her friends.  She keeps busy and feels she is being productive while helping to cover household expenses, since her husband's income as an electric technician does not always cover costs.  Her business is profitable since she has been able to establish a regular customer base who consume her products regularly meaning inventory turnover is constant and earnings are good.  Her goal now is to keep the business running.  This will be her 8th loan through the MFP institution.  She is grateful for the support and hopes to be able to continue counting on it, and is committed to paying back the loan on time.  The 2,000 PEN loan will be used to buy essential goods to add to the store's inventory to continue

She is single and lives with her parents and 18-year-old brother, who is in school.  The parents own the home.  Rosmery sells different styles of women's clothing which are sent to her from the city of Lima by a friend so she saves on travel expenses.  She sells the clothing to friends and relatives who are her main customers, sometimes on an order basis, and has been in business for a year.  What she likes most about her work is that she has her own income and can cover personal expenses, also the fact that she has free time to do other things.  What she likes least about her business is lack of puntuality among some of her credit customers, but this does not affect her payments because she is very responsible.  She feels her business is profitable because she has a regular customer base and hopes to open a clothing store in the commercial area in downtown Pucallpa.  This is her first loan through the MFP institution.  She is grateful for the financial support so she can grow her business and is committed to paying the loan back on time so she can request more loans.  The 1,000 PEN loan will be used to buy women's clothing in bulk at lower prices to increase her earnings."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":239.89,"image":{"id":917087,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To buy women's clothing.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-11-14T09:00:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosmery ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":149.44},{"due_date":"2011-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":159.08},{"due_date":"2012-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":165.02},{"due_date":"2012-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":166.16},{"due_date":"2012-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":177.36},{"due_date":"2012-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":182.94}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.04},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.66},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.88},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.31},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.51},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.6}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":56.04,"local_amount":149.44,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:05Z","rounded_local_amount":151.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244622021,"comment":null},{"amount":121.54,"local_amount":324.1,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:17:51Z","rounded_local_amount":328.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245866,"comment":null},{"amount":62.31,"local_amount":166.16,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:31:57Z","rounded_local_amount":168.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263385896,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-11-18T05:45:22Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":357246,"name":"Elvie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elvie is aged 35 and married with three children.

She is single and lives with her parents and two younger bothers, ages 13 and 6.  They live in their own home.  Ziosi sells different styles of top quality men's clothing, which an aunt of hers in Lima sends every two weeks.  Most of her customers are friends and acquaintances and she sells on a cash or 10-day credit basis.  She also brings in clothing on an order basis and has been in business for two years.  She handles the selling aspect of business on her own.  What she likes best is having her own income to pay for her education and sometimes help her parents wtih household expenses, as well has having free time to study.  What she likes least is the lack of payment punctuality on the credit she gives some customers, but this has not interfered with her loan payment commitment.  She feels her business is profitable because she has a regular customer base comprised of colleagues, friends and relatives.  In the future she wants to open a clothing store in downtown Pucallpa.  This is her first loan through the MFP institution and she is grateful for the opportunity to grow her business.  She is committed to paying back the loan on time so she can have access to more loans.  The 1,300 PEN loan will be used to buy bulk clothing at lower prices so she can increase earnings."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":319.93,"image":{"id":917096,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To buy more clothing.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-11-14T09:20:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ziorsi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1300,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":194.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":206.86},{"due_date":"2012-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":214.57},{"due_date":"2012-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":216.06},{"due_date":"2012-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":230.63},{"due_date":"2012-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":237.55}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.74},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.56},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.53},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.1},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.7},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":74.74,"local_amount":194.33,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:42Z","rounded_local_amount":202.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244622023,"comment":null},{"amount":162.09,"local_amount":421.43,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:18:41Z","rounded_local_amount":438.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245868,"comment":null},{"amount":83.1,"local_amount":216.06,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:32:42Z","rounded_local_amount":224.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263385898,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-11-18T10:54:49Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":357254,"name":"Ayurzana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ayurzana is 42 years old and lives with his wife and two kids in a ger (Mongolia yurt) in Bayanhongor Province, Mongolia.

He now owns three counters and has one employee. <p>\r\n\r\nMeat prices will rise with the approach of winter, so Nyamaa needs to save some supplies in order to run his business successfully.  He is requesting a loan of 2,650,000 MNT to buy livestock.

For more then two years he has been working as a taxi driver and likes this business.

","en":"Gavkhar is 50 years old, married and has three children. Her two older sons work, one as a waiter and the other one as a grocery truck driver, while the youngest daughter is still in school. To be able to support her family, Gavkhar is raising cattle and sells produce at the market. She has started her business with 15,000 som (KGS) which she used to purchase cattle and has now expanded her herd to four calves. Additionally, Gavkhar makes pasta for the lagman (a traditional Kyrgyz dish of roasted meat and pasta) which she sells to the local grocery stores. According to the recipe, pasta for lagman has to be made and stretched out completely by hand. Gavkhar's business yields 20,000 som (KGS) monthly in profits and this allows her to cover all daily expenses as well as save money for her daughter's education. In order to grow her business Gavkhar has turned to \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" for a credit of 100,000 som (KGS) with which she plans to buy additional cattle for fattening and resale. Her family is planning to use the profits from the loan to purchase a car and open a taxi service in the near future.

He is single and lives with his parents. Vardan has a college degree in Engineering but he has never been able to work in his profession. Instead, for the last two years Vardan has been running a grocery delivery service.

Ghassan is the man shown in the photograph.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\n FATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

Margaret has requested a loan of 300000 Ugandan Shillings from MCDT SACCO, which she will use to buy more bananas, Irish potatoes and beans. The main business challenges for Margaret include seasonality and increasing prices of food. Her goals and aspirations for her business are to own a fully stocked restaurant and also to build rental rooms.  Margaret lives in a home that she owns; she doesn't have access to electricity and doesn't have access to piped water.  Her major monthly expenses include rent and school fees.

He lives in the city of Ijevan. He is divorced but is helping his ex-wife to raise and educate their children. After finishing his service with the army, Edik organized his own business: a store that sells women's, men's and children clothing, exercise gear, shoes, bags, office supplies and toys. His store is located in a rented space in the Ijevan central market. Edik purchases his goods in Yerevan or imports from neighboring countries. Edik thinks that there is a lot of demand for children clothing and toys, so he is focusing his inventory towards these goods. He also purchases large batches of office supplies before the start of each school year.\r\n\r\nEdik requires a loan of 1,000,000 dram to purchase a lot of women's and men's jackets and children snow suits.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":209.63,"image":{"id":917595,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To buy winter outerwear to resell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AM","country":"Armenia","town":"Ijevan","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"40 45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":146,"posted_date":"2011-11-15T19:30:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edik","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"AMD","disbursal_amount":1000000,"loan_amount":2625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":26360},{"due_date":"2012-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":27250},{"due_date":"2012-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":26250},{"due_date":"2012-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":28940},{"due_date":"2012-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":28470},{"due_date":"2012-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":28890},{"due_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":28900},{"due_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":29740},{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":29030},{"due_date":"2012-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":30980},{"due_date":"2012-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":31070},{"due_date":"2012-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":30850},{"due_date":"2012-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":32310},{"due_date":"2013-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":32160},{"due_date":"2013-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":32650},{"due_date":"2013-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":33970},{"due_date":"2013-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":33670},{"due_date":"2013-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":33940},{"due_date":"2013-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":35150},{"due_date":"2013-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":35440},{"due_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":35590},{"due_date":"2013-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":36500},{"due_date":"2013-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":37040},{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":37450},{"due_date":"2013-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":38140},{"due_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":38410},{"due_date":"2014-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":39350},{"due_date":"2014-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":39970},{"due_date":"2014-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":40400},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":41130}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.2},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.53},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.9},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.97},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.73},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.84},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.86},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.07},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.2},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.56},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.98},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.81},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.42},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.71},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.17},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.38},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.09},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.27},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.03},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.43},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.81},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.23},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":98.31},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.11},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.83},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.29},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.92},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.05},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.97}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":140.73,"local_amount":53610,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:31:54Z","rounded_local_amount":54044.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257263692,"comment":null},{"amount":68.9,"local_amount":26250,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:44:06Z","rounded_local_amount":26462.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263404880,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-16T17:17:21Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":357554,"name":"Kieu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kieu is married and 32 with two daughters.

is age 50 and married.

His farm currently produces milk, bananas and mangoes for the local market. He also runs a retail shop dealing in cereals.\r\n\r\nSilas made a loan request with Juhudi Kilimo amounting to 25,000 KES to purchase poultry birds and spread his risk from dairy farming, which has been his main source of income.
