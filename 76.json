With the present loan, she is thinking of improving her restaurant's accommodations to meet customer needs and to increase her income.  \r\n<p> <b>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<b><p>\r\n\r\nYawa N., mari\u00e9e et m\u00e8re de 04 enfants tous \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole est propri\u00e9taire d\u2019un restaurant \r\n D\u00e9nomm\u00e9 tantiD De fufu (Plat local) depuis 10 ans.

Setelah pembinaan dan pelatihan dirasa cukup maka Yayasan Dinari memberi pinjaman modal kepada anggota kelompok Merta Nadi.

During the farming season cattle are often used to help plow the farm fields in the community.  The profit she makes from her business is used to help improve the life of her family.

Setiap hari, mulai pukul 06.00 pagi, Ni Nengah Purnami memberi makan rumput yang sudah dipersiapkan kemarin sorenya. Sedang untuk siang hari dibiarkan di kebunnya untuk mencari makan sendiri. Menjelang malam hari, pukul 06.00 sore, diberi makan sekali lagi. Kegiatan ini dilakukan dengan harapan sapinya yang baru dibelinya tetap sehat. Persediaan pakan hijauan selalu tersedia dikebunnya.

Gafur, 35, lives in Varzob district.

B., 25, is married with two children.  She has a secondary school education.  Nazokat does not work outside the home, but raises milk cows as a side business.  She uses the milk for her own family and also sells to retailers.  Nazokat has been involved in this business for about five years.  She is applying for a loan to purchase another milk cow.  This will increase the volume of milk produced, increasing her income.  Additionally, Nazokat's business supplies the local markets with fresh milk.

But the rains have been heavy the last few months, causing some damage to the room and the wooden walls and now the renters are asking that she fixes it.

Their Bank of Hope is the first such group to be formed in their community of La Barquita and they are proud to be part of the new relationship between their community and Esperanza International.\r\n<p>\r\nRudilania is a 28 year old woman who lives with her husband. They have one daughter together but due to tough economic circumstances their daughter lives with her grandmother.\r\n<p>\r\nRudilania has asked for this loan to start a new business selling clothing. She plans to make a part of her small house a sales room and will travel around her neighborhood to market her new store.  Specifically, she is excited to begin selling new mens' and womens' jeans, as well as blouses and undergarments.  She will purchase the clothes from a market in Santo Domingo called Villa Consuelo, an area famous for high-quality, imported clothes at discount prices. Through the training she received from Esperanza, she learned that purchasing clothes at a wholesale discount, or at a small discount, substantially increases her profit margin, and consequently enables her to generate more income.  \r\n<p>\r\nHer biggest goal is to provide a better life for her daughter and give her what she herself never had growing up.  Her personal goal is to continue studying and to graduate from the medical school she has been studying at.  Rudilani is being trained in dialysis and blood work, as well as in providing vaccinations.  Her biggest challenges revolve around the lack of opportunity to improve her business and to work.  For the first time in a year and a half, Esperanza International is giving her the opportunity to return to work and create a stable income for her family.\r\n<p>\r\nIn her free time, she likes to spend as much time as she can with her daughter, as well as study, read, and go to her local church.

They have 3 children whom all of them have their own families now. Apart from the brown sugar making business, she is also a farmer. <p>\r\nNi Ketut and her husband use 20 coconuts\/ day for producing brown sugar. Her husband climbs the coconut tree twice a day to get these coconuts. In the afternoon, they slice the coconut to get the coconut juice as the main ingredients for the brown sugar. They keep the juice in bottles for a night and the next morning they put the juice in a big wok (cooking pan) and they steam the juice in the wok. This cooking process takes 3 hours. The juice becomes a bit of gel - like substance and they put these into the coconut shells that have been cut into half. Then they let these to cool down inside the coconut shells. <p>\r\nEveryday they can produce up to 6 kg of brown coconut sugar. The sugar is sold to regular customers who buy them once a week. The selling price is IDR 6 thousand per kg of sugar (around USD 0.65). In one month they can earn up to IDR 1,080,000 (around USD 118). <p>\r\nThe money from Dinari will be used to buy another 3 big woks. These woks cost around IDR 2.5 million (around USD   275). The rest of the money will be used to buy slicing knifes and 20 bottles. These production utensils are required to enable them to increase the production capacity. \r\n<p><b> Translated from Indonesian by Antonius Gunadi, Kiva Volunteer. <\/b><p>\r\n\r\nNi Ketut Suwadri dan suaminya, I Gede Suwendra, sudah lama menekuni usaha membuat gula merah.

Setiap hari suaminya memanjat pohon kelapa 2 kali . Sore hari,  untuk mengiris bakal buah yang masih muda supaya bisa keluar air gula, dan pada pagi hari menurunkan air gula yang ada pada jrigen. Setelah itu Ni Ketut Suwadri menaruhnya kedalam wajan yang besar dan direbus. Proses pembuatan gula merah hingga siap dicetak menghabiskan waktu 3 jam. Setelah adonan mengental, lalu dicetak kedalam tempurung kelapa yang sudah disiapkan. Setiap hari Ni Ketut Suwadri mampu memproduksi 6 kg gula merah. Ni Ketut Suwadri mempunyai pelanggan tetap yang setiap 1 minggu membeli gula merahnya. Harga 1 kg gula merah sekarang ini Rp. 6.000.- Setiap satu bulan dari penghasilan gula merah Ni Ketut Suwadri mendapat uang Rp.1.080.000,-. Modal yang dipinjam dari Dinari  untuk membeli 3 wajan besar yang harganya mencapai Rp. 2.500.000,-  sisanya untuk membeli pisau iris dan 20 jrigen.

M., 56, lives in Varzob district.  He is married with 5 children and has a secondary school education.  He works as a driver, but aside from that he also raises animals.  He buys young, healthy calves at local markets, fattens them for 40-45 days, and then sells them back at the same markets.  After selling these catlle, he then buys new ones, fattens them, and sells them again.  Bahrom has been buying and selling cattle in this manner for about 30 years.  This business brings additional income to his family, as well as supplying the local markets with fresh meat.  He is applying for a loan to increase turnover.  He plans to repay the loan within a year.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Susie Armitage, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\u041c\u0430\u0445\u043c\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0432

Davlatovich N. lives in the Abdurahmon Jomi region. He is 57 years old, is married and has 8 children. He has a specialized secondary education.  He is a professional driver and also is engaged in animal husbandry. He buys young calves, feeds them for 40-45 days and then sells them at higher price, since grown calves are cost more and are used for meat. He then buys another set of young calves, feeds them and resells them. This is his business, which helps him to provide for his family, since he is a sole breadwinner of the family.  Besides that, the development of stock-raising business allows to supply nearby markets with fresh meat at affordable prices. Safar has been in this business for about 20 years. He wants to use the proceeds of his loan to purchase several calves. He plans to repay his loan within 12 months.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Keith & Jamilya Leitich, Kiva Volunteers. <\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\u041d\u0443\u0440\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0435\u0432

Kodjo A. was born in 1982  in Lom\u00e9, where he continues to live. A bachelor, he opened a cafeteria-cafe, financed by his meager savings. So as to improve this endeavor, he is asking for a loan which will aid him in purchasing sufficient provisions for his cafeteria-cafe so as to run smoothly, such as milk, sugar, coffee, and eggs among others. With these provisions, he hopes to expand his current cafeteria-cafe into a restaurant, because his customer demand is very high. Completing this project will make it so that he does not have to go to the market every day, which leaves him more time to run his store and will result in higher revenue which he sorely needs to improve his daily standard of living. \r\n<p>Translated from French to English by Kiva Volunteer, Kristin Connor.<p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMonsieur A.

Realizing that TYM Fund policy was very suitable for her family conditions, from the beginning, she borrowed 60 USD to breed pigs. By using husks wasted from the husking machine as pig mash, her breeding plan became more effective and expanded. Currently, she has 18 pigs (about 1000 kg) ready to be released with an intended profit of 2000 USD. Besides, she is investing in making ice-cream machines, and general store, etc. Therefore, her family income is very stable. Her wish is to borrow more money to expand her breeding plan and other businesses, increasing family income. This time she wants to borrow 950 USD to buy pig mash and unhusked rice.

She was one among the first 5 members of TYM Fund in the area. She also encouraged other people to join the Fund. Her early plan was to invest in breeding pigs and work on rice field. However, since there was policy allowing people to exchange the rice field for other-purpose land, she bravely invested money and effort in transforming the land into the fish ponds and orchards. Her family income from the fish ponds in 2007 was approximately 3000 USD. Currently, her family is working on 3 rice fields, 4 fish ponds. Therefore, she is very busy at this time. However, she still manages to find some spare time to join activities of the area. She is elected to be the head of her living area. Her husband is very sympathetic with her work and is a great help to her.

When the agricultural expansion plan introduced to all provinces, Mrs. Gi\u1edbi has soon realized that that was a very rare opportunity. While other families might use their monies to build houses, she wisely used her money to invest in her farm. The investment brings her a handsome income. Currently she has a nice half acre farm which produces vegetable for the Hanoi\u2019s markets. The product impresses the Office of Agricultural Encouragement of the Department of Agriculture and the office endorses it as an agricultural model for the province. Recently she invested 1,500USD to purchase 500 grapefruit trees for her current project. This time she is applying for a loan of 950USD to purchase more fruit trees and fertilizer.  \r\n\r\n<p style=\"font-style: italic; font-size: 10px;\">Translated from Vietnamese by ngungo, Kiva volunteer.<\/p><br \/>  \r\n \r\nCh\u1ecb Ho\u00e0ng Th\u1ecb Gi\u1edbi, 38 tu\u1ed5i, s\u1ed1ng c\u00f9ng ch\u1ed3ng v\u00e0 2 con \u0111ang trong \u0111\u1ed9 tu\u1ed5i \u0111i h\u1ecdc t\u1ea1i M\u00ea Linh, V\u0129nh Ph\u00fac.

As they wait for the previous meeting to end, they greet each other with hugs and a chorus of \u2018buenos dias\u2019 and \u2018como estas\u2019, followed by excited chatter in their native language Kaqchiquel. As the other meeting lets out and the women begin to file in, the cream colored room becomes a canvas of brilliant colors, painted by the beautiful and intricate \u2018huipiles\u2019 (traditional woven blouses) that each woman wears.  \r\n\r\n<P>These huipiles are just one of many trades that the women practice. Among the eighteen, about half of them dedicate their time to weaving and sewing skirts (like the ones in the picture), scarves, purses, belts, ribbons that get woven into long braids, as well as huipiles. Ten of the 18 women are asking for a group loan of 26,000 quetzales ($3425), ranging from $150 to $400 per person, five of whom will invest in thread for their artisan business (one of them was not able to be present for the photo). Two women have jewelry businesses, making beaded bracelets, necklaces, rings and earrings that they sell in the nearby tourism capital Panajachel. Two women have small stores, selling soft drinks, snacks, chicken and sausages. And one woman, who could not be at the meeting because she was sick, has a tortiller\u00eda, and will invest in the ingredients necessary for making corn and flour tortillas.\r\n\r\n<P>The women of Mujeres Jardin have been with Friendship Bridge for two years, but have been together as a group much longer. They were previously with another institution, but were looking for a lower interest rate, which Friendship Bridge offers. They are more than happy with their new microfinance home, and are excited to see the long-term benefits for their business that less interest will bring. In addition to lower interest, one of their favorite things about Friendship Bridge is the education they receive\u2014they are learning how to better run their business, care for their family, and have a real hope for the future (and they like that they get to play games while they learn, too!)."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3425,"image":{"id":132572,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","use":"These women would

However, she noticed that her business was not able to support her family and her four small children.

But, she finds herself in a difficult position where she needs to ask for another loan in order to stock her fruits and vegetables, the larger quantity of products will mean more revenue and better support for her family. <p>Translated from Spanish to English by Kiva Volunteer, Kristin Connor.<p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align='justify'> \r\nLa  Se\u00f1ora Maria Elena P. se  dedica  a  la actividad  de  venta de frutas y verduras desde hace 23  a\u00f1os ubicada en el mercado La Terminal en Le\u00f3n.

colored by the wind and the sun they daily endure as they take care of their farms. <p>\r\nThey have traveled an hour from their community of Concepci\u00f3n, where the soil is rich and the climate good, allowing for year-round farming. All but two of the eighteen women have small farms, where they grow potatoes, carrots, onions, radishes, beans, broccoli, cauliflower, tomatoes, lemongrass, and chamomile (quite a variety!). <p>\r\nThey whisper to each other in their native language Kaqchiquel, eagerly awaiting approval of the loans they have requested. <p>\r\n\r\nEight of the women are asking for a group loan of 18,500 quetzales ($2425), ranging from $150 to $400 each. Of the eight, six will invest in seeds and fertilizer for their farms. <p>\r\nOne woman is an artisan, weaving beautiful \u2018huipiles\u2019, traditional Mayan blouses known for their intricate and colorful designs. She will invest in thread for her weavings. <p>\r\nAnother woman is a \u2018comerciante\u2019 (commerce women), buying a variety of goods in bulk and selling them at local markets. With her loan, she will buy a greater quantity of each item, lowering the price per item and increasing her profits. <p>\r\n\r\nEach woman of Mujeres Chuisequ\u00e9c has a family to take care of; some even have up to ten children. <p>\r\nThey express that everything they do is to improve the lives of their children so they can receive an education and learn to read and write. This will open them new opportunities and avoid them the suffering their mothers have had to endure. <p>\r\nAs they go to sign their names, all but two sign with a thumbprint, indicating they cannot write. But they sign with pride, knowing that with this loan they are doing everything in their power to give their children the right tools to learn and later on sign their names with a pen."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2425,"image":{"id":132595,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase seeds and fertilizer, as well as thread for weaving and goods in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Concepcion,  Solola","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.783333 -91.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":55,"posted_date":"2008-02-24T21:00:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marcela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zoida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Josefa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jorga","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Cristina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Manuela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Susana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-03-10T15:29:38Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":18500,"loan_amount":2425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2055.56},{"due_date":"2008-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2055.56},{"due_date":"2008-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2055.56},{"due_date":"2008-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2055.56},{"due_date":"2008-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2055.56},{"due_date":"2008-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2055.56},{"due_date":"2008-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2055.56},{"due_date":"2008-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2055.56},{"due_date":"2008-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2055.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":269.45},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":269.45},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":269.45},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":269.45},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":269.45},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":269.45},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":269.45},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":269.45},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":269.4}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":270,"local_amount":2059.79,"processed_date":"2008-04-10T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T04:07:16Z","rounded_local_amount":2062.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":178835,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":270,"local_amount":2059.79,"processed_date":"2008-05-10T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T04:08:09Z","rounded_local_amount":2062.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206389,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":270,"local_amount":2059.79,"processed_date":"2008-06-10T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T04:09:19Z","rounded_local_amount":2062.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":234226,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":270,"local_amount":2059.79,"processed_date":"2008-07-10T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T04:11:00Z","rounded_local_amount":2062.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":262942,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":270,"local_amount":2059.79,"processed_date":"2008-08-10T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T04:11:55Z","rounded_local_amount":2062.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":291818,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":270,"local_amount":2059.79,"processed_date":"2008-09-10T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-11-01T07:07:07Z","rounded_local_amount":2062.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322259,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":270,"local_amount":2059.79,"processed_date":"2008-10-10T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-11-22T08:05:50Z","rounded_local_amount":2062.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":354598,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":265.56,"local_amount":2025.95,"processed_date":"2008-11-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-19T09:03:49Z","rounded_local_amount":2028.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5315804,"comment":null},{"amount":269.44,"local_amount":2055.52,"processed_date":"2008-12-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-19T09:09:53Z","rounded_local_amount":2057.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9933985,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-02-25T16:29:38Z","paid_date":"2009-01-19T09:09:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":38049,"name":"Kieu Thi","description":{"languages":["vi"],"texts":{"vi":"Mrs. Ki\u1ec1u Th\u1ecb S\u01a1n, 27 years old, lives with her husband and a 6 years old S. in S\u00f3c S\u01a1n.

The women gather excitedly, talking rapidly in their native language K\u00b4iche\u00b4, while their children play in the folds of their dresses, giggling timidly.  These women are strong and have endured much, yet more than exhaustion they emit hope and joy.

A single huipil can take up to one month to make, and after an investment of about 200 Quetzales (about $25), they can sell it for about 500 Quetzales (about $60).  Currently, the women sell their huipiles in the nearby town of Nahuala, and they are well known in their community so customers also come directly to their home to make purchases.  \r\n\r\n<P>Of the 11 women, almost half can read and write, which is a very large percentage for the area.  They are smart in business, and are looking for new ways to expand.  They\u2019ve recognized the large number of sales that tourism brings in, and are hoping to implement an export business or connect with a nearby community where tourism is more prevalent than in their town and open a market there.   As a group they are asking for a loan of 33,500 Quetzales, about $4400, $400 per person, which they will invest in various colored threads to weave their huipiles.  A few of the women are also planning on using part of their loan to hire extra help so they can increase the rate of production and make more

He's looking for a way to solve the problem and he's applying to Ceprodel for a loan that will allow him [to withdraw from this debt for a solar panel?] so that he can use the power from it for household chores and provide light for his children to study.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva Volunteer<\/b><p>\r\nVicente L\u00f3pez por mas de 10 a\u00f1os se ha dedicado al negocio de agropecuario en la ciudad de Le\u00f3n espec\u00edficamente en la comunidad de Achuapa que es el lugar donde se ha criado desde peque\u00f1o.
