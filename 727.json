But he lacks the necessary capital, thus he wants to borrow PHP 25,000 to buy fertilizers, pesticides and corn seeds and to pay for the labour costs required to plant rice.  He believes that this loan will help him to make a growth in his business.  He is hoping that he will have a plenteous harvest to support his family's daily needs.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":931726,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy fertilizers, pesticides and corn seeds and to pay for the labour costs required to plant rice.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Naganacan,Cauayan City, Isabela","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":123,"posted_date":"2011-12-01T08:06:32Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rodolfo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":25000,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":575}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2011-12-20T21:46:38Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":364190,"name":"Amani Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Irene is the facilitator of the Amani group.

Patrick and his group joined One Acre Fund in the year 2011 and will re-enroll in the 2012 program.\r\n\r\nPatrick takes care of eight children at home.

In the recent 2011 season, Patrick had a very good maize yield harvesting 8 bags on \u00bd an acre of land. Before joining One Acre Fund,  Patrick was only able to harvest 4 \u00bd bags of maize on \u00bd an acre of land.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, One Acre Fund will purchase fertilizer, seeds, and other important inputs to distribute to Patrick and his group during Kenya\u2019s next planting season in February 2012. The distribution of farming inputs is part of One Acre Fund\u2019s integrated agriculture package, which includes training, reliable input supply (such as fertilizer and seeds), credit and insurance.\r\n\r\nWith income from maize sales, Patrick will educate his children and build a house in future.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, the members of Bidii Women group will each plant maize plots of between \u00bd and 1 acre of land.\r\n\r\nIn the photograph above, Patrick is pictured with his group members and standing on the far left is the field officer.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":931843,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To source farming inputs, such as seeds and fertilizer, at low prices for the 2012 planting season.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2011-11-28T16:40:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":850,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Agnes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gladys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margaret","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Belam","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Moses","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patrick ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zainab","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":76650,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76650}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":850}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2011-12-21T04:23:12Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":364267,"name":"Kimatullo","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u041a\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0443\u043b\u043b\u043e \u0436\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c \u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0414\u0430\u043d\u0433\u0430\u0440\u044b. \u0415\u043c\u0443 44 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430. \u0416\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0442. \u0418\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 \u0434\u0432\u043e\u0438\u0445 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u0411\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0435 15 \u043b\u0435\u0442 \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0442\u043e\u0440\u0433\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0435\u0439 \u0444\u0440\u0443\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u0438 \u043e\u0432\u043e\u0449\u0435\u0439. \u041a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0431\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0442 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0437\u0430\u043a\u0443\u043f\u0430 \u043e\u0432\u043e\u0449\u0435\u0439 \u0438 \u0444\u0440\u0443\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0432.\n\n","en":"Kimatullo is a resident of the Dangara region.

Djumakan grew up in a big family with three brothers and two sisters. Her parents were ordinary workers. After graduating from high school, Djumakan helped the family on the farm and since childhood she has had tremendous experience working with domestic livestock and crops. The family's main source of income was growing beets, and there was no question of her having access to higher education. She married a fellow villager, and the young family began working in the fields, planting beets. \r\n\r\nLiving in her home village became harder and harder.  There was no work--all of them men could only work farming poultry and sugar beets, and by the time Djumakan started raising children there was not enough land for all of the families in the village.  One day, she and her husband asked Djumakan's parents for one of their three milk cows. That became the beginning of the family's livestock business. \r\n\r\nSince they had a cow, the family began to receive milk.  Djumakan's husband got a job as a shepherd.  The young family with two young children lived in a small room, which had been allocated to them by the collective farm. For five years, they worked hard and saved money to buy a house with a small outhouse. Djumakan and her husband raised two wonderful children, married them off, and become grandparents. \r\n\r\nDjumakan's children left to work in Russia and left her to raise her three grandchildren, aged one and a half, two, and three years old. Today, in order to feed their family, Djumakan keeps two dairy cows and receives about 3,000 som a month from the milk, plus her monthly pension of 2,500 som. This pays for the children's expenses. Also, Djumakan is fattening two steers and plans to purchase additional cattle for fattening and resale, since it is profitable. To do this, she contacted Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan of 130,000 som (KGS) to buy calves. She is planning to invest her profit into more livestock and she dreams of further expanding her farm.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":631.57,"image":{"id":931858,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Panfilovka village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2011-11-30T00:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2800,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Djumakan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":130000,"loan_amount":2800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":9748},{"due_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":9667},{"due_date":"2012-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":9908},{"due_date":"2012-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":10156},{"due_date":"2012-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":10410},{"due_date":"2012-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":10670},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":10937},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":11210},{"due_date":"2012-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":11491},{"due_date":"2012-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":11778},{"due_date":"2012-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":12072},{"due_date":"2012-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":11953}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":209.96},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":208.21},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":213.4},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":218.75},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":224.21},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.82},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":235.56},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":241.45},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":247.5},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":253.68},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":260.01},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":257.45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":209.96,"local_amount":9748,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:30:17Z","rounded_local_amount":9802.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250722527,"comment":null},{"amount":208.21,"local_amount":9667,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:41:31Z","rounded_local_amount":9720.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257125462,"comment":null},{"amount":213.4,"local_amount":9908,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:43:17Z","rounded_local_amount":9962.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263250615,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-12-07T17:57:31Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":364282,"name":"Wendmalgkondo Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Mme JOSEPHINE  est la repr\u00e9sentante du groupe WENDMALGKONDO.

","en":"Abdilat is a 57 year-old farmer, living with his family in the Alike village in the south of Kyrgyzstan.  Abdilat used to work as a driver at an auto park, but his salary did not allow him to cover his family expenses, so he decided to open his own business of animal husbandry and farming.  Thanks to his persistence and hard work, Abdilat's business that started with 20,000 som (KGS), now brings in about 20,000 som (KGS) per month from the sales of dairy and meat products.  Earnings from the business allowed him to make repairs at home and hold weddings for his children.  In order to further increase livestock headcount, Abdilat requested a loan in the sum of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to purchase cattle and sheep.  He plans to invest the profits from this loan into further increasing livestock quantities."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":268.75,"image":{"id":931898,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase cattle and sheep","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Alike village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2011-11-29T21:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abdilat","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"loan_amount":2150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2012-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2012-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2012-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2013-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2013-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2013-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":12500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":268.75},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":268.75},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":268.75},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":268.75},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":268.75},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":268.75},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":268.75},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":268.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":268.75,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:42:41Z","rounded_local_amount":12546.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263250616,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-18T12:03:43Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":364316,"name":"Araksya","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Araksya is from the village of Pokr Mantash in the Shirak region of Armenia.

is Amelita, who is 47 and a resident of Tondo, Manila, Philippines. She is married to Roberto and is a mother to her two children. She, together with her husband and children, manages their household while operating her business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses. \r\n \r\nAmelita operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a small amount of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns a profit by buying supplies at wholesale prices and reselling them by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 400 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help continue operations of her business, she is requesting a loan of PHP 22,000. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nAmelita dreams of being able to give her all her children a good and high quality education through her hard work in her business. She also hopes to have her own grocery store.

She leased a container (retail space) and opens it every day during the second half of the day, thus, combining her business with her primary job.  Marziya's good selection of merchandise, friendly service and practical advice with clothing choice attract more and more customers.

The distribution of farming inputs is part of One Acre Fund\u2019s integrated agriculture package, which includes training, reliable input supply (such as fertilizer and seeds), credit and insurance.\r\n\r\nWith income from her maize sales, Evelyn will educate her children and repay her loans.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, the members of Talente group will each plant between \u00bd and 1 acre of maize.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":932005,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To source farming inputs, such as seeds and fertilizer, at low prices for the 2012 planting season","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2011-11-29T03:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Annet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benjamin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ruth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Evelyn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fridah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esther","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wilfred","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":59500,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":675}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2011-12-19T12:59:00Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":364387,"name":"Habib","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0425\u0430\u0431\u0438\u0431 \u0437\u0430\u0451\u043c\u0449\u0438\u043a \u0432 \u0432\u043e\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0435 71 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430, \u0436\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c \u0414\u0436\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0418\u0441\u043c\u043e\u0438\u043b\u044c, \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043e\u0442\u043a\u043e\u0440\u043c\u043e\u043c \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0442\u0430. \u0423 \u043d\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0441\u0435\u043c\u0435\u0440\u043e \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439, \u0448\u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0441\u044b\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0439 \u0438 \u043e\u0434\u043d\u0430 \u0434\u043e\u0447\u044c. \u0423 \u0425\u0430\u0431\u0438\u0431\u0430 12 \u0432\u043d\u0443\u043a\u043e\u0432, \u0434\u0432\u043e\u0435 \u0438\u0437 \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0445 \u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0433\u0430\u044e\u0442 \u0434\u0435\u0434\u0443. \u041f\u043e\u043c\u0438\u043c\u043e \u0436\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430 \u043e\u043d \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u0435\u043d\u0441\u0438\u044e 100 \u0441\u043e\u043c\u043e\u043d\u0438. \u041e\u0442\u0446\u0443 \u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0433\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0436\u0435 \u0435\u0433\u043e \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0448\u0438\u0439 \u0441\u044b\u043d, \u0441 \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u043c \u0436\u0438\u0432\u0451\u0442 \u0425\u0430\u0431\u0438\u0431 \u0441\u043e \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0435\u0439 \u0436\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0439. \u0417\u0430 \u043f\u044f\u0442\u044c \u043b\u0435\u0442 \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043e\u043d \u043d\u0438 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0443 \u043d\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0440\u0443\u0448\u0438\u043b \u0443\u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0438\u044f \u043e\u0440\u0433\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u0438 \u0431\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0435\u043d \u0438\u043d\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0430\u043c \u0437\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0436\u043a\u0443. \n\u041f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0438\u0432 \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0432 \u0441\u0443\u043c\u043c\u0435 100 \u0441\u043e\u043c\u043e\u043d\u0438, \u043e\u043d \u0445\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0442 \u043a\u0443\u043f\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0431\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0440\u043c \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0442\u0430.\n","en":"Habib is a 71 year-old borrower and a resident of Jamoat Ismoil, who is involved in fattening up livestock.

man, Mukimchon.  He sells fruits at the Panchshanbe market in the city center of Khujand.  Mukimchon buys his product from wholesalers, and his selection includes bananas, apples, tangerines, pears and the like.  His wife works as a teacher at a secondary school, and her salary amounts to only 300 somoni per month, which is not enough for life.  Besides retail sales, Mukimchon is also involved in wholesale resale of large inventories of fruits from dekhan farmers to retail sellers of fruits.

her good turnover.  At the beginning of her credit history, she was involved in small sales and sold men's and women's socks and undergarments, and her goods turnover amounted to only 120 dollars.  Currently, her goods turnover increased and reached 1500 dollars.  She changed her merchandise selection to men's athletic clothing and also changed her place of business.

\n","en":"Cholpon is 39 years old, married and is raising four children, the youngest of whom are school students.  Her husband works in the neighboring Kazakhstan at a construction site.  In search of an additional source of income for her family, Cholpon started her business of selling vegetables and fruits in 2006.  Having started with a sum of 10,000 som (KGS), Cholpon was able to develop her business to have a monthly income of about 20,000 som (KGS), thanks to her persistence and hard work.  She buys fruits and produce, such as apples, tomatoes and peppers from local producers at wholesale prices and then sell the produce at a local market.  In order to further grow her business, Cholpon requested a loan in the sum of 50,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to expand her product selection.  She plans to invest the profits from this loan into an expansion of her retail

Before joining One Acre Fund, Juliana was only able to harvest eight bags of maize on one acre of land.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, One Acre Fund will purchase fertilizer, seeds, and other important inputs to distribute to Juliana and her group during Kenya\u2019s next planting season in February 2012. The distribution of farming inputs is part of One Acre Fund\u2019s integrated agriculture package, which includes training, reliable input supply (such as fertilizer and seeds), credit and insurance.\r\n\r\nWith income from her maize sales, Juliana will educate her children and ensure food security.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, the members of Mulimani group will each plant between \u00bd and 1 acre of maize.\r\n\r\nThe photograph shows Juliana with her group members."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":932049,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To source farming inputs, such as seeds and fertilizer, at low prices for the 2012 planting season.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2011-11-29T03:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Agnes ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatrice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Celestine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jedina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Judith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ruth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":49700,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49700}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":575}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2011-12-20T22:03:02Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":364419,"name":"Edith","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Edith is 21 years old, single, and has one child who attends school.

He joined One Acre Fund in order to grow enough to feed his family and access fertilizer and hybrid seeds. In the recent 2011 season, he had a very good maize yield harvesting 12 1\/2 bags on one acre of land. Before joining One Acre Fund, he was only able to harvest six bags of maize on one acre of land. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, One Acre Fund will purchase fertilizer, seeds, and other important inputs to distribute to Geofrey and his group during Kenya\u2019s next planting season in February 2012. The distribution of farming inputs is part of One Acre Fund\u2019s integrated agriculture package, which includes training, reliable input supply (such as fertilizer and seeds), credit and insurance. \r\n\r\nWith income from his maize sales, Geofrey will invest in livestock rearing and business to raise his living standard. In 2012, the members of Nambami A group will each plant between \u00bd and 1 acre of maize.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":932158,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To

She is separated from her partner but they live in the same rented house along with their two children aged 21 and 15.  Llermeth has a printing business that she started up with her former partner, sharing the business as partners.  Later she began to run it independently after the separation, opening up in a rented space in the center of the city.  She's been running the business for 5 years, and now relies on the help of her oldest child and 2 assistants who she pays by the week. What she appreciates about her business is being able to count on an income, since the allowance that she receives from her ex-partner is not sufficient to pay for the education of their children.  On the other hand, what she doesn't like about her business is that the competition has increased, causing prices to fall and profit margins to fall as well.  But this doesn't discourage her, and she really wants to get back to having her own house.  To do this, she wants to continue to grow and improve her business by purchasing more modern machines that will improve the quality of her printing work.

He is married to Dora.  He lives with his last two children ages 14 and 1 years, installed conveniently in his own house.  The activity that Homberto carries out is agriculture.  For that he relies on his own land of 25 hectares in size where he sows oranges, grapefruits, lemons, tangerines, camu camu and other citrus.  (The camu camu is a fruit about the size of a large grape with purple-red skin and yellow pulp that is very high in vitamin C.)  He has been dedicated to this activity for 40 years.  He also relies on the aid of 5 laborers for the cultivation and harvesting of crops.  What he likes about this activity is to be in contact with nature since he likes life in the field.  Besides the economic income that it generates for him, it permits him to settle the expenses of his home and the education of his children.  In contrast, what he does not like is the problems of the plagues that affect his cultivations and that he must fight.  But that does not discourage him and he has plans to expand his cultivations.  He plans to reforest an extension of his land with timber-yielding trees such as the bolaina.  This will be loan number 5 with the institution MFP.  He is very pleased to know that he will have financial support, since in this way he will feel sure to advance with his activity.  On the other hand he feels good about his communal bank because he considers its members to be good and responsible people.  With the requested total of 1000 new soles, he will invest in hiring personnel for the new crop of oranges that he has on his land.  \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":241.01,"image":{"id":932416,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to hire laborers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-12-03T03:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Humberto ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":155.55},{"due_date":"2011-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":158.65},{"due_date":"2012-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":158.04},{"due_date":"2012-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":170.46},{"due_date":"2012-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":176.82},{"due_date":"2012-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":180.48}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.5},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.26},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.92},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.31},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.68}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":117.83,"local_amount":314.2,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:51:27Z","rounded_local_amount":318.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250836224,"comment":null},{"amount":59.26,"local_amount":158.04,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:17:37Z","rounded_local_amount":160.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245987,"comment":null},{"amount":63.92,"local_amount":170.46,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:31:26Z","rounded_local_amount":173.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263386010,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-12-16T19:45:59Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":364650,"name":"Luisa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nLa socia pertenece al banco comunal \u201dHUCHUY QOSQO\u201d; El banco comunal se encuentra ubicado en el distrito de Lamay en la provincia de Calca y departamento de Cusco.\nLa socia es la Sra.
