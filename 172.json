One of his neighbors has offered him a purebred cow at a very low price, and therefore he has turned to us for a loan in order to make it possible to purchase the cow and branch out into raising that breed.

S. is a 29-year-old married woman with 3 children.

Their daily sales provide just enough income to cover the family's living expenses, but they have had to make difficult decisions along the way.  For instance, they have three children to raise and to feed, and the couple almost did not send their children to school due to their limited income.  However, she and her husband are determined to see to it that their children live a better life and have more opportunities than they had.  <p>\r\n\r\nAs a result, Rosalie and her husband patiently and politely sought assistance in the form of a capital infusion for their fishing business.  They are extremely thankful for Paglaum MPC, which helped to initially finance their business.  They are now seeking a loan in the amount of Php 20,000 to purchase a fishing boat, a fish net, and other fishing accessories.  At this time, they are satisfied to be able to maintain their current business and to have access to Paglaum, which allows poor people like Rosalie to better their lives.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":260842,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","use":"To expand and

In addition, the loan proceeds will be used to sustain and\/or expand her ice-making business.

Her objectives are to be able to grow her inventory and sales in order to have a store in the future.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Cindy Kendall, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":260911,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"Buy school clothing and supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:42Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leydi De Los Angeles","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":5000,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2009-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2009-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2009-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2009-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":625}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":34.38,"local_amount":625,"processed_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:21:56Z","rounded_local_amount":675.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20351602,"comment":null},{"amount":34.38,"local_amount":625,"processed_date":"2009-03-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:07:13Z","rounded_local_amount":675.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27038940,"comment":null},{"amount":34.37,"local_amount":625,"processed_date":"2009-04-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T09:44:06Z","rounded_local_amount":675.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35929234,"comment":null},{"amount":34.38,"local_amount":625,"processed_date":"2009-05-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:22:14Z","rounded_local_amount":675.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44384145,"comment":null},{"amount":34.38,"local_amount":625,"processed_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T16:27:47Z","rounded_local_amount":675.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52890607,"comment":null},{"amount":34.99,"local_amount":636.14,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T09:38:38Z","rounded_local_amount":687.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63111906,"comment":null},{"amount":34.89,"local_amount":634.4,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T09:52:26Z","rounded_local_amount":685.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73533318,"comment":null},{"amount":33.23,"local_amount":604.46,"processed_date":"2009-09-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T09:52:51Z","rounded_local_amount":653.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86964696,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-02-02T21:48:37Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T09:52:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":85695,"name":"Luisa Veronica","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Luisa E. es una joven que a sus 25 a\u00f1os de edad, tiene su propio negocio de tortillas que comenz\u00f3 desde chica ayudando a su mama ya que esa ha sido la fuente de ingresos para sacarlos adelante, es madre soltera con una ni\u00f1a de 7 a\u00f1os de edad, que esta cursando la primaria este negocio lo tiene independiente desde hace seis a\u00f1os, que con ahorro y solicitudes de prestamos que ha hecho en Afodenic ha logrado poder establecerse para vender sus tortillas, es un trabajo cansado y se agita mucho pero se vende bastante ya que a los Nicarag\u00fcenses se caracterizan por que gustan  mucho de su alimento de la tortilla de ma\u00edz, con la solicitud va a comprar materia prima como: ma\u00edz, cal, le\u00f1a, en cantidad, para ofertar a comedores sus ricas tortillas, y poder captar clientes en diferentes comercios.","en":"Luisa E. is a 25 year old young woman who has her own tortilla business that she began in as a young girl, helping her mother.

This will allow her continue to invest in improving her home, which she will be able to leave to her children.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Sally Bolton, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":260930,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction","sector":"Construction","use":"To purchase building materials for a front wall","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:42Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":775,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Esperanza Del Socorro","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":15000,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2009-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2009-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2009-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2009-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2009-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2009-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2010-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2010-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":73.24,"local_amount":1417.47,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:23:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1438.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20351604,"comment":null},{"amount":85.32,"local_amount":1651.44,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:12:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1676.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27038943,"comment":null},{"amount":94.15,"local_amount":1822.29,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T09:47:27Z","rounded_local_amount":1849.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35929237,"comment":null},{"amount":94.83,"local_amount":1835.37,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:24:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1863.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44384148,"comment":null},{"amount":175.42,"local_amount":3395.17,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T09:41:27Z","rounded_local_amount":3446.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63111909,"comment":null},{"amount":51.23,"local_amount":991.55,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T10:47:06Z","rounded_local_amount":1006.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96875163,"comment":null},{"amount":72.78,"local_amount":1408.62,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T10:46:39Z","rounded_local_amount":1429.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103713135,"comment":null},{"amount":128.03,"local_amount":2478.09,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T10:57:11Z","rounded_local_amount":2515.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110600879,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-02-10T16:00:57Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T10:57:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":85698,"name":"Idalia Maria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Do\u00f1a Idalia tiene 37 a\u00f1os de edad, habita en Hialeah II etapa en la ciudad de Managua su negocio es una tienda de ropa y zapatos, tambi\u00e9n vende refrescos desde hace ocho a\u00f1os esta en la venta que inicio con ahorro, tiene un hijo de 16 a\u00f1os de edad, que estudia y por las tarde le ayuda en la venta.

Run T. is a villager in Thmey Tom Lab village, Kampong Speu province, Cambodia. She is a farmer who owns a piece of land to cultivate rice. Her husband, Mr. Sam Yath, sells firewood. Even though they work hard, they do not earn enough income to support their family.

Her husband is an entrepreneur and Khaitgul started her business in 2002 in order to help support her family. All year she sells fruit and vegetables that she buys from local farmers. Twice a week, Khaitgul travels over 60 km to sell her produce at attractive prices at a busy market. With the loan of 3000 Somoni from Kiva, she plans to increase the range of her goods, and to buy apples, pomegranates, oranges, tomatoes, and cucumbers.<P>\r\n\r\nKhaitgul strives to give her children a better life than they have, including seeing them through a high level of education. With her business, she has been able to supply the community with fresh vegetables and also provide for her family. Khaitgul is a well-spoken, friendly businesswoman who is worthy of the support of Kiva lenders.   <P>\r\n \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is married and has three kids. Abdugaffor is a very diligent and hard-working man. With his car he provides taxi services inside the city of Dushanbe. For the last 2 years, the current business had provided their main income, allowing Abdugaffor to improve living conditions for his large family. Besides his wife and children, he is also supporting his parents. <P>\r\n\r\nAs any business generating income, the business of Abdugaffor also requires some investment from time to time. Thus, now his car needs some fixing and also Abdugaffor wants to buy winter tires. For this purpose Abdugaffor is requesting 2500 Somoni for a term of 12 months. Abdugaffor promises to repay the loan promptly and thanks all supporting him. \r\n<P>\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Currently Abdukadir has about US$ 1000 in inventory.

We believe his perseverance and clear vision will become key success factors in his small business. <P>  \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

years ago, Nodira started her clothing business. Experienced and talented in the business, Nodira has expanded her business into a successful trade, supporting her family. Throughout the last four years, IMON International has provided ongoing assistance to Nodira\u2019s business through microfinance loans. Committed to growth and successful entrepreneurship, Nodira has used each loan wisely and has repaid each with a perfect credit history. Currently, she is seeking a loan of 4000 Somoni to purchase more clothing for selling. With the rotation of supplies in her business, she plans to repay the loan within 6 months. The well being of Nodira\u2019s family and her business are in your hands. Nodira and her children are sincerely grateful for your support.    <p>\r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<p>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<p>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<p>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is a widow and has four children. Djonoro is running a catering business where she is providing meals consisting of the national cuisine. She\u2019s renting her catering room which is located in the central local market which allows Djonoro to have many customers, the majority of whom are those making purchases in the market. <P>\r\n\r\nEvery day she purchases the freshest foodstuff and cooks delicious dishes. Her daughters help her with the business. Now she is asking for a loan of 3200 Somoni with a term of 12 months in order to expand her business so as to earn enough to be able to send her children to the university next year. She will use the loan for buying flour, oil and other foodstuffs. She thanks all supporting her and promises to repay the loan promptly. Let\u2019s get behind this dedicated mother to make her dreams become reality!    <P>           \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Her catering room is located near her house and she has many customers, considering that there are many offices located there. Every day she purchases the freshest foodstuffs and cooks delicious dishes.<P>\r\n\r\n Over time she has expanded her business, and now Rohatoy has two assistants who help her with the business. Now she is asking for a loan in the amount of 3200 Somoni with a term of 12 months in order to expand her business further so as to earn enough in order in future to send her children to the university. She will use the loan for purchasing foodstuffs for her canteen. She thanks all supporting her and promises to repay the loan promptly. <P>\r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She has an attractively arranged store at Dushanbe market where she carries all sorts of necessary items for new mothers, including children's toys. Gulbahor has been in this business for about 8 years and has developed a stable, profitable enterprise based on products that are always in demand. Her business has become the main source of income for her and her family. Gulbahor\u2019s business is growing.

With your help this will be possible.   <P>\r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.

Sherali is 37 years old. He is married with five children. He is a small entrepreneur who sells different kinds of foodstuffs such as: sweets, meat products, preserved foods, soft drinks, juices and other items in his grocery store. Sherali is not alone in this business. His whole family actively helps him with sales. <P>\r\n\r\nSherali admits he has benefited a lot in the past 3 years from his relationship with IMON International. Financial assistance he has received has helped him grow and expand his business. Currently Sherali is requesting a loan of 3253 Somoni for a term of 9 months to increase his stock. He is ready to work even harder, make sacrifices and push every once and a while to achieve his goal and become a successful entrepreneur. We believe his perseverance and clear vision will become key success factors in his small business.  \r\n<P>\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Y.  is 46 years old. She is married with three children of school age. Sharofat is running a caf\u00e9 where she is providing meals of the national and European cuisine. The caf\u00e9 is located in the central local market which allows Sharofat to have many customers, the majority of whom are those making purchases in the market. The business has been generating a stable income during the last 12 years. Now Sharofat is planning to purchase foodstuffs like wheat, potatoes, carrots, onions, and oil  wholesale. With this purpose in mind, she is requesting 800 US Dollars for a term of 11 months. Sharofat has already been provided with two loans by IMON International and has proved herself a reliable client. Today she thanks all supporting her and promises to repay the loan promptly.    \r\n<P>\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions. But, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is very content with the career he studied, and now enjoys the fruits of his labors.  He charges 60.00 to 80.00 Peruvian soles per repair, particularly during the coffee harvest season when motorcycles are used frequently to transport the product and therefore require more of his services.

They are currently living in her mother-in-law\u2019s house. Since she began living at her mother-in-law\u2019s home she dedicates herself to taking her cows to pasture, but there are also days that she works on the small farm with her husband, on those days she wakes up early to cook lunch and takes it into the fields. On her way she also takes the animals and ties them to places where there is a lot of pasture for them to eat. Miriam and her husband have taken this opportunity to plant peas on rented small plots of land that charge them for each cultivated crop. The good thing is that they are plots of land with good road access, and when she walks from her home to the fields she can do it in only half an hour. She is happy with her work, be it working on the small farm or putting the animals to pasture, the only difficulty is that it when it rains a great deal because she carries her baby on her back she has to cover him very well, given that once he got wet and caught a cold. As such when it rains hard she gets a hold of him and returns home.

Desde muy joven se ha dedicado a la agricultura, sembrando arvejas y papas, pero lo que m\u00e1s le agrada es cultivar flores de gladiolo, aunque tienen un largo proceso; una vez listas las pepitas de semilla se procede a abrir los surcos, en seguida se colocan las semillas y se entierra, se espera a que germine, una ves que haya brotado la planta se procede con el fumigado hasta que maduren las flores. Lo m\u00e1s gratificante para ella es el precio en que los llega a vender en el mes de mayo y octubre por las festividades del d\u00eda de la madre y de los muertos respectivamente, llegan a pagarle por el paqueta hasta 80 soles, pasada esta temporada baja hasta mitad el precio, pero igual no pierde, ya que lo que aun esta en la tierra, lo deja madurar para realizar el proceso de la semilla. En semilla cuesta mucho m\u00e1s, la vende a 150 soles el saco, por todo este beneficio es lo que le agrada sembrar gladiolos.

At the moment she is living with her mother-in-law. \r\n\r\nEver since she was very young, she has been committed to agriculture, growing peas and potatoes. But what gives her the most pleasure is growing gladiolas, although the process for doing so is much more involved. When the seeds are ready to be planted, the rows must be tilled, then the seeds must be planted and buried. Then you must wait until they germintate, then once the plants get buds, you fumigate them until the flowers are mature. The most gratifying part for her is the price she is able to sell them for in the months of May and October, when the holidays of Mother's Day and the Day of the Dead occur, respectively, when a bouquet can be sold for 80 soles. When these seasons have passed, the price goes down to half of that, but the loss does not matter as long as she can be in the land--she could take or leave the mature flowers for the process of just growing the seeds. \r\n\r\nThe seeds cost a lot and are sold for about 150 soles for a sack, but the benefit is being able to grwo gladiolas. Haydee is new to the lender, MFP, and she and others have formed a new comunnal bank with the commitment of paying all of the payments back by the time indicated and according to the instructions of the loan consultant.

In the morning, Rosa goes to her mother\u2019s house to prepare lunch for all the farm workers, and around 11:00 am, she takes her donkey and arrives at the farm at 12:00. She then proceeds to serve lunch to all the workers there. At that time, her family is growing potatoes on the farm while Rosa is preparing the pesticides that she carried along with the lunches. Working this way is more relaxing and entertaining because the work is done in harmony. They take their crops to market together, and each person accounts for the amount of sacks they transport. Rosa and her family are satisfied with and grateful to agriculture and to God for keeping the family united. They are also grateful for the crops that they harvest every time they plant them.

During this whole time, she has been learning the responsibilities of a good farmer. Her specialty is growing potatoes, for which she gets up at 4:00 am to prepare meals. At around 8:00am, she takes the food and walks for an hour and a half to get to her farms. Meanwhile, her husband starts working the fields at 6:00am in order to get a head start. The problem, which is out of their control, that threatens them is when frost affects the potatoes, they lose their investment. Because of this aspect, they grow crops in irrigated lands, but they do not have their own land, which means they must rent land that is available. Hence, they do not lose much and at the same time, they do not invest much. They plant the other half on their seasonal farm, but the investment is more costly and they run the risk of frost.

The structure is called a \u201cramada\u201d and is used for shade for open air stands because of all the heat in the region. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Elizabeth Casian, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":261616,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"Build a roof for her business space","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-01-27T04:50:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":900,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":137.81},{"due_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":141.92},{"due_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":145.71},{"due_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":153.03},{"due_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":158.08},{"due_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":163.45}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.94},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":47.31},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.57},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.01},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.69},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.48}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":45.94,"local_amount":137.81,"processed_date":"2009-02-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:02:50Z","rounded_local_amount":146.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20423693,"comment":null},{"amount":47.31,"local_amount":141.92,"processed_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:33:24Z","rounded_local_amount":150.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116962,"comment":null},{"amount":48.57,"local_amount":145.71,"processed_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:42:49Z","rounded_local_amount":154.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011883,"comment":null},{"amount":51.01,"local_amount":153.03,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:58:50Z","rounded_local_amount":162.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595483,"comment":null},{"amount":52.69,"local_amount":158.08,"processed_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:38:07Z","rounded_local_amount":167.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989722,"comment":null},{"amount":54.48,"local_amount":163.45,"processed_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:39:54Z","rounded_local_amount":173.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210861,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-01-27T04:59:55Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T16:39:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":85849,"name":"Emma","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Emma tiene 37 a\u00f1os, es madre de 4 hijos en edad escolara, vive con su esposo, quien la ayuda en lo posible.

Her house is her own.  She works as a seamstress.  Her specialties are bags and alter cloths.  She and her daughters have worked for the past 5 years showing her products in outside her house.  Victoria sells during the entire day.  What she likes about the work is that each day she learns more about the novelties and designs for what she makes.  The hard part is she doesn\u2019t have a suitable place for it, such that the articles are exposed for any robber and she is not able to provide comfort for her clients.  But, on the other hand, it makes a good income because she has found she is located in a good area with many passers by and she sells all day.  This is her first loan with MFP, and with the money that she is asking for she would make her dream a reality, which is to order the construction of a kiosk for her business.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jessica Kaminsky, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":261625,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction","sector":"Construction","use":"To construct a stall for her textile business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-01-27T00:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Victoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":600,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":91.83},{"due_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":94.56},{"due_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":97.1},{"due_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":101.97},{"due_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":105.32},{"due_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":109.22}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":30.61},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":31.52},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.37},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.99},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.11},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.4}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":30.61,"local_amount":91.83,"processed_date":"2009-02-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:02:39Z","rounded_local_amount":97.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20423698,"comment":null},{"amount":31.52,"local_amount":94.56,"processed_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:33:14Z","rounded_local_amount":100.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116967,"comment":null},{"amount":32.36,"local_amount":97.1,"processed_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:42:35Z","rounded_local_amount":103.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011888,"comment":null},{"amount":33.99,"local_amount":101.97,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:58:32Z","rounded_local_amount":108.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595488,"comment":null},{"amount":35.11,"local_amount":105.32,"processed_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:38:05Z","rounded_local_amount":111.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989727,"comment":null},{"amount":36.41,"local_amount":109.22,"processed_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:39:52Z","rounded_local_amount":115.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210866,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-01-27T02:23:45Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T16:39:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":85856,"name":"Elizabeth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elizabeth O. is 27 years old and married with 2 children.

Our group is called Brillante Amenecer and the following people are members:\r\nSra. Sayra R. has for 20 years earned her living by selling cosmetics and plastic products and also for four years making baked goods. She lives in Union Libre with her husband who raises cattle. She has four dependent children. Her husband is responsible for the family expenses, and she contributes what small amount she can.\r\nSr. Andres H. has been a businessman for 20 years. His main business is a small convenience store, a common line of work in our society. He is single but is responsible for the education and daily expenses of his two siblings, plus the cost of food for his mother since his father has passed away. His mother was left without support, so Andres had to take over all the family\u2019s food expenses.\r\nSra. Gloria de Jesus C\u00e1liz is a businesswoman and has been operating a small convenience store for five years now. She lives in Union Libre and has three children who are still dependent on her. Her husband is a farmer and pays for household expenses. With the money that she earns from her store, Gloria covers her own personal expenses and as well helps her husband with household expenses. She also works hard to buy kitchen utensils and household electrical appliances, important things for the home--she has bought these out of the profits from the business.\r\nSra. Yeni P. worked selling cosmetics for many years, but as she is a single mother with a son who is completely dependent on her, the business did not supply enough income to provide for her family. She managed to obtain a small convenience store which greatly helps her to cover household expenses, so she now has two businesses. When she is out selling cosmetics, her son helps her with the store.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jane Agg, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1575,"image":{"id":261729,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"purchase merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Danli","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.033333 -86.583333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":118,"posted_date":"2009-01-28T00:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sayra Esmelin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Andres ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gloria De Jesus","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yeni Xiomara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":29000,"loan_amount":1575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":3625},{"due_date":"2009-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3625},{"due_date":"2009-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3625},{"due_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3625},{"due_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3625},{"due_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3625},{"due_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3625},{"due_date":"2009-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3625}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":196.88},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":196.88},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":196.88},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":196.88},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":196.88},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":196.88},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":196.88},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":196.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":196.9,"local_amount":3625.5,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:51:41Z","rounded_local_amount":3683.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20433630,"comment":null},{"amount":196.88,"local_amount":3625,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:40:03Z","rounded_local_amount":3683.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27127964,"comment":null},{"amount":196.87,"local_amount":3625,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:06:32Z","rounded_local_amount":3683.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36024760,"comment":null},{"amount":95.04,"local_amount":1750,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:57:29Z","rounded_local_amount":1778.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44610664,"comment":null},{"amount":156.14,"local_amount":2875,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T23:44:32Z","rounded_local_amount":2921.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53007460,"comment":null},{"amount":196.87,"local_amount":3625,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:03:55Z","rounded_local_amount":3683.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63229713,"comment":null},{"amount":142.58,"local_amount":2625,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:12:58Z","rounded_local_amount":2667.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73661306,"comment":null},{"amount":393.72,"local_amount":7249.5,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T01:46:57Z","rounded_local_amount":7365.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87101336,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

Jos\u00e9 has two children: his older son is 16 and in his third year of high school and his younger son is 11 and in Grade 5.  His partner does not live with him for now because she works far from their country trying to make a better life for her children and her family.  Jos\u00e9's goal is to improve his business and create stability for his sons in their studies: because of the situation in the country, some families are removing their children from school due to a lack of money.  His dream is to start another business which will help him, so that his sons can learn to manage the business and that in the future they will brave the hard times in life.  He dreams that his wife will return to Nicaragua, that she can finally find work here and care for their children, be with her family and achieve the quality of life which they want so very much.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 has been selling groceries from his home for the past 16 years.  He started the business for his family; the grocery store was initially his wife's responsibility.  She started it with her own money and decided to buy products such as eggs, sweets, rice, oil and juices.  Her husband always supported her in managing the grocery store but she needed to make more income for her family and therefore decided to travel and look for work outside the country.  Thus, her husband took over the grocery store and has been trying to support his family with the business.  Initially it was difficult becaues he did not know much about managing the business - he had to learn to buy the goods - as well as care for his sons and do the household chores.  With time, he learned to do all these things.  He is now asking for a loan to use as working capital as he needs to buy staple goods, sweets, cosmetics and clothes.  He also wants to invest in school supplies as school will be starting soon and he would like to offer his clients a choice of products.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Laure Kwon, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":261737,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-01-29T02:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jose Antonio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":18000,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1636.36},{"due_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1636.36},{"due_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1636.36},{"due_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1636.36},{"due_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1636.36},{"due_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1636.36},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1636.36},{"due_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1636.36},{"due_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1636.36},{"due_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1636.36},{"due_date":"2009-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1636.4}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":81.82},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":81.82},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.82},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.82},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.82},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.82},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.82},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.82},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.82},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.82},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.8}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":81.82,"local_amount":1636.36,"processed_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:41:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1647.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20400012,"comment":null},{"amount":81.82,"local_amount":1636.36,"processed_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:36:52Z","rounded_local_amount":1647.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27092010,"comment":null},{"amount":81.81,"local_amount":1636.36,"processed_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:39:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1647.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35985393,"comment":null},{"amount":81.82,"local_amount":1636.36,"processed_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:10:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1647.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44446008,"comment":null},{"amount":81.82,"local_amount":1636.36,"processed_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:40:25Z","rounded_local_amount":1647.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52956649,"comment":null},{"amount":490.91,"local_amount":9818.2,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T14:00:13Z","rounded_local_amount":9886.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63174074,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

Except for one woman who sells CDs, the members work in the sale of cosmetics and beauty products and women's accessories, like cosmetics, clothing, shoes and Herbalife products. There exists great competition in the market, and thus, the members are forced to improve their product's quality and provide better service.

Her partner is a foreman on the farm Santa Cecilia.  Narcisa aims to maintain her good credit record \u2013it will be a huge help to her in the future.  Narcisa dreams of opening another business \u2013 it could increase her income so that she could better support her children.  She wants to give them all they need to live day-to-day without difficulty.   She wishes also to make improvements to their property, since it is all her family has. and she wants her children to have their own house with good quality necessities; she wants it to be a decent place to live.  She wants to achieve all this with much effort and constant work.\r\nNarcisa raises pigs and sells the pork on foot.  Her operation is at her house.  She has had this business for twelve years.  She got involved in the business because this type of business was already in her family.  She has stuck with it because it is not too difficult, but she had trouble attracting customers because she has a lot of competition, and all the people in this type of business already had their own customers.  This is why, in the beginning, she decided to go out into the streets to try to sell her meat and nacatamales (a special Latin American tamale).  The different customers she gained were from other places.  They began coming to her house to buy nacatamales, fried foods, and charrascas.  These customers made her business known, and her neighbors came by her house and bought more that they liked.  Now she is requesting a loan to increase her working capital, since she has to look for pigs and travel here and there to get them at the best price and make the most of her business.\r\n\r\n<br

Guti\u00e9rrez is 37 years old, partnered, and has two sons. Her older son is 19 years old and in his fifth year of secondary school. Her younger son is 12 and in his third year of secondary school. Her partner works as a security guard. \r\n<p>\r\nKarla's goal is to find another source of income, since expenses rise every day, while salaries remain the same. Karla is concerned about her family's financial security and wants to do whatever she can to be a responsible mother. She wants to be able to continue earning enough money to provide for her sons' needs. She hopes they will appreciate the sacrifices she has made for them and that they will become good people who work in professional occupations. Karla's dream is to make improvements to her home so that she can leave her sons a comfortable place to live, which will enable them to gradually develop maturity.\r\n<p>\r\nFor the last two years, Karla has sold telephone cards and prepaid cellular phone airtime from her home. She started her business when her partner lost his job and they did not have any income. She began by selling Movistar brand phone cards.

They had the opportunity to finish primary school, which has allowed them to be communicative and accessible people in society.  They started their businesses as walking saleswomen, selling their clothes as they walked the streets.  Mrs. Araceli del Carmen L., along with her group, has received two previous credits from Kiva field partner ADIM.  Araceli has only a few months of work experience, but it has been very good because it has given her confidence and she feels that she should respond equally.  That\u2019s how she expresses it to her group and encourages them to continue with their excellent work.  She is hoping to attend a training to which she has been invited, and she wants to move forward.  She sells new and used clothes.  She displays the used clothing in her home, but she carries new clothing solely based on client orders.  Her orders are continually growing.  She has two small children that she takes care of herself.  She is very proud to be able to have a business and be recognized for it, and her children\u2019s quality of life has improved notably because of it.  The requested loan will be used to purchase selected clothing in bulk so that she can offer better products for her clients.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Debra Faszer-McMahon, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":261834,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To purchase varied clothing to sell to clients","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Masaya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.966667 -86.1","type":"point"}},"partner_id":120,"posted_date":"2009-01-29T02:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Araceli Del Carmen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Meyling Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ma.

C. is 58 years old, partnered, and has three sons (ages 38, 36, and 32) who are all married and self-employed. His partner runs a small restaurant in their home. German's goal is to provide proper maintenance for his truck to give his customers high-quality service. He would also like to upgrade to a larger and more modern vehicle so that his customers are more comfortable. His dream is to have a pool hall, which would generate greater income for his family. As a pool hall is in great demand from young people, he would have a large clientele and he would be able to pass on the business to his sons so they would have adequate support.\r\n<p>\r\nFor forty years, German has offered transportation between the city and rural areas. He began his business in Managua, using his own money. Previously he had sold products such as picture frames, vases, and appliances. That business was difficult to maintain because he often was unable to sell all his merchandise.

S. Asomidin has been selling vegetables in Dushanbe Central market for the past 2 years. He began his own stall with his hard-earned savings as he had always wanted to be an entrepreneur. Asomidin began selling vegetables at the market with very little stock to offer his clients. Slowly he began to increase the goods offered until he managed to get a permanent market stall. Currently his stall is his pride and joy with a zinc roof and ceramic tiles on the floor. Asomidin is a father of two children who are in school. Like any father, he is doing his best in order to ensure his children the best future and to make them well educated. Now he needs a loan for a size of 4000 Somoni in order to increase the stock of his selling goods. He promises to repay the loan within 9 months and expresses his gratitude to everyone supporting him.  <p>\r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<p>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<p>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Mavdjigul tries to offer good prices to her customers while still making a profit. A normal monthly income from her business is around 1000 Somoni. Mavdjigul has requested a loan of 3000 Somoni with the term of 6 months to increase her product inventory. By purchasing additional inventory, Mavdjigul will be better prepared to meet increased demand and earn a good income.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<p>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

is married with two children. This is an average family from Dushanbe, Tajikistan. However, Mahfuza is a unique entrepreneur. She has been selling kids' clothing in the central city market for about 2 years, running her own small venture successfully. The secret of her success is simple: she tries to not only let her customers know the benefits of her products \u2013 she also gives them a sense of relationship which brings them back again and again. However, she doesn\u2019t want to stop where she is at with her venture. <P>\r\n\r\nMahfuza is seeking a loan of 3400 Somoni to re-stock the merchandise in her store for the winter season.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

H.  is a small entrepreneur from Khujand, Tajikistan. She is married and the loving mother of three children, who are the reason for her daily fight for a better life. Shahodat sells women's traditional dresses and skull-caps in one of the famous local markets called \u201cPanjshanbe\u201d. <P>\r\n\r\nShahodat is a very hard-working woman. She always achieves all her goals and overcomes different challenges with natural optimism. She is requesting a loan of 1000 USD for the term of 12 months to re-stock her inventory. She is hoping to purchase more merchandise at affordable wholesale prices for further retail sale. The only dream of Shahodat is to ensure her children of a good education and to make them happy. We believe Shahodat\u2019s integrity and the consistent growth of her venture in the past years can guarantee further stable expansion of her venture and timely loan repayment. <P>\r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

B. is a loving and self-sacrificing father. Ever since he was very young, Ashur has been around people raising animals, and thanks to this knowledge, he dedicates himself to raising and selling cattle, work that he learned from his humble parents. With experience gained over time in the purchase and sale of cattle, he has been able to bring stability to his family. <P>\r\n\r\nThe desire that Ashur harbors in his heart is that of increasing his capital to invest in acquiring more animals. In this way, he can create more income for his family. Above all, he hopes to offer a better quality of life for his beloved children, who always support him unconditionally in his daily work. He requests 1000 USD for the term of 10 months. Let\u2019s get together behind the request of this devoted father to help him keep bringing well-being and security to the members of his family.   <P>\r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

In time, she gained customers and a good reputation for her work. Initially she had only one sewing machine. She has expanded her business and now has three sewing machines and three workers. On average she sews 3 to 4 dresses per day. She is asking for a loan of 3400 Somoni (1000 USD) that will be invested in buying a computer-based sewing machine to make the quality of her dresses at a high level.

It was a key post along the Silk Road and is where the rule of Alexander the Great ended.  It is famous for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\n<p>But, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Very early on, she abandoned school to devote herself to income-generating work, notably buying and selling beauty products and various other goods.  She learned commerce from her mom when she was young.  And now,  making it on her own for two years, she is very well known in the cosmetics sector. \r\n\r\nTo expand her work and diversify her business, she decided to join the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso two months ago.  She is on her first individual loan and plans to buy a sizable stock of beauty products with it.  She gets her supplies from wholesale merchants of Koutiala and often in Bamako (capital of Mali).  From her display at the Koko marketplace in the city of Koutiala, she makes her sales to customers composed essentially of women, cash or credit accepted.\r\n\r\nMaimouna intends to realize a monthly profit of 30,000 francs CFA that she envisions using to repay the loan interest and to prepare for her marriage.

He lives with his four children and wife in his home in the Hamdallaye district in Koutiala prefecture (third administrative region of the Republic of Mali).  After having tried several kinds of income-generating work, he decided to specialize in the commerce of clothing ten years ago.  He is in high demand when it is market day each week in Koutiala City and surrounding villages.\r\n<p>\r\nTo diversify his business, he decided to turn towards the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso two months ago.  He is on his first individual loan.  With this loan, he plans to buy different styles and brand of ready-to-wear clothing.  He gets his supplies in Lom\u00e9 (capital of the Republic of Togo) and sells them, cash or credit accepted, in his shop, located at the grand marketplace of Koutiala, and in the weekly markets.  His customers are composed of women and men. \r\n<p>\r\nHe intends to realize a monthly profit of 140,000 francs CFA that he envisions using for repaying the loan interest and to providing for his

They live in traditional extended families in the village of Koumantou (in Bougouni prefecture, third administrative region of the Republic of Mali).  This group essentially does a variety and diversity of work:  catering, clothing, ... \r\n<p>\r\nThe group members have been partners of Soro Yiriwaso for three years and are on their sixth loan.  According to the president, this partnership is very important because it enables them to have continuous capital for working in income-generating businesses.  The current loan is enough to buy 10 kg of fresh fish each day at 650 francs CFA per kilo, 5 liters of cooking oil, and some firewood.  The fish will be fried and offered for sale.  This commerce allows them to earn 200 francs per kilo of fish sold.  The group members make their sales from a fixed location at the marketplace and door-to-door in the different districts of Koumantou, cash or credit accepted, to customers composed generally of women. \r\n<p>\r\nThe members who sell cloth will buy 10 lengths of Wax brand cloth in Bamako (capital of Mali).  This cloth is cut up into three \"pagnes\" (each typically about 1 meter by 3 meters in size) which are then sold.  Damask fabric is sold by the meter.  The merchants earn 250 francs from each pagne sold and 500 francs from each meter of damask sold. \r\n<p>\r\nThe group members can realize an average of 30,000 to 45,000 francs per month.  This is enough to repay the loan and to address certain family expenses.  In the future, the group members want to have their own shops in order to become wholesalers of the fresh fish and cloth that customers demand.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":262157,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy fish and cloth ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Bougouni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.416667 -7.483333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:28Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bana   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mama ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djoba ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Naminata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":170.83},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":170.83},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.83},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.83},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.83},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":170.83,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:12:20Z","rounded_local_amount":84948.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20440354,"comment":null},{"amount":170.83,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:07:56Z","rounded_local_amount":84948.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135732,"comment":null},{"amount":170.83,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:28:22Z","rounded_local_amount":84948.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033533,"comment":null},{"amount":170.83,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:38:54Z","rounded_local_amount":84948.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44620901,"comment":null},{"amount":170.83,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:21:29Z","rounded_local_amount":84948.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53019866,"comment":null},{"amount":170.85,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2009-07-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:18:57Z","rounded_local_amount":84948.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242624,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-02-03T10:43:17Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T19:18:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":85997,"name":"Naut","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Naut S., 33, is married and lives with her husband in the Kampong Cham province, Cambodia.

The women of Yankadi are involved in a variety of income-generating activities ranging from small restaurants to selling seasonings, not to mention occasionally selling fruit and vegetables. The women have been Soro Yiriwaso partners for the last two years and they are on their fourth loan. All of the previous loans were successfully repaid. With this new loan they would like to buy seasonings from Sikasso on market day. They make a 50 Franc CFA profit on every kilogram of onions sold; each kilogram of fish sold brings in 250 Francs CFA. The cake saleswomen buy a 25 kilogram bag of wheat flour, as well as shea butter and yeast to make their baked goods. They use five kilograms of flour each Wednesday, market day, for sales. The members of Yankadi make an average profit of 30,000 Francs CFA per month. This allows them to reimburse their loan and meet certain household needs (health, education, clothing, etc). In the future each of these women would like to become a wholesaler of seasonings, wheat flour, and other items popular with the local population.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Liana Bianchi, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":262184,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase seasonings and ingredients for baked goods","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Bougouni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.416667 -7.483333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:28Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":825,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Chata      ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamou  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bintou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":400000,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:12:13Z","rounded_local_amount":68373.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20440355,"comment":null},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:08:00Z","rounded_local_amount":68373.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135733,"comment":null},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:28:07Z","rounded_local_amount":68373.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033534,"comment":null},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:38:58Z","rounded_local_amount":68373.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44620902,"comment":null},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:21:18Z","rounded_local_amount":68373.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53019867,"comment":null},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":66666.65,"processed_date":"2009-07-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:19:00Z","rounded_local_amount":68373.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242625,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-02-02T23:45:56Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T19:19:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":86016,"name":"Yinka","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Yinka O. sells sarongs.

Farida is 29 years old, married and has one child. Farida has been selling clothing for children for the past 3 years. She started this business because her husband has no fixed job and sometimes they had difficulties in their lives. Using her savings, she started to travel to the neighboring town of Istaravshan to buy clothing to sell at the local market of Isfara. Little by little she increased the number of clients and expanded her business. Nevertheless, presently her selection of garments is poor and therefore she requests a loan of 2500 Somoni to be repaid in 6 months. With this loan Farida can purchase new and varied merchandise to offer her clients. \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history. It was a key post along the Silk Road and is where the rule of Alexander the Great ended.  It is famous for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language,  and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\n<p>But, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

From an early age, she started working to earn an income with a neighbor who used to sell clothing.  After several years of apprenticeship with her, Aminata has been working on her own for four years selling clothing, blankets, and bed sheets at the Ch\u00e2teau marketplace.  She enjoys a large customer base and distinction.  Her strong sales are due to her affordable prices and the quality of her clothing. \r\n<p>\r\nConcerned about ensuring continued work and to increase her sales figures, she has turned towards the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso, which has had an association with her for three years.  After four solidarity loans and one individual loan, all repaid, she is on her second individual loan, which will be used to buy 5 lengths of Wax pagnes (colorful West African cloth of good quality), 5 sets of blankets and sheets, and 5 children's outfits.  She gets her supplies from wholesalers in Bamako (capital of Mali) and sell to customers composed of men and women, cash or credit accepted. \r\n<p>\r\nShe intends to realize a monthly profit of 70,000 francs CFA that will enable her to replenish her stock of merchandise and to help her husband  support the family.  Her ambition is to have a house. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":262234,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To buy clothing, blankets, and bed sheets ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Segou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14 -6","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:28Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":775,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariam ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":375000,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.64}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":86.11},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":86.11},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.11},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.11},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.11},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.11},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.11},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.11},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":86.11,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2009-02-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:13:08Z","rounded_local_amount":42819.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20440360,"comment":null},{"amount":86.11,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:09:51Z","rounded_local_amount":42819.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135739,"comment":null},{"amount":86.11,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:31:51Z","rounded_local_amount":42819.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033540,"comment":null},{"amount":86.11,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:41:00Z","rounded_local_amount":42819.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44620908,"comment":null},{"amount":86.11,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2009-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:22:58Z","rounded_local_amount":42819.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53019873,"comment":null},{"amount":86.11,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2009-07-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:20:30Z","rounded_local_amount":42819.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242631,"comment":null},{"amount":86.11,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:43:49Z","rounded_local_amount":42819.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678151,"comment":null},{"amount":86.11,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2009-09-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T03:56:57Z","rounded_local_amount":42819.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87112409,"comment":null},{"amount":86.12,"local_amount":41666.64,"processed_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T07:09:52Z","rounded_local_amount":42819.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97028065,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-02-02T00:03:33Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T07:09:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":86042,"name":"Katende Nulu\u2018S Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p>Nulu is the leader of a four member group.

It was a key post along the Silk Road and is where the rule of Alexander the Great ended. It is famous for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\n<p>But, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

Ahmatillo has been in touch with the countryside. His family dedicated themselves to cultivating fruits and vegetables and he imagined he\u2019d be in the business of selling produce. Fortunately, he has realized this dream. At the age of 22, he began to sell fruit and vegetables in small markets. Little by little, he saved money so he could set up his own shop. Thanks to his efforts and the love he has for this business, Ahmatillo\u2019s enterprise has been growing gradually. Nevertheless, Ahmatillo believes it is time to inject more capital into the business so that he can buy at the wholesale level and obtain better prices. As a result, he is applying for a loan of 3500 Somoni, which he will repay in 9 months. With your help, Ahmatillo will be able to move his business forward and offer his wife and two children a better future.  \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history. It was a key post along the Silk Road and is where the rule of Alexander the Great ended. It is famous for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\n<p>But, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

The country is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\n<p>But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Ayubboy is 47 years old, married and has five children. He sells cattle.  He purchases young cattle at the central market, feeds them and then resells them at higher prices at the local market. He has been in the business for fourteen years and knows very well how to choose the animals, how to breed them and how to look after them.  He rises early each day to feed and look after his animals. His knowledge and skills allow him to make his business a success and it generates a considerably good and stable income for his large, supportive family. Because he knows that today the prices for the animals are favorable, but will certainly increase, Ayubboy is planning to enlarge his herd and purchase more cattle. For this purpose, he has requested a loan of $875 US for a term of six months. You could become an important part in Ayubboy's family's life. He deeply appreciates the trust and support you are giving him.\r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history.  It was a key post along the Silk Road and where the rule of Alexander the Great ended. It is famous for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others.The country is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\n<p>But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Ugiloy is 39 years old, married and the loving mother of four children. She is a vendor and for the last thirteen years has been selling cottonseed oil at the local market.

Our national dish \u201cOshi palov\u201d especially uses a great deal of cottonseed oil to make it delicious. So the goods that Uguloy sells are in great demand by the population.

It was a key post along the Silk Road and is where the rule of Alexander the Great ended. It is famous for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\n<p>But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It was a key post along the Silk Road and is where the rule of Alexander the Great ended.  It is famous for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

Her husband died painfully through a prolonged sickness. She was almost in tears when we were talking because she believes he has left so much responsibility on her.\r\n\r\nShe is a food vendor who sells kenkey in her neighborhood. Kenkey is prepared from milled maize grains, cooked and taken with hot pepper and fried fish.

Boapong is 38 years old and a divorced mother with four children. Three of her children are currently in school. Juliana divorced her husband because she felt he was unfaithful to her.\r\n\r\nJuliana sells meat in the local market of Abuakwa to support her family. She buys her type of meat in a large quantity and then roasts it on the fire before selling it in the market. Juliana says roasting gives the meat a very good taste and also preserves it from getting spoiled. She says the demand for her meat is high but she does not have enough capital  to meet these demands. \r\n\r\nShe wants to use the loan to buy more meat to enable her to raised enough income to support her children education.

Cecilia decided to start in the trader business in order to take care of herself, as that was the only option open to her at that time. She has been trading in the sale of used cloths for the past 8 years now. \r\n\r\nSelling of used clothing is an important market in Ghana, as brand new cloths are very expensive for the poor. Therefore, selling of used clothing has become a big market for many women like Cecilia. With the loan, she wants to buy more bales of used clothing to increase her inventory. She plans to use this loan to rent a store to trade and with the increased profits, save for her children\u2019s future education. \r\n\r\nCecilia belongs to a village bank called \u2018Regina\u2019.

","en":"Rene Hilario Mondragon Ramirez is 49 years old, married, has one son who is seven years old, and attended school through the fifth grade.  His life partner works as a pharmacy sales clerk. His plans are to continue working to support his family and pay the loan from Foundation Leon 2000. He hopes to get another transport vehicle because the one he now has is not in very good condition, but because of the difficult economic condition the country finds itself in it is very difficult to replace the vehicle, since with what he earns he needs to maintain his home. His dreams are that his son is able to prepare himself sufficiently so that he can have a good future. Also, he wants his son to study since he did not have the opportunity to study and he does not want his son to face this type of situation, which is why he works so hard, so that his son has the possibility to be prepared for studying. \r\n\r\nHis work is to provide taxi service, moving around. He has had this business for two years. Don Rene started this business as a truck driver and saved what he was paid since he was planning to buy a car and use it to provide taxi service. This would be the type of work that he would use to maintain his family but due to the situation he could not get all the money together, but later his sister took it upon herself to help him so that Don Rene was able to buy his vehicle and that's how he got his taxi. His experiences with his clients, providing this service, have pleased him a lot, since he likes to serve the public. And his family has helped him as necessary since it is dignified and humble work, plus it is through this means that he assures that his family obtains what is necessary. The financing is for working capital to improve his vehicle and will be used to buy rear shock absorbers, rear springs, front headlights, and a set of ball bearings. All these things can be obtained at a good price in Managua. He is grateful for the credit opportunity offered by the Foundation Leon 2000 and the different organizations.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Daniel Burke, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":262367,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","use":"Working capital to improve his taxi","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-02-02T18:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rene Hilario","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":5000,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":454.55},{"due_date":"2009-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":454.55},{"due_date":"2009-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":454.55},{"due_date":"2009-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":454.55},{"due_date":"2009-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":454.55},{"due_date":"2009-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":454.55},{"due_date":"2009-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":454.55},{"due_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":454.55},{"due_date":"2009-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":454.55},{"due_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":454.55},{"due_date":"2009-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":454.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25,"local_amount":454.55,"processed_date":"2009-02-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:40:19Z","rounded_local_amount":489.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20400019,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":454.55,"processed_date":"2009-03-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:35:08Z","rounded_local_amount":489.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27092017,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":454.55,"processed_date":"2009-04-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:37:25Z","rounded_local_amount":489.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35985400,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":454.55,"processed_date":"2009-05-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:08:54Z","rounded_local_amount":489.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44446015,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":454.55,"processed_date":"2009-06-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:39:04Z","rounded_local_amount":489.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52956655,"comment":null},{"amount":150,"local_amount":2727.25,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T13:59:58Z","rounded_local_amount":2935.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63174079,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-02-04T02:18:08Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T13:59:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":86120,"name":"Taiwo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Taiwo A. is a hairdresser.
