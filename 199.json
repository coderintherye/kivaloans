Many of them started their businesses with the first loan they had, and the loans have helped them establish themselves as micro entrepreneurs in their area. Their activities range from running cafeterias and small grocery stores, to candy making. Louis K. is the group coordinator and he sells prepaid phone cards. Mobile communications are relatively affordable in the Dominican Republic, and a lot of people own prepaid phones. Phone cards range in price from 50 to 500 pesos (between $1.50 and $12 approximately), and for some people, their mobile phones are their only source of communication (most people in rural areas and urban outskirts cannot afford a landline).

For that, they bought a house that cost a lot of build.  From the time she was a girl, she's had to work hard to help her family and, among the jobs that she's done to earn money, she found that her true vocation is embroidery.  She started by making different fabrics because her creativity had led her to be recognized for that skill at the factories where she worked.  Later, she acquired a special machine for knitting and embroidery which allowed her to continue working--at home now--on clothing brought to her because only she, with her great creativity, could provide the level of decoration required.  Since then, she's been happier because she no longer has to be away from home.  She now has the chance to both work and care for her family.  Next she wants to improve the level of services that she provides with a more specialized machine and instruments that will ease her difficult work, work that on some days requires her to complete 100 to 300 clothing pieces.  Ana likes her working group, a group that's been working with MFP for more than 5 years, and she's grateful for the help they've provided with certain administrative tasks, something that's been very valuable during her time there.

They hope this loan will help them establish their businesses and generate better profits to improve their living conditions.  In San Pedro de Macoris, the employment opportunities are not abundant due to the sugar cane industry collapse and the town's proximity to the capital. (For some industries it's not profitable to establish operations in San Pedro de Macoris, and some people cannot commute to Santo Domingo to work every day due to transportation costs).  \r\n\r\nRamon C. is the group coordinator. He is an electrician and decided to start making power inverters. This generates good profits because power outages are common in the Dominican Republic. Inverters are charged with batteries (the same kind you use in cars), and allow you to run some appliances for a reasonable amount of time.

Thanks to her children who help her with the business, she's able to live happily at home.  Thanks to the opportunities that she's been smart enough to take advantage of over the course of her life, Herminia has been able to educate her children who, in turn, established a shop for their mother so that she would be able to work and not feel isolated, something that depresses most people.  That's how, for 4 years, she's worked tending her grocery, each day, from seven in the morning until nine at night except those days when she closes to sell food.  There's a lot of demand for her meals some evenings and cooking is one of the jobs that she most enjoys.  Herminia would like to continue working in order to cover her everyday needs since \"no lo agrada recibir, sino adquirir\" [you're not grateful for what you receive, only what you buy]; this idea has led her to strive to grow her business and set up a space for bookshop.

Consuelo was established around a sugar cane factory that is no longer operating.

","en":"Maria is a hard-working woman, dedicated to the development and wellbeing of her children, whom she has educated to be professionals. Now she lives alone with her husband and her youngest daughter, with whom she shares her best moments in a home that is full of memories. The wellbeing of her children motivated her to start work very young. The costs of her children\u2019s education were high but worth it. Thanks to her efforts today her children are professionals and have established a store in her home so that Maria could stop working away from home and dedicate herself to her household. For 10 years she has attended her store selling groceries and candies. Thanks to the location, she has good profits everyday, above all in the mornings until noon when most of the mothers and students visit her. Despite her good standing, she requires more products to increase her profits and help her to save and have an economic support for her old age and her husband\u2019s, who is also a hard-worker. He has a locksmith\u2019s shop, and together they proviD. for their future. With her work group she has founded many friendships and she likes doing things with her friends. The uncomfortable part is when it\u2019s necessary to be severe with those that don\u2019t fulfill their responsibilities with assigned payments. For this reason, she solicited her first individual loan from MFP, and in this way has more possibilities to grow as a businesswoman.

The members of this group are very excited about receiving their loans and bringing new life to their businesses. They feel very thankful to be given the opportunity to receive a loan and improve their lives through their own work. \r\n\r\nYolanda P. V. is the group coordinator. She has four children who are all grown up (the youngest is 26 years old). However, they all still live with her and she supports them financially. Her business consists of selling clothing from her house. She purchases clothes in bundles, then sells the clothes, and this activity is what her first loan will be used for. If sales are good, she can sell them all in a month. This bundle will be entirely of children\u2019s clothing, not necessarily because it sells better, but, in Yolanda\u2019s words, \u201cBecause these are the clothes I like to sell.\u201d She thinks the fact that she dedicates her business to only the clothes she likes to sell will make her business progress.  She hopes in the future to buy and sell bundles with bedding (sheets and towels) as well as clothes for adults. \r\n\r\nMatelo C. is the group two coordinator. He has six children who are all living with him. He sells vegetables in a stand at a local market. He buys his vegetables from a large supplier in the same market and sells them in his small stand.  The vegetables he sells the most are carrots and eggplant. Eggplant is a popular food in Dominican Republic because it doesn\u2019t cost much, making it affordable when meat is too expensive.  Also, it serves as a good siD. dish with rice and beans, which is the traditional Dominican meal. Matelo thinks it\u2019s important for a stand in a market to look attractive so that customers are drawn to it. He also thinks a seller must be aware of his customers\u2019 demands because demands vary from person to person. He hopes this first loan with Esperanza International will help him increase his sales and help him set up a larger stand in the market.\r\n\r\nPlease help these new micro entrepreneurs launch their initiatives to generate income and improve their quality of life.

Yanilsa V. is the group coordinator. She has two children and lives with her husband. Her children are nine and four years old. The oldest goes to school and the youngest will start in the next school year. She is a home-to-home seller of clothing and shoes. Her mother owns a convenience store so she will use the money from her second loan to set up a display in her mother\u2019s store, which will allow her to offer her products to a wider clientele. Even though right now she sells clothing, Yanilsa is a college student. She plans to major in Education, concentrating in Elementary Education. She hopes to finish her college education in order to accomplish her dream of setting up an elementary school to teach children. Yanilsa is one of the many examples of Esperanza clients who intend to use their businesses to get to a point in their future where they can give back to their communities. Yanilsa believes education can help a person have a better quality of life, which is why she wants to eventually commit her time to teaching children.

The group members all live in Villa Mella, which is located in the northern outskirts of Santo Domingo, which is Dominican Republic\u2019s capital city. Evelyn R. and Josue A. are the group coordinators. Evelyn has five children. The youngest is 12 years old. All her children still live with her. She sells shoes, which she purchases in Dajabon (a city in the northwest of the Dominican Republic, which is about a 5 \u00bd hour ride from Santo Domingo) as well as in the capital. With this loan, she will buy mostly tennis shoes and sandals. She explains that depending on the time of year, sales increase on a certain kind of shoe (for example, loafers during back-to-school time). Evelyn hopes her profits from selling shoes will allow her to buy a house of her own. This would let her have a more peaceful life. Josue has four children of ages 10, 8, 6 and 3. His current business is selling clothes. He finds greater demand for women\u2019s clothing. Lately, however, he has noticed that people are not buying as much as usual. He will use this second loan to purchase new clothes to sell. During his interview, he commented that he likes the fact that because all the members of his group paid their first loan on time, Esperanza International approved higher loan amounts for them in this second loan cycle. He hopes to continue that trend so he can invest larger amounts in his business and create sustainable growth.

They live in La Compa\u00f1\u00eda Caba\u00f1as in the city of Caacup\u00e9.\r\n\r\nThe group is in their tenth cycle of receiving an average of 578,000 PYG ($113) per member.  They bought products such as rice, milk, meat, noodles, soft drinks, seeds for planting, and new and used clothes.  It requires a lot more effort to market these products in the streets as some of the members do.\r\n\r\nThis group is very united.  Every week end they carry out activities to increase and capitalize upon the group\u2019s savings.\r\n\r\nAll of the group members are grateful to the Fundaci\u00f3n Paraguaya for the support they are receiving.  They are grateful not only for the loans they have received, but also for the good advice.  They appreciate the opportunities offered to create small businesses that generate economic resources and employment for family members.\r\n\r\n1. Maria C. Sells Chicken\r\n2. Victoria B. Kiosk\r\n3.

older children, who help her to attend to the store on the days when she has to leave to make purchases and are very responsible in their work.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Vivian

She, with the help of one of her children, knits clothing using traditional knitting needles an activity she undertakes at home.  Her love of knitting began 25 years ago when she began work in a sweater factory which was like an apprenticeship for her.  Since then, she began to knit independently, applying beautiful touches to her work.  She has a catalogue of her designs which she always shows to prospective customers thereby guaranteeing a sure return.  She also sells to retailers she has gotten to know and, because she has become a fast knitter, can complete up to 10 sweaters per month.  This is the second time that Alejandrina has asked for a loan from MFP.  She is very eager to continue working with her communal bank since it pleases her and renews her commitment to punctual repayments.

is the mother of three children and the wife of Benjamin A..  They are both farmers and work hard for the welfare of their family.  Her family lives simply in the village of Barangay San Lorenzo, Ilagan, Isabela. Her children are Geraldin, twenty-four years old, a college graduate and presently working in DSWD (Department of Social Welfare and Development), Gerlyn, twenty-one years old, also a college graduate, and the youngest is Harron, 19 years old and a high school student.  Pacita is thankful that through their hard work and patience, they are able to eat three times a day and send their children to school.  She prays that their youngest will also finish his college education.  \r\n\r\nPacita manages a small store beside their house.  She has been in this business for ten years and it really helps her family a lot.  She wants her business to become more progressive and with this, she would like to take out a loan of $75 that she needs to purchase different grocery items for her store.  Her goal is to expand her business so she can generate more income, because her income of $7.50 a week is not enough to meet the needs of her family.  Pacita is hoping that her loan will be granted for the development of her business.

D. is fifty-one years old and vending was her chosen business.  This has been the main source of income for the family.  Since her income is not enough to provide all the needs of her children, there came a time when she needed to look for financial assistance to support the education of her children.  \r\n\r\nShe was glad when she learned about the Kiva lenders and she gained hope that she can borrow additional capital for her business.   She is now requesting a loan in the amount of $125 that she will use for her vending business.  Violeta is also planning to start in the hog raising business if she ever has extra money.  She dreams that her younger children will finish their studies and have a better job in the future.  \r\n\r\nShe has seven children: Rosemarie, thirty-one years old and a high school graduate; Rodel, twenty-nine years old and a high school undergraduate; Romalyn, twenty-three years old and in college; Rosel, twenty-one years old and a nursing student; Roby-Ann, eighteen years old and a high school graduate; Jenny Mae, seventeen years old and a high school student; and Richelle, the youngest, is twelve years old and presently in elementary school.  Most of her children were not able to pursue their studies further due to their poor living

The stores are usually operated out of the owner's home, and retail items in small units -- selling single cigarettes, for example.  Sari sari shops fill an important economic and social niche in Filipino life, especially in poor or rural areas.

She started her variety store to serve her neighbors with an initial capital of Php 3,000. The income earned from her business was used to finance her children's education. She applied for this loan to buy food and beverages to maintain her variety store.

","en":"Ravshan J. was born in 1975, he is married and has two children. He finished school and started working as a repairman. He was helping his uncle to repair apartments and houses. But this job turned out to be a little too hard and he then started a business raising cattle. He takes out a loan to buy cattle. His wife watches after the livestock and sells the milk from which she makes small income. Rashvan and his wife plan to expand the cow house and buy a few more cows.

The shops are usually operated out of the owner's home, and retail in small units -- selling single cigarettes, for example.  Sari-sari shops fill an important economic and social niche in Filipino life, often functioning as neighborhood watering holes, especially in poor or rural areas.

She has own store where she sells food products for five years. She mostly sells canned foods such as pickles, sweet peas, mayonnaise and different varieties coffee. Before the new year the sales were good and she sold a lot of inventory because everyone was preparing for the new year and the winter ahead. Right now besides those items she will also start selling soft drinks and she needs a loan for this. Her children are also helping with the business. The products are brought in by the suppliers and if she has extra money she also orders for the store neighbors. Umedajon is grateful to Kiva for the support thanks to which she is expanding her business.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Elena Fedorchuk, Kiva

S., 42, is a villager from Pursat province, where he cultivates rice to earn a living. He puts in two rice crops per year on farmland inherited from his grandparents. Besides his farming business, he also has a job as a requirement worker. His wife works with him in the field as well as raising animals for sale.

They run various businesses, such as selling food condiments, children clothing, fabrics, Wax pagnes (a brand of colorful African cloth), and sugar. They are seeking their first loan from Kiva's partner, Soro Yiriwaso. They plan to use it to buy 15 packs of food condiments, 20 dozen children clothing, 20 pieces of Wax pagnes, and 10 sacks of 50 kg of sugar.\r\n<p>\r\nThey get their supplies from wholesalers at the grand market in Sikasso. The women retail their goods for cash or on credit, at the market and as ambulant saleswomen in the area, to a clientele comprising mostly women.\r\nThey foresee turning a monthly profit of XOF 25'000 (ca US$ 50 ) each, to be used in part to provide for their families. The remainder will be invested in their businesses.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Patrick Stadelmann, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":297642,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy food condiments, children clothing, Wax pagnes, and sugar","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-04-02T12:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rokia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rokia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Setou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aminata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":200000,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-04-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:29:08Z","rounded_local_amount":35082.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033769,"comment":null},{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-05-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:39:37Z","rounded_local_amount":35082.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44621143,"comment":null},{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-06-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:22:07Z","rounded_local_amount":35082.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53020106,"comment":null},{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-07-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:19:41Z","rounded_local_amount":35082.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242860,"comment":null},{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-08-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:43:05Z","rounded_local_amount":35082.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678509,"comment":null},{"amount":70.85,"local_amount":33333.35,"processed_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T03:55:59Z","rounded_local_amount":35082.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87112484,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-04-02T22:57:16Z","paid_date":"2009-10-16T03:55:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":99321,"name":"Maguie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maguie is a 43-year-old woman who lives in Saida, southern Lebanon with her husband and their three children.

Diarra dropped out of school at an early age, to help his parents with their business. For years, Mr. B. Diarra bought and sold cereals at the Bougouni market, but this business was not successful. He thus decided to try another business, namely buying and selling spare parts and lubricants with his elder brother. Having two years of experience, Mr. B. Diarra masters his business and is well-renowned in this field, where he's doing well. He's seeking his first loan from Kiva's partner, Soro Yiriwaso, and intends to buy 20 boxes of 5 cans of motor oil, as well as small spare parts. He gets his supplies in Bamako, the capital of the Republic of Mali. With this loan, Mr. B. Diarra foresees turning a monthly profit of XOF 60'000 (ca US$ 120), which will enable him to expand his business and repay the loan.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Patrick Stadelmann,

The place where she sells is in another province which is very far, so she leaves the rest of the animals at her mother-in-law\u2019s to save having to transport them.  \r\n\r\nThis business has given her more income for her family.  Her husband works far from the city, and many times his salary does not completely cover the household expenses. \r\n\r\n In\u00e9s plans to keep working. She also plans to buy a piece of land near her selling location where she can keep and sell her animals.  This is her first loan with MFP.  She is very happy to be a part of this community bank.  She promises to participate and be an active collaborator in her group.  She will use the loan to buy animals like sheep, pigs and guinea pigs.  This will increase her sales.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":297803,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To increase the number of animals she sells","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-04-04T16:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"In\u00e9s","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":143},{"due_date":"2009-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":143},{"due_date":"2009-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":143},{"due_date":"2009-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":143},{"due_date":"2009-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":143},{"due_date":"2009-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":143},{"due_date":"2009-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":142}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.48},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.48},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.48},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.48},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.48},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.48},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":46.47,"local_amount":143,"processed_date":"2009-04-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:44:34Z","rounded_local_amount":147.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012366,"comment":null},{"amount":46.48,"local_amount":143,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:00:30Z","rounded_local_amount":147.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595954,"comment":null},{"amount":46.48,"local_amount":143,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:45:29Z","rounded_local_amount":147.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990218,"comment":null},{"amount":46.49,"local_amount":143,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:46:37Z","rounded_local_amount":147.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211343,"comment":null},{"amount":46.48,"local_amount":143,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:30:06Z","rounded_local_amount":147.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640856,"comment":null},{"amount":46.48,"local_amount":143,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:42:45Z","rounded_local_amount":147.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080325,"comment":null},{"amount":46.12,"local_amount":142,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:18:06Z","rounded_local_amount":146.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996525,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-04-04T18:14:52Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T03:18:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":99418,"name":"Jeselin","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jeselin tiene 23 a\u00f1os, vive con sus padres y sus hermanos en su casa propia.

Three of her children are in school; the little one is still breastfeeding. She resides at Eguase, a suburb of Moore, in the central part of Ghana. Her husband does not have a permanent job, so the entire household depends on her for food and other minor expenses.\r\n\r\nShe is a food vendor who prepares and sells rice and stew in the area where she lives. Apart from the rice and stew she also sells \u2018chibom\u2019, fried eggs with bread together with tea, at night. Chibom is a term people use when they are having such food. She combines these two businesses by herself. She serves the rice in the morning to afternoon and prepares herself for the evening section. She has been in business for six years now. Initially she solely depended on herself but has realized her strength is not enough to meet the market demand.

Erika vende todas las ma\u00f1anas y todos los d\u00edas de la semana, sus clientes son principalmente obreros y viajeros  que  se detienen en el lugar. Con el paso de los a\u00f1os Erika ha visto la creciente  demanda de su comida, y eso garantiza que tenga ganancias de su trabajo. Cada 15 d\u00edas compra al por mayor sus ingredientes, para ello viaja a la ciudad de Lima para que sea menor su inversi\u00f3n. Para el futuro, Erika tiene grandes proyecciones para su negocio, quiere agrandar su carrito de ventas y tener otro puesto.

","en":"\r\nErika, 31, lives with her husband and children in a rented house.\r\n\r\nFor 10 years she has sold breakfast on a main avenue close to her house.  She started selling with a large bucket and glasses.  Now she has a cart which allows her to transport her breakfasts.  Erika sells every morning and every day of the week.  Her customers are primarily workers and travelers who stop in the area.  \r\n\r\nAs the years have passed Erika has seen the demand for her food grow.  This guarantees that she will have earnings from her work.  Every 15 days she buys her ingredients wholesale.  To do this she travels to Lima in order to spend less.  \r\n \r\n\r\nIn the future Erika has big plans for her business.

For four years she has been selling household products on foot, assisted by her husband, offering her merchandise in far off places in her rural area. The benefit that Nelly grants is that she gives credit and, 15 days later, she returns to collect and sell again. What she offers to her customers depends on the occasion: in this cold season, her customers request blankets. In school season, they request school uniforms and other various articles. For Nelly, this work is profitable because she earns a reasonable profit with each product that she sells so it justifies the effort she and her husband put forth. For the future, Nelly wishes to grow her market, traveling to other places to offer her merchandise. This is the second time that she has taken a loan with MFP. She is very happy to continue a joint effort with her community bank. Her wish is that she continues this work despite difficult circumstances that might crop up. The money that she is requesting is to stock up on more household products which are her working capital.

Abobo is twenty-eight years old and has one daughter.

Mayleen runs a sari-sari shop and plans to use the proceeds of this loan to buy inventory for her store.  \"Sari-sari\" is Tagalog for \"various kinds\" and the shops sell an assortment of basic foodstuffs, beverages, and everyday commodities.  The shops tend to retail items in small units -- selling single cigarettes, for example. Sari-sari shops fill an important economic and social niche in Filipino life, especially in poor or rural areas; they often have chairs or a bench out front and act as neighborhood watering holes.  Mayleen has had her store for two years, and wants to upgrade it to carry more groceries.  She hopes to earn enough income to pay for her daughter's education, and would like her daughter to go to a university some

C. is forty-nine years old and lives in beautiful Pandan, a coastal city on the Sulu Sea located in the north part of Antique Province.

Her youngest son is still in high school, and her two older sons are high school graduates who now work as laborers.\r\nJulieta has two income-generating ventures: she weaves pandan leaves into hats and sleeping mats, and she retails rice.  Pandan is a palm-like plant that has many species, and Julieta's city is said to have derived its name from the plant.  Mats made of pandan, known as \"banig\" in Tagalog, are a famous handicraft of the area; sometimes the mats are woven plain, and at other times the raw materials are dyed and woven into mats with colorful geometrical patterns.\r\nJulieta plans to use the money from this loan disbursed by one of Kiva's field partners, ASHI, to buy raw materials for weaving, and rice for resale.  She says that her participation in ASHI programs has helped her build confidence in herself and in her business skills.  She would like to earn enough so she can afford to make improvements to her

She also grows rice. For this she needed a first loan of $85, which she got from TYM. \r\nBecause of her success at running her business, she has a monthly income of $112.  Unfortunately, that isn\u2019t enough to live on, so she is reliant on the financial help of her children. With the next loan through Kiva, which is $575, she hopes to stop this economic dependence on her children by improving her raising possibilities (built a bigger cote) and by buying animal

Currently, Bat-Orshih lives with his wife and his youngest daughter, who is a local high school student. Bat-Orshih started a small carpentry business in 1990, with just 40,000 MNT of capital ($1 USD=1,500 MNT). He makes wooden furniture, such as chairs, beds, and tables. His clients are mostly from the town where he lives. As the business expands, he would like to acquire more clients from neighboring towns in the province. In the future, he hopes to continue to be able to afford his daughters' college tuition.

Starting in 1988,  Lou\u00efse sold maize, wholesale and retail. 7 years ago, she left this business in favor of the sale of bowls, sets of basins, shoes and other items.

Then, several days later, according to what has been agreed on with the customer, Lou\u00efse comes back to collect her money.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<p> \r\nTajikistan is the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<p> \r\nIMON's History<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which began soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients have a viable business proposition.

Currently Aminjon\u2019s car needs some repairs and he wants to borrow $600 for 12 months. He thanks Kiva and all lenders that make this help possible.   \r\n       \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which began soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a solid business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

As a child he was an excellent student, but upon finishing his studies he was unable to find any work due to the severe economic problems in his country.  Instead, Kodirjon decided to invest his small savings to start his own business whereby he sells rice at the market.  Over time he has expanded his business to the point that the business is now the sole source of income for his family, which consists of his wife and three children.  He explains that there is high demand for his rice because of its excellent quality, size, and flavor.  As a result, Kodirjon is applying for a loan in the amount of $800 in order to buy more goods for resale purposes.  In turn, he expects to generate more income, which will enable him to improve his family's standard of living. <p>\r\n \r\nInformation about Tajikistan:\r\nTajikistan is well known for the following: (1) its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; (2) the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and (3) its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, and Mavlavi Rumi, to name a few.  The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions.  On the other end of the spectrum, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and thus only 7% of the land is arable; accordingly, this confluence of factors has resulted in high levels of unemployment and has forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries (primarily Russia).  Even though the people of Tajikistan are working hard to improve the country's agriculture and manufacturing sectors, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON International's History:\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Sadjida\u2019s dream is to see her children complete their studies.  <p>\r\n\r\nInformation about Tajikistan:\r\nTajikistan is well known for the following: (1) its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; (2) the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and (3) its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, and Mavlavi Rumi, to name a few.  The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions.  On the other end of the spectrum, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and thus only 7% of the land is arable; accordingly, this confluence of factors has resulted in high levels of unemployment and has forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries (primarily Russia).  Even though the people of Tajikistan are working hard to improve the country's agriculture and manufacturing sectors, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON International's History:\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<p> \r\nTajikistan is the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<p> \r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History:<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Maruf expresses his gratitude to everyone supporting him.    \n\nTajikistan\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history and diverse culture, which is a mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet influence, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions. It served as a key post along the Silk Road and marked the end of Alexander the Great's extensive rule. It was the birthplace of the great Persian poet Rudaki and famous Islamic philosopher Ibn Sina. And it is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.\n\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Djalil is married and has two children who he is very proud of, since they are fighting to get ahead. With the faith that his children will go to college someday, he started a business 4 years ago, processing and selling dried apricot in order to make enough money to pay for their schooling. He is experienced in this kind of business, which allows him to expand his clientele day by day. Right now, Djalil is requesting $800 USD for purchasing more dried apricot to process and to sell. With your help, Djalil will be able to feel proud that, through much effort, his children can go to college and become educated people.  \r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history and diverse culture, which is a mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet influence, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions. It served as a key post along the Silk Road and marked the end of Alexander the Great's extensive rule. It was the birthplace of the great Persian poet Rudaki and famous Islamic philosopher Ibn Sina. And it is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.\r\n<p>\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Tukhtasun is 59 years old. He is married and the father of 5 children. Tukhtasun is a hard-working man who has fought to provide for his family and educate his children, who today are working adults, thanks to his example. Tukhtasun is an enterprising man who constantly tries to do things better and to improve day after day. He works hard in his fields where he spends as much time as possible providing the necessary care, fertilizing his land, and spraying to prevent diseases that might affect his yields. <P>\r\n\r\nTukhtasun needs seeds and fertilizers to continue his difficult work, tending his crops so that they can be taken to the capital for sale. That's why he's applying for a loan of 2000 Somoni. Let's be the ones who reach out our hands to help Tukhtasun.    \r\n<P>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

His net profit is 2,500 Hryvnia a month. \n\nAndrey decided to go into this line of business because competition is lacking. He feels comfortable selling this type of inventory. Andrey is a focused entrepreneur looking for growth and further expansion of his venture. He believes an increase in assorted merchandise will guarantee increased sales and consistent development of his business. He is requesting a loan of 1,700 Hryvnia to increase his working capital. \n\nNote: this is a short term express loan that will be repaid very quickly.\n\n\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":298229,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To increase assorted merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UA","country":"Ukraine","town":"Beregovo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"48.216667 22.65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":26,"posted_date":"2009-04-08T19:30:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Andrey","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UAH","disbursal_amount":1700,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1700}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":225,"local_amount":1700,"processed_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T20:22:40Z","rounded_local_amount":1801.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35995996,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-04-08T21:33:01Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T20:22:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":99573,"name":"Omolara","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Omolara is 43 years old and married with three children.

Aminatou was born on October 11, 1957 in SAKETE, a village in PLATEAU County in southern BENIN, and traces her roots to SAKETE.  She is married, and has four children:  2 girls and 2 boys, who are all adults and schooled.  Aminatou lives with her family in AGONGBOMEY, a densely-populated district of the city of Cotonou, the economic capital of B\u00e9nin.  She used to do commerce in jewelry at the grand international marketplace of BENIN.  But she subsequently dropped that business because it required a large investment she isn't in a position to obtain.  And so, she opened a small shop two years ago where she sells various goods (candy, cookies, cans of milk, sardines, and tomatoes, sugar, pasta, soaps for the laundry, dishes, and bath, etc.) and shoes.  She makes her sales along the main path in her district.  Aminatou doesn't have anyone to support.  Her project is to invest in her shop to expand it and to diversify her products.  Customer demand exists and is growing day by day.

The group is just beginning its first loan cycles. Most of the group members have taken out loans before from other financial institutions, but for four members, this will be their very first loan. \r\n\r\nThe clients are involved in a variety of different businesses: baking and selling bread, selling prepared food (like empanadas and stuffed, fried potatoes), selling locally grown vegetables in the jungle city of Puerto M., selling chicken, cutting and selling eucalyptus trees, renting out retail space, selling grains and dried foods, selling yerba mate at a bus stop, raising livestock and driving a bus. \r\n\r\nThe group\u2019s president, Balvina F., is a member of the local bread sellers\u2019 cooperative, in which there are 62 members, including herself. The cooperative gives internal loans to its members, so Balvina has experience in group loans even though this is her first loan from Asociacion Arariwa. When a member of her cooperative breaks the group\u2019s internal regulations, they are punished by being barred from work for one month. \u201cWe\u2019re worse than the law,\u201d she chuckles. Balvina plans to bring this same disciplined approach to Las Amistosas. \u201cWe must pay on time, faithfully every month, and be punctual,\u201d she says. \u201cThe more punctual we are, the better we work together. We must help one another out.\u201d Balvina also has an innovative plan for the group. She sells bread in Urcos\u2019 Plaza de Armas, and says that on weekends and holidays, there are often many visitors looking for a good meal but little in the way of supply. She has proposed to the group that they take turns selling meals like \u201ccuy\u201d (guinea pig) on the Plaza on these occasions in order to generate reserve savings for the group, in case someone falls ill or can\u2019t make a payment for any reason. \r\n\r\nBalvina plans to use her loan to buy bread flour and animal feed for some cows she has on a small farm she owns. Other group members will use their loans to buy potatoes, rice and oil in bulk; to buy vegetables; to buy chickens; to buy eucalyptus trees; to buy a plot of land; to outfit a restaurant, and to buy animal feed. The \u201cLas Amistosas\u201d group has pledged to repay their Kiva loan on time and in full. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2375,"image":{"id":298272,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","use":"Buy bread flour, animal feed, vegetables, oil and rice, chickens, a plot of land, eucalyptus trees and other uses.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Urcos - Quispicanchi - Cusco","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":119,"posted_date":"2009-04-04T03:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Balvina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wiliam Jesus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florencia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marleni Pilar","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felicitas","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teresa Victoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nicanor","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Raimunda Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Modesta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":7400,"loan_amount":2375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1115.63},{"due_date":"2009-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1160.26},{"due_date":"2009-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1206.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1254.94},{"due_date":"2009-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1305.14},{"due_date":"2009-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1357.36}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":358.06},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":372.38},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":387.28},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":402.77},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":418.88},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":435.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":358.05,"local_amount":1115.63,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T11:45:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1126.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35951417,"comment":null},{"amount":372.38,"local_amount":1160.26,"processed_date":"2009-05-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T21:39:01Z","rounded_local_amount":1171.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44409827,"comment":null},{"amount":387.28,"local_amount":1206.67,"processed_date":"2009-06-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T18:06:21Z","rounded_local_amount":1217.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52918261,"comment":null},{"amount":402.78,"local_amount":1254.94,"processed_date":"2009-07-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T11:26:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1266.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63139111,"comment":null},{"amount":419.14,"local_amount":1305.95,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T12:22:44Z","rounded_local_amount":1318.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73564729,"comment":null},{"amount":435.37,"local_amount":1356.55,"processed_date":"2009-09-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T13:07:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1369.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86998331,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-04-06T04:34:17Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T13:07:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":99594,"name":"Christine","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"H.

Christine was born on November 12, 1975 in Cotonou but traces her roots to Porto-Novo, the administrative and political capital of BENIN.  She is married to VIDJENNANGNI Anasthase, an auto mechanic, and she is the mother of a 3-year-old daughter in pre-school.  Christine lives in the home of her in-laws in GBENONKPO, a highly populated district of Cotonou, the economic capital of B\u00e9nin.  She dropped out of school in her fifth year of primary school due to a lack of financial support.  After her marriage, she got started in selling sets of tubs and basins, bowls, and plates.  Her business is booming.  She buys merchandise in Lom\u00e9, the capital of TOGO, a country bordering B\u00e9nin.  Right now, Christine is no longer able to satisfy all the demands of her customers.  This is why she's asking ALID\u00c9 for a third loan, so as to bolster her capital in order to satisfy her customers better.\r\n<p>\r\n<i>ALID\u00c9 means \u201cthere is always a path for the poorest\u201d in Benin\u2019s local language of Fon.

Orphaned by her mother, she dropped out of school early and got registered into an apprenticing workshop for hairdressers in Cotonou.  After five years of apprenticeship in hairdressing, she opened her own salon in her father's house.  She includes along with hairdressing the sale of beauty products, hair extensions, and hair products.  \r\n<p>\r\nRosine is married to ZOUNMENOU Gilbert, a taxi driver.  She is the mother of two boys: Junior, age 7, in his third year of primary school;  and Jude, age 3, in pre-school.

Her husband is the one who supports the family.  \r\n<p>\r\nRosine wants to diversify her business.

Thanks to years of work, her husband was able to buy a car that he uses for work every day.  Florinda decided to dedicate herself to the sale of cosmetics and for the past 5 years she has taken to the streets, catalogs in hand, to visit her friends who have become her most loyal clients.  This has given her the possibility to grow as salesperson and a beauty consultant.  \r\n\r\nBut her costs tends to vary depending on the date and when this happens, she makes knitted objects and stuffed animals to sell at fairs.  This work keeps her occupied the entire day, mostly because she has to collect payments for the products she has distributed.

She belongs to a village bank called 'Independence' and wants to use the loan to buy more bales of used clothing to increase her inventory; however, she normally concentrates on bed sheets and used towels sales.
