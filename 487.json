She lives in Sitio Tuburan, Brgy. Camba-og, Hinigaran, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 1999 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. \r\n\r\nBy working hard in her pottery business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 8,000. Grace is now borrowing PHP 14,000 so that she can continue to fund the operations of her business. This will be her 16th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 14,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Grace aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

D. is a 42-year-old from Malabor, Tibiao, Antique, Philippines. She stands as father and mother to her six children since her husband left them five years ago. Being a single mother, she has difficulty meeting the needs of her family. Four of her children are still studying so she works hard in order to survive. But through her industry and courage, two of her children are already finished college. This business is very important to the family because this is where she gets the money to meet their basic needs and the daily allowance of her children for schooling.\r\n\r\nBautista earns her living with a <i>sari-sari<\/i> store and food vending. They say, \"Life begins at 40.\" These days, people are serious about their businesses. In the last few months, Bautista joined ASHI because she wants to have additional capital for her business, and she like the free training and orientation offered by ASHI. She really appreciates the training because it is a big help to her and expands her dreams for her family.\r\n\r\nBautista's first loan from ASHI was for 5,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) which she used as additional capital for her variety store. Her business improved because she already knew how to handle the business and she is friendly. So, for her second loan, she has requested 10,000 PHP which will be used as additional capital for her sari-sari store and food vending business.  According to her, \"In business, if you are wise, the bigger the investment, the bigger the income.\" She hopes that with the strength given to her by our Almighty, and with the support of ASHI and people around the world, she will be able to finish sending her children to college. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n

She lives in Brgy. La Paz, Bogo, Cebu. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2008 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. \r\n\r\nBy working hard in her Buying and Selling (pigs) and Pig-Fattening businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable.  She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 10,000. Cheryl is now borrowing PHP 20,000 so that she can continue to  fund the operations of her piggery.  This will be her 10th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 13,000, which she paid off well within its term was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Cheryl aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way.\r\n\r\n About NWTF:\r\n\r\n In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

Her husband Jaime, who is 59 years old, has his own store and also helps his wife. The couple has three children who range in age from 26 to 36 years old. \r\n\r\nAlicia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she wanted a better life for her family. With the help of 10 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, she has been slowly lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. She has applied for a new loan, for PHP 17,000, to buy more dried fish and bamboo to sell to her customers. Her goals are to continue to expand her businesses and help her children. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

O. is 50 years old, married to Rose Nafula and they have three children. They live in Bungoma and that's where his business is based.\r\n\r\nJohn runs a bureau that offers secretarial services, e.g., typing, telephone and photocopy services. He also sells stationery in his shop. He is applying for a loan of 40,000 Kenyan shillings to buy a new computer as the one he has is not serving him well.

His prior loans were used for the same purpose, which has improved his life and that of his family by providing them with adequate housing. \r\n\r\nHis dream for the future is to finish construction

She values that the organization has supported her to improve her business; hence her better living standards.\r\n\r\nShe has requested a loan of 25,000 Php to buy another tricycle and some of the money will support the maintenance of it. She hopes to buy more tricycles in the future for better profits. She sees herself venturing into a jeepney (small bus) business in the future.\r\n\r\nHaving this opportunity of loan from KIVA through ASHI will provide a chance to achieve her ambition in life: to renovate their home, provide a good living and financial means for supporting her family, and funding the education of her children. She doesn\u2019t stop dreaming of her children having their own businesses like her. Lucita wants to thank ASHI and Kiva lenders who are granting this loan.

She generates sales every day, as does Timoteo, in order to earn an income.\r\n<p>\r\nTimoteo is requesting a loan so that he can buy basic food products and generate a few more sales in order to survive.  He is grateful for the help FAPE has provided since it is a distinct institution that has been supportive of his work.  His dream is to have his own packing business so that he can ship goods nationally and internationally.  Timoteo has faith in God that his dream can become a reality.

","en":"Do\u00f1a Rosa P., age 20, is a single mother with a sixth graD. education.  She has a five year old daughter and earns her living by manufacturing sweatshirts.  Rosa has years of experience in this business because she has been working since she was a young girl.  With the income she earns, she is able to cover her personal expenses and that of her daughter.  Rosa is solely in charge of the expenses because she does not receive any financial support from the father of her daughter.  Next year her daughter will enroll in school, so her expenses will increase.  She dreams of having a large business so that her daughter can get ahead.  With enthusiasm, the desire to succeed, and the help of a cousin and her neighbors, Rosa organized a group for the purpose of requesting a loan.\r\n<p>\r\nThis Communal Bank is called \u201cSuperaci\u00f3n\u201d (To Overcome), a name that was selected by all of the members with the belief that they can overcome with inner personal strength and the support of their families.  The group consists of eleven women who are engaged in different business activities such as raising animals, manufacturing cooking utensils, weaving napkins, making clothes, and selling daily consumer products.  Rosa will use her loan to buy fabrics so that she can increase her production and generate more income.  Her dream is to grow her business, but she lacks the capital to do so.  She believes this loan will help her accomplish her goals, allowing her to achieve personal development and help her daughter grow."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1600,"image":{"id":630231,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","use":"Operating capital to buy fabrics","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Totonicap\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":113,"posted_date":"2010-10-31T17:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa Francisca ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paula Aj\u00edn ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Santos Estebana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gregoria Mercedes ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Catarina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Santa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sara Noem\u00ed ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Obispa Susana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana Romelia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juliana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-10-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":12700,"loan_amount":1600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":2116.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":2116.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":2116.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":2116.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2116.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2116.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":266.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":266.66},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":266.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":266.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":266.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":266.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":266.67,"local_amount":2116.67,"processed_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-27T09:58:30Z","rounded_local_amount":2149.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182499209,"comment":null},{"amount":266.66,"local_amount":2116.67,"processed_date":"2010-12-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-10T09:34:18Z","rounded_local_amount":2149.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188634814,"comment":null},{"amount":266.67,"local_amount":2116.73,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-26T09:29:03Z","rounded_local_amount":2149.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191377855,"comment":null},{"amount":329.66,"local_amount":2616.69,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:12:31Z","rounded_local_amount":2657.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195795787,"comment":null},{"amount":235.17,"local_amount":1866.69,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:20:41Z","rounded_local_amount":1895.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201237811,"comment":null},{"amount":235.17,"local_amount":1866.55,"processed_date":"2011-04-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:18:04Z","rounded_local_amount":1895.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206104238,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-10-31T20:56:28Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T10:18:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":244197,"name":"Kantu De San Jeronimo Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Nuestros socios, pertenecen al banco comunal \u201cKantu de San Jeronimo\u201d y viven en la ciudad del Cusco.

She says that she has participated in other community banks and with the money her business has grown and she has been able to improve her living conditions.  Her business started with a small stall in the doorway of her home from where she sold deep-fried chicken.  Over time she managed to make the alterations necessary to open a guesthouse.  In addition, she comments that some years ago she received a check up in the doctor's office at Pro Mujer which saved her life since it diagnosed an illness which required an emergency operation.\r\n\r\nThe loan she has requested of 2000 bolivianos will be used to buy supplies for her guest house.

This was a huge challenge because she had to pay them off in two weeks.  Her capacity for work and discipline, as well as her husband\u2019s, were vital for them to start doing well with the store immediately so much so that they even managed to buy the house they lived in and where the store was situated.\r\n\r\nThe store is their main source of income and the couple\u2019s place of employment; they still work together.  Sometimes their oldest son helps out because he\u2019s studying in the university.\r\n\r\nHer kindness and good customer service is such that customers come daily even from far away to buy goods and merchandise that Moyran and her husband have in stock in their store and which, for the most part, constitute basic household items and miscellany.\r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and she hopes to use it to increase stock inventory taking advantages of discounts offered for cash purchases.  Later on she hopes to have a location for the store since it currently operates in the front part of her house and she\u2019d like to separate work from family life.\r\n\r\nShe will use her Kiva funds

When Napisa was 15, she was given in marriage in accordance with antiquated nomadic traditions which fortunately quite rarely exist in present times. However, she was able to finish school and with an infant at her side, entered Trade College. \r\n\r\nThe salary of her husband, who was a policeman, was too low and didn\u2019t meet the essential needs of the growing family. In order to find an additional means of subsistence, Napisa began to work as a sales assistant. Later, she made it a career and took on the position of head of the local department store. \r\n\r\nThis experience became the basis for Napisa\u2019s own business in reselling goods, which she started in 2008. Together with her elder daughter, she opened a small grocery store and managed to develop it. Now Napisa is applying for a loan of 50,000 Kyrgyz Soms to broaden her business by expanding her range of products. With the revenue from this investment, Napisa plans to open one more sales point at the market for her daughter.  \r\n\r\nBai-Tushum and Partners uses Kiva funding to target the especially vulnerable population.

Today, she is requesting to borrow US$ 1000 from Kiva partner Ameen s.a.l. to improve her business and increase her shop inventory.

They decided to give it this name because they meet in a small cabin at the group representative\u2019s house.  This story is about Ms. Natividad G. G., since she is the representative of the group.\r\n\r\nShe is 37 years old, married to Porfirio, with whom she has 2 children: Jos\u00e9 Alberto and Karen Arlet.  Both children are in primary school, one in sixth grade and the other in fourth grade.  She has had a grocery store for 4 years.\r\n\r\nShe chose this activity because she had to find a way to help her husband with the household expenses and their children\u2019s education.  She also wanted to improve their standard of living and, the fact that the business is a good income producer, is the reason she decided on this type of enterprise.  \r\n\r\nShe plans to use the loan she received to continue investing in her store.  She would like to purchase additional merchandise such as: salt, sugar, rice, beans, soups, beverages, waters, juices, eggs, oil, soap, toilet paper, candles, and many other products that she\u2019s missing, in order to have a good variety of merchandise and a well-supplied store.\r\n\r\nHer business is serving her well, as her earnings allow her to support her children in their studies as well as to improve their quality of life.  In addition, she is saving to buy a computer for her children so they can use it to do their homework. \r\n\r\nNati states that her goal is to expand her business, and she would like to build a larger locale in order to grow much more and convert it into a store that is well-stocked and generates more income for her.  She is also thinking about installing a pharmacy, as there are none in her community.\r\n\r\nShe states that she knows her associates very well, and comments that they are very responsible, hard-working and trustworthy people who have a great desire to get ahead and succeed.  Likewise, at no point have they defaulted or been late with their loan payments.\r\n\r\nShe gives thanks to the lenders on Kiva, for giving her this opportunity and their trust but most of all, for believing in her.  Thanks to their help, she can invest in her business and look forward to a brighter future.  \r\n\r\nThe members of the group and the activities they carry out are:\r\n\r\nIsabel L.
