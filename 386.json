She also prepares food, which is sold in her oldest child\u2019s house.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, she worries a lot about not being able to count on help from her family each time she works on her farm.  She needs to hire workers to speed up her work.  Of her two activities, she likes farming the best.  This is because she will be able to get a good reward during the harvest, which allows her to cover the household expenses.  Also, above all, she can collaborate economically with her children who are looking for a better future for her grandchildren.\r\n\r\nLater on she wants to plant citrus fruits, bananas, and avocados.  She hopes to have them fertile so that she can leave them to her children.\r\n\r\nThis is her third loan with MFP.

She is considered a woman of \"a thousand trades\" because, in order to provide for her family, she never rests. For this reason, she has been working in agriculture for 20 years and also prepares food, breeds and sells guinea pigs and pigs, and sells beauty products, all of which are very beneficial to her because she has many acquaintances who are among her favorite customers. Her favorite of the tasks she undertakes is harvesting the delicious mandarins that she grows, as they are sold both in her local market and in the city, and bring in a little extra profit. On the other hand, her husband works for the \"Water For All\" program, so he is responsible for the household expenses.

Perhaps this is why she protects from harm her crops of avocados, bananas, and citrus fruits. Her husband accompanies her every working day. Along with this job, she raises hens and pigs which are then sold in the city market and whose earnings help her with some inexpected problems since she doesn't want to take her savings that are intended for the purchase of productive land where she will renew and alternate new products that grow in the area.

Currently, they have already built a part with the bond granted by the government but it failed to provide some finishing touches so that his mother feels comfortable and safe in her home.

They have 4 children together, of whom three still live with them in the house they own.  He has dedicated himself to agriculture for more than 30 years.  His wife assists him, which makes his work less difficult.  However, in harvest time, it is his children who help him gather the fruit.  Later, they are transported and sold, a process he enjoys because it is the actual reward for his hard work.  What he enjoys most is keeping his banana, soursop, avocado and citrus plants healthy.  Likewise, he installs traps for the rodents and insects that affect his crops.  In the future, he hopes to start a food sales business in his home that his wife could tend to instead of sacrificing herself on the farm.  This is his third credit with MFP, and he assures us that he feels very content within his cooperative bank because he learns something new at every meeting.  They help him to get ahead, and the group is very united and supportive of each other.

She is 63 years old. Ignacia is the group leader of a 3-member group loan offered by PMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nIgnacia is married and has 4 adult children. To make a living, Ignacia owns & operates a business selling food, primarily snacks & other delicacies, that she sells in the local community. Ignacia has been engaged in her business for over 4 years and earns approximately 2,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Ignacia joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Ignacia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. Ignacia is requesting a new loan of 3,000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be the 3rd loan taken out by Ignacia from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

With the loan she is applying for and the savings that she has she will buy a mototaxi that she will rent out to generate more income.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Richard Brown, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":525234,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","use":"Purchase of a mototaxi.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-04-18T21:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":133.24},{"due_date":"2010-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":138.57},{"due_date":"2010-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":144.11},{"due_date":"2010-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":149.87},{"due_date":"2010-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":155.87},{"due_date":"2010-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":162.11},{"due_date":"2010-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":168.59},{"due_date":"2010-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":175.34},{"due_date":"2011-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":182.35},{"due_date":"2011-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":189.64},{"due_date":"2011-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":197.22},{"due_date":"2011-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":203.09}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.63},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.44},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.46},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.55},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.74},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.01},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.37},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.82},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.37},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.03},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":46.63,"local_amount":133.24,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:55Z","rounded_local_amount":133.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751943,"comment":null},{"amount":48.5,"local_amount":138.57,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:53Z","rounded_local_amount":138.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151934398,"comment":null},{"amount":50.44,"local_amount":144.11,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:37:08Z","rounded_local_amount":144.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159673169,"comment":null},{"amount":52.46,"local_amount":149.87,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:50Z","rounded_local_amount":150.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166886995,"comment":null},{"amount":54.55,"local_amount":155.87,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:31Z","rounded_local_amount":156.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172154012,"comment":null},{"amount":447.42,"local_amount":1278.34,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:14:41Z","rounded_local_amount":1279.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449297,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-04-19T14:50:46Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T15:14:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":193570,"name":"Zenaida","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Zenaida B. is from the village of Libertad Bajo, Sinacaban, Misamis Occidental.

year- old Flor A. aims to support the education of her three children until they graduate from college and have their own careers. Her eldest child is 15 years old and has graduated from high school\/secondary school. In June (opening of classes), she will be entering college and will be incurring larger expenses for tuition, fees, uniforms, and other expenses related to her education.  It is good that Flor's two younger children are only seven and eight years old and yet in primary school. Expenses are somehow too much for Flor and her husband to bear. \r\n<p>\r\nFlor and her husband have been in a rice farming business since they started their own family. The land they use for that business is rented from someone in their village. Before Flor became a member of ASHI, the only capital she had to finance her business was borrowed from wealthy people in their village. The owner of the land takes a percentage from their harvest, and so did the person who lent them money. At the end of the day, all that is left for Flor and her family is just enough for their consumption.\r\n<p>\r\nWith the growing expenses of her family as her children grow older, Flor wants to improve her family's economic status by growing her business and no longer borrowing money from usurious money lenders who charge huge interest rates. She felt very lucky that she was able to join ASHI and had the opportunity to request a loan that has the smallest interest rate. With the loans she is requesting now and can request in the next months or years, the life of her family will improve and her dream ensuring that her children graduate from college will be achieved.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":525254,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase seedlings and fertilizers, and to rent tractors and other farming equipment for rice planting","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Sebaste, Antique, Philippines","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":124,"posted_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:22Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Flor","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":9000,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":360},{"due_date":"2010-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":360},{"due_date":"2010-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":360},{"due_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":360},{"due_date":"2010-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":360},{"due_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":360},{"due_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":360},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":360},{"due_date":"2010-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":360},{"due_date":"2010-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":360},{"due_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":360},{"due_date":"2010-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":360},{"due_date":"2010-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":360},{"due_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":360},{"due_date":"2010-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":360},{"due_date":"2010-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":360},{"due_date":"2010-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":360},{"due_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":360},{"due_date":"2010-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":360},{"due_date":"2010-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":360},{"due_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":360},{"due_date":"2010-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":360},{"due_date":"2010-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":360},{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":360},{"due_date":"2010-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":360}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":63,"local_amount":2520,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:33:44Z","rounded_local_amount":2797.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144643558,"comment":null},{"amount":45,"local_amount":1800,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:03:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1998,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151825451,"comment":null},{"amount":36,"local_amount":1440,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:05:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1598.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159565208,"comment":null},{"amount":45,"local_amount":1800,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:20:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1998,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166773990,"comment":null},{"amount":36,"local_amount":1440,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:24:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1598.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172042696,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-05-02T12:23:30Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T09:24:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":193575,"name":"Alicia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alicia G., 61, is making sure that her family has enough provisions for their daily needs.

She uses the money she borrows to expand and improve her businesses, which helps her to consistently pay her dues.     \r\n\r\nTo ensure the success of her businesses, she would like to apply for a PHP 50,000 loan. This amount will be used as a source of added capital for her expanding businesses.

With the opportunity to receive a loan, their family can have a business that everybody can work in and have earnings from. Since Nema\u2019s two sons are into fishing, Nema decide to support them financially by using the loan from ASHI to make their business grow and become profitable. Now, Nema is requesting for a much larger loan because she wants to purchase a motorboat for her sons to manage. She is the one who sells their fish to people in their village and in the market. \r\n<p>\r\nNema hope that one day their business will be profitable and sustainable enough for her only daughter to

C. is from the village of Palilan, Jimenez, Misamis Occidental. She is 50 years old. Rosalinda is married and has 6 adult children. To make a living, Rosalinda owns & operates a business venture making and selling \"chicharon\" (fried pork rinds) in the local community. Rosalinda has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Rosalinda joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and to have the ability to engage in business activities. Rosalinda has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Rosalinda is requesting a new loan of 15000 PHP which will be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. This will be the third loan taken out by Rosalinda from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":524685,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

B., 46, is making sure that her family has enough for their daily needs. Married to Manuel B., a watch technician, she is blessed with two children. She makes sure that she helps her husband earn so that their family can have a better life.  She has been managing her variety store while also selling halo-halo (native Filipino dessert, made up of shaved ice, sweetened milk, a variety of sweet beans, shredded coconut, palm nuts, topped with sweetened jackfruit and caramel flan) peanut butter and charcoal. Her main customers are her neighbors who still are using the old ways of cooking.\r\n\r\nOfelia has been a regular member of Center for Community Transformation* (CCT) for more than a year now. She regularly attends weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she was able to borrow quite a few times in CCT\u2019s Cooperative.  She is consistent in paying her dues because she uses the money she borrows to expand and improve her businesses.     \r\n\r\nTo ensure the success of her business, she would like to apply for a PHP 18,000 loan. This amount will be used as a source of added capital to her expanding business by buying raw ingredients needed to continue production of her peanut butter.

Married to Jose S., a bus driver, Nieva is blessed with three children. She makes sure that she helps her husband earn so that their family can have a better life.  She has been into newspaper sales for quite some time now. She mainly buys and sells tabloids, newspapers and magazines.\r\n\r\nNieva has been a regular member of the Center for Community Transformation* (CCT) for more than a year now. She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she has been able to borrow twelve times in CCT\u2019s Cooperative.  She is consistent in paying her dues because she has used the money she has borrowed to expand and improve her business.     \r\n\r\nTo ensure the continued success of her business, Nieva is applying for a PHP 40,000 loan. This money will be used to buy more magazines, newspapers and tabloids for selling. Nieva dreams that her business will continue to grow so that she can provide for her children\u2019s education, and have a long and comfortable life with her entire family.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance

G., 43, is making sure that her family has enough provision for their daily needs. Married to Fernando G., a meat vendor, Emily is blessed with five children. She makes sure that she helps her husband earn so that their family can have a better life.  She has been in the meat vending business for quite some time now. She buys mostly live pigs\/hogs and sells their meat in the market.\r\n\r\nEmily has been a regular member of Center for Community Transformation* (CCT) for more than a year now. She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she has been able to borrow three times in CCT\u2019s Cooperative.  She is consistent in paying her dues because she has used the money she has borrowed to expand and improve her business.     \r\n\r\nTo ensure the continued success of her business, Emily is applying for a PHP 8,000 loan. This money will be used to buy more pigs that she can sell in the market.

A smiling giant of a woman (she is seen raising her hand on the picture), currently in her 11th loan cycle, she is a 36-year-old widow, the mother of seven children all attending school: four in the primary and three in the secondary school system.\r\n\r\nHer husband passed away 25 January 2005 in Kigali (Rwanda) following a prolonged lung-related illness. She has been the sole support of her children these past five years, which weighs heavily on the rapid expansion of her business.\r\n\r\nHer business is free-style in nature, itinerant without a fixed location. She provides bed sheets, children\u2019s clothing, pagnes and boubous (colourful West-African clothing), and gold jewelry to all who are interested. It has now been five years since she began an activity known as \u201clutte-lutte pita pita\u201d.\r\n\r\nShe used to live in Kigali, where most of her in-laws reside, and following her husband\u2019s death, without any savings, she began weaving clothes and tablecloths, etc. The earnings from this activity (craft) enabled her to move from Rwanda to the Democratic Republic of Congo with her children, where with her remaining $50 she was able to settle in a guesthouse.\r\n\r\nShe started to trade in tomatoes, gasoline, salt, milk, powdered detergent (OMO). Then she learned that the Hekima MFI provided loans without collateral, and she was granted her first reinforcement loan.\r\n\r\nShe had just re-established some financial balance when she became one of many victims of the 8 July 2009 fire that destroyed over 900 homes in Goma, inside the Birere shanty-town.\r\n\r\nWith the Hekima MFI loan Kapinga M. wishes to increase her turnover by buying 6 pairs of bedsheets, a half-dozen gold chains (locally called \u201cGarantie manzanza\u201d), a half-dozen quality dresses from Congo Brazzaville, and six pagnes.\r\n\r\nShe is also an Evangelist acolyte in a local church (Christ is King) and sometimes participates in \u201cSpiritual Combat\u201d, a Christian revivalist ministry.\r\n\r\nShe is comfortable with how her business is going, and in the future envisions buying a plot of land as inheritance for her children and eventually renting out as a property owner. Additionally she hopes to see all of her children finish their studies with diplomas that will serve them in their future.\r\n\r\nKapinga M. thanks the Hekima MFI for the loans she has received without any collateral because that is what enabled her to meet her children\u2019s needs. She was finally able to enjoy relief and financial stability for the first time since her husband\u2019s death, thanks to Hekima\u2019s loans.\r\n\r\nThe Hodari loan group is made up of 15 members, for the most part women.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ren\u00e9 McConnell, Kiva

He is a high school graduate but could not continue his education through college due to poverty.\r\n\r\nFor 11 years, he has been selling used clothes at the Vai town market close to downtown Monrovia, Liberia. Mickey started selling with 14,000 Liberia dollars he got from his friends. He always sells good used things and he sells them on time in order encourage customers to continue returning.\r\n\r\nMickey plans to use his 6,000 Liberian dollar portion of this 30,000 Liberian dollar group loan to buy more used clothes for sale. He dreams of building a shop and becoming an importer.

She lives with her husband and their children in Wayerma II, one of several populous neighborhoods in Sikasso (third administrative region of the Republic of Mali).\r\n\r\nMrs. Karidia B. is a trained caregiver who has never practiced as such. Four years ago she began trading various items she sells in a store located in the front of her home: mineral water, eggs, cigarettes, candy, matches, chewing-gum, powdered milk, tea, sugar, etc. She is quite in demand by her customers for the quality of her products.\r\n\r\nTo satisfy an increasing number of customers, she decided three years ago to join the Soro Yiriwaso MFI. After four group loans in a neighbourhood women\u2019s association (the Benkadi Association of Wayerma I), she is now requesting a third individual loan. All preceding loans have been correctly reimbursed.\r\n\r\nWith this loan she will buy: four cartons of various cigarettes, 10 packages of chewing-gum, two cartons of powdered milk (in bags), 10 large packages of tea, one bag of sugar, 10 packages of sweets, four cartons of Diago mineral water, 20 matchboxes, etc.\r\n\r\nShe gets her supplies from local wholesalers before selling them retail, for cash or credit, to customers from the area and particularly the young. She hopes to reach monthly earnings of 200,000 FCFA which will be used to increase her working capital, share family expenses, reimburse her loan and invest the remainder in her business. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ren\u00e9 McConnell, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":525502,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Buy various general store products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-04-18T20:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":850,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Karidia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":400000,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2010-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2010-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2011-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":80000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":170}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":170,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2010-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:34Z","rounded_local_amount":82339.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144779200,"comment":null},{"amount":170,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:33Z","rounded_local_amount":82339.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159699518,"comment":null},{"amount":170,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:40:55Z","rounded_local_amount":82339.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172180591,"comment":null},{"amount":170,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:40:25Z","rounded_local_amount":82339.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182613364,"comment":null},{"amount":170,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2011-01-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-17T00:57:13Z","rounded_local_amount":82339.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191606082,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-04-20T14:12:35Z","paid_date":"2011-02-17T00:57:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":193691,"name":"Seguku A Lubwama Teddy Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"L.

In common with the other group members, she hopes to make an average monthly profit of 13,500FCFA, of which part will be saved and the rest invested in the business. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Le Bras, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":525518,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase of non-alcoholic drinks","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-04-18T20:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Djeneba ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ramata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sali ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Absetou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marim ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":350000,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":58333.33},{"due_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":58333.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":58333.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":58333.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":58333.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":58333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.83},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.84},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.83},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.83},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.84},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":120.83,"local_amount":58333.33,"processed_date":"2010-04-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:15:32Z","rounded_local_amount":58525.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136746638,"comment":null},{"amount":120.84,"local_amount":58333.33,"processed_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:38Z","rounded_local_amount":58525.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144779203,"comment":null},{"amount":120.83,"local_amount":58333.33,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:16:52Z","rounded_local_amount":58525.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151961404,"comment":null},{"amount":120.83,"local_amount":58333.33,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:47Z","rounded_local_amount":58525.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159699521,"comment":null},{"amount":120.84,"local_amount":58333.33,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:58:24Z","rounded_local_amount":58525.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166913421,"comment":null},{"amount":120.83,"local_amount":58333.35,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:40:59Z","rounded_local_amount":58525.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172180592,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-04-18T23:46:48Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:40:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":193700,"name":"Lubowa B Magoba Phibe Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"M.

etc.\r\n\r\nWanting to increase their working capital, the group members decided to collaborate with the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso and are now on their very first solidarity loan.\u00a0\r\n\r\nAwa C. intends to use her loan for buying 200 kg of fresh onions.\u00a0 She stocks up in N\u2019gassola and in Tissala.\u00a0 Generally accepting cash, she resells her fresh onions out of her home and at the weekly fair in S\u00e9gou, \u00a0 \r\n\r\nAwa plans on making a monthly profit of 17,000 francs CFA that will be used to repay her loan, to take part in covering certain family expenses, and participating in societal events (marriages, baptisms, and funerals.)\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva

They are on average 37 years old with four children, and all live in Farabougou, a village in the T\u00e9ss\u00e9r\u00e8la  Rural Community (4th administrative region of Mali). They became acquainted through family ties, marriage, as neighbours and through their commercial activities.\r\n\r\nThe Ti\u00e8ssiri group is requesting its first group loan with Soro Yiriwaso, and focuses on trading cereals, like Mariam C., who chose the peanut market niche. The group members decided to collaborate with the institution with the aim to diversify and satisfy their customers.\r\n\r\nMariam will use her portion of the loan to buy three bags of unshelled peanuts, which she purchases in N\u2019gassola and Tissala. The process depends on the variety of peanut: she shells and sorts the \u201ctiga dj\u00e8ni\u201d before selling them retail, whereas part of the unshelled \u201ctiga ba\u201d is grilled or boiled, then dried according to the customer\u2019s requests.\r\n\r\nShe resells her peanuts from her home, throughout the village with help from her children, and on rare occasions at the weekly market fair in Segou, for cash or credit, to men, women and children customers.\r\n\r\nMariam hopes to achieve monthly earnings of 19,000 FCFA which will be used to reimburse her loan, contribute to some family expenses, participate in social festivities (weddings, baptisms, and funerals), increase her working capital, and purchase a few kitchen utensils in view of preparing the young girls\u2019 wedding dowries.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ren\u00e9 McConnell, Kiva

Patrick is 39 years old and a high school graduate. He is single and has four children aged from 12 to 20 years old. All of his children attend school, with the youngest in elementary school, and the eldest in junior high.  He also helps take care of two siblings.\r\nPatrick has been running a tailoring business for ten years. His business is located at the Paynesville Red Light Market. He started his business with 7,000 LRD and now has 20,000 LRD as working capital. He faces challenge from many other competitors in the same business. \r\nPatrick says that his sales are booming due to his good manner of approach and his smiling face. His hope is for his business to grow into a large shop, and he plans to use his 6,000 LRD portion of this 30,000 LRD group loan to purchase more cloth, thread and other tailoring materials.

This area is known for its religious festivals, and is located in the Lambayeque province, about 1\u00bd hours from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nFor the past three years, he has dedicated himself to providing auto repair services from a small workshop in the area where he lives.  There, he tends to customers very day who seek him out for help with their mechanical problems.  He aims to carry out his work with great care and efficiency so that his customers continue to choose him for their repair needs.\r\n\r\nGiven the amount of time he has been in business, his tools are deteriorating and can no longer be used.  For this reason, Julio finds himself having to appeal to Edpyme Alternativa for a loan of 1,500 Peruvian soles.  He plans to invest the loan into purchasing new tools to replace the old ones, and therefore be able to more efficiently continue with his work.\r\n\r\nJulio is a person who very much enjoys his line of business and, because of this, he has given it a great deal of dedication so it will continue to grow.  His greatest wish is to start an enterprise selling replacement car parts.  He has worked with our institution previously, and has demonstrated punctuality and responsibility from the moment he assumes his installment payments.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by

She lives with her husband in their own house. For the past 10 years, she has worked selling milk in her city's central market. Every morning when she goes to her sales stall, her customers are already waiting to buy the milk she offers. Her routine starts with the milking of her cows and then the process of separation to produce the milk that she sells. At the end of the day, she goes home to take care of the other animals she raises. Parallel to this, she also grows corn and potatoes, which she uses for her family's own consumption. She finds her work satisfying, and she plans to expand it by purchasing more animals. Her work also allows her to keep busy all the time and feel self-sufficient. This is her fifth loan with MFP, and she promises to be very responsible with her payments. She believes this support will be very useful for the progress of her business. She will use the loan she is requesting to invest in buying a calf to raise into a highly productive milk cow. She would also like to buy sacks of fertilizer to grow alfalfa, which she will use as feed for her animals.   \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":525639,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Buying a calf as well as sacks of fertilizer to grow alfalfa","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-04-18T22:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Agustina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":165}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.63},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.62},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.63},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.62},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.63},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":62.63,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:40:00Z","rounded_local_amount":177.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751944,"comment":null},{"amount":62.62,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:59Z","rounded_local_amount":177.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151934399,"comment":null},{"amount":62.63,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:37:15Z","rounded_local_amount":177.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159673170,"comment":null},{"amount":62.62,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:58Z","rounded_local_amount":177.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166886996,"comment":null},{"amount":62.63,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:39Z","rounded_local_amount":177.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172154013,"comment":null},{"amount":61.87,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:15:00Z","rounded_local_amount":175.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449298,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-04-19T00:33:27Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T15:15:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":193763,"name":"Ablan Novignon","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Cette femme a commenc\u00e9 en 2003 le commerce de charbons de bois, actuellement son stock est en baisse raison pour laquelle elle sollicite son tout premier cr\u00e9dit de WAGES afin d\u2019acheter  6 sacs de charbons de bois pour gonfler son stock.

She plans to use this loan to invest in her nail salon business by purchasing more acrylic nails, as well as women's underwear and inexpensive jewelry to sell to her clients. She will use the profits to invest in a vehicle to make her life easier, as well as saving toward her long term goal of owning her own home. She thanks you all for your support.

She is the chief of personnel for the Municipality of Wanchaq. Moreover, she owns two kiosks (one in the Plaza de Armas in Cuzco, and one in a smaller plaza called \"Regocijo\"), run by two employees, where she sells jewelry. In large part due to her tremendous work ethic, she has successfully run this business for five years. Yovanna tells us that the recent torrential rainstorms have caused a slowdown in tourist activity in Cuzco, which has in turn caused her business to suffer. She is extremely hard-working, and always looks for opportunities to move forward and provide a better future for her children. Yovanna is requesting this loan to purchase additional merchandise, specifically jewelry and silver goods. She belongs to the Asociacion Arariwa \"Los Diamantes\" community bank.

She lives with her husband, her co-spouses, and their children in a big extended traditional family in M\u00e9dine, a working-class neighborhood of the town of Sikasso (third administrative region of Mali).\r\n\r\nNot having had the good fortune to progress at school for socio-economic reasons, Madame D. began early on to earn her living, notably by selling clothing and various other items coming from Bobo Dioulasso and Bamako (from Burkina Faso and Mali respectively); she has done this for 20 years. \r\n \r\nShe is much in demand among her clientele due to the quality of her products. She does ambulant sales in the various professional buildings of the town and her business is doing great. \r\n\r\nWishing to satisfy her ever-growing clientele, she decided to join the MFI Soro Yiriwaso about 3 years ago. After 3 solidarity loans (group loans) with a women's group from her neighborhood, she is now on her first individual loan. \r\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \r\nWith this loan she intends to buy 15 pieces of colored damask, 10 lengths of wax-brand African print cloth, and 4 sets of sheets. She expects to make a monthly profit of 150,000 F CFA from this loan. The profit will be used essentially to increase her working capital, contribute to family expenses, and pay the interests on the loan, investing any remainder into her business. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":525653,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Traveling Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"purchase of clothing for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-04-19T15:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alimata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":300000,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2010-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":150000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":312.5,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:34Z","rounded_local_amount":151359.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159699531,"comment":null},{"amount":312.5,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:41:14Z","rounded_local_amount":151359.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172180602,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-04-19T18:49:06Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:41:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":193770,"name":"Kokou","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Ce monsieur exerce comme activit\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9ratrice de revenu le commerce en d\u00e9tail de cartes de recharges,il r\u00e9alise de bonnes recettes, pour mieux diversifier son commerce il a impliqu\u00e9 2 personnes de sa famille et a associ\u00e9 le service t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique \u00e0 son activit\u00e9.

She lives in Cerro del Marqu\u00e9z, Valle D. Chalco Solidaridad in the state of Mexico.  She is an active member of UD. Estrellita.\r\n\r\nAna Lilia has been selling robes, overalls, and reflective vests.  She began selling these articles out of necessity, now that her children have started school and her husband\u2019s income was not enough to cover expenses.  Due to her economic situation, she decided to look for a loan.  She learned of Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad through a friend, who invited her to join the group.  This motivates her very much because it provides her the opportunity of obtaining a loan to invest in merchandise and increase her earnings.  This way she will be able to become more economically solvent.\r\n\r\nHer priority at the moment is the education of four of her five children.  They currently attend school; her fifth child is only a year old.  Ana Lilia hopes to better her quality of life through this business and she is very grateful for this assistance.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are:\r\n\r\nMa Trinidad \u2013 Shoe and grill

Don Reynaldo began with few products and with a strong desire to grow to offer all construction products, since demand is high.  His goal is to make the hardware store locale bigger in order to invest in paint, hardware, lamps, and zinc, among other products, to increase sales. He hopes to do this with the financing since it offers him conditions that are very beneficial to him.   <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ellen Donohue, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":525690,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Hardware","sector":"Retail","use":"He will buy paint, hardware, lamps, and zinc since he has few of these products and they sell well.

She has been in this business for 20 years. She started her business with 2,500 Liberian dollars and now has a working capital of 40,500 Liberian dollars. Her business is located on Randall Street, in downtown Monrovia.\r\n\r\nShe says many customers get attracted to her business because she sells quality goods and approaches customers in a good manner. She hopes to increase her business by using her 8,000 Liberian dollar portion of this 40,000 Liberian dollar group loan to buy more used clothes.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn the photo that accompanies this profile, Esther W. is holding the sign.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAbout LEAP:\r\n\r\nThe Local Enterprise Assistance Program (LEAP) is Liberia 's largest and oldest continuously operating microfinance institution, with 13 branches across the country.

She plans to purchase a truckload of coal with the loan she is requesting.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":525734,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fuel\/Firewood","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase more coal.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-04-19T11:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Antonia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":188},{"due_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":188},{"due_date":"2010-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":188},{"due_date":"2010-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":188},{"due_date":"2010-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":188},{"due_date":"2010-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":188},{"due_date":"2010-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":188},{"due_date":"2010-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":184}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.93},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.94},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.93},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.93},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.94},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.93},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.93},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.47}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":68.93,"local_amount":188,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:38:26Z","rounded_local_amount":195.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136718261,"comment":null},{"amount":68.94,"local_amount":188,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:48Z","rounded_local_amount":195.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751947,"comment":null},{"amount":68.93,"local_amount":188,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:03:17Z","rounded_local_amount":195.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151934402,"comment":null},{"amount":137.87,"local_amount":376,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:30Z","rounded_local_amount":390.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166886999,"comment":null},{"amount":137.86,"local_amount":376,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:13:52Z","rounded_local_amount":390.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449301,"comment":null},{"amount":67.47,"local_amount":184,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:01:33Z","rounded_local_amount":191.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588033,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-04-24T22:22:00Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T15:01:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":193808,"name":"Marisol Del Socorro","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La joven Marisol de 24 a\u00f1os de edad, es soltera  labora como docente de educaci\u00f2n primaria desde hace 10 a\u00f1os, empezando sus labores como alfabetizadora.\n\nEsta solicitando su 4to cr\u00e8dito  para comprar materiales de construcci\u00f2n y asi construir una habitaci\u00f2n y asi tener mayor privacidad en el hogar puesto que aun no se ha casado y vive en casa de sus padres.

The full name of this locality is San Lu\u00eds de Cumbe, and it is located in the southeast part of the city of Cuenca.  The majority of residents are dedicated to farming and raising livestock.  This bank is comprised of enterprising women who are always in search of a better standard of living.  They are managing this through their daily work, which makes them very proud.  On this occasion, we are accompanied by Mr. Eulogio Rojas, Regional Coordinator for Azuay, together with our other members. \r\n\r\nDigna C. is one of our own.  She lives in a newly completed home in the San Vicente community, along with her husband who works in construction.  They have three children, ages 4, 3 and 1.  Digna is 23 years old, and has dedicated herself to embroidery for the past eight years, an art form that she learned from her mother.  She works alone from her house, dividing her time between her craft and tending to the household chores.  She doesn\u2019t have a fixed schedule, as her work can vary depending on the number of orders she has.  She also raises guinea pigs and chickens, both for the family\u2019s consumption and to sell in the event they find themselves in a financial bind.  This is the fifth loan cycle for this cooperative bank, and the loan requested would be used to invest in more guinea pigs and chickens as she would like to raise additional animals.\r\n\r\nRosa Alejandrina P. is 43 years old, and another member of this bank.  She lives with three of her five children, as the two oldest kids are married and living independently.  Her 18-year old son works in construction, helping to support the household.  Her 15-year old daughter helps her with the house and caring for the animals.  Only her youngest is studying at the local school.  Her husband has lived abroad for eleven years, helping them out financially.  Thanks to their efforts and sacrifice, they managed to build their own home.  They are in their fourth cycle with the cooperative bank, thanks to the invitation from a member.  With previous loans, she bought some guinea pigs and chickens, but she also dedicates herself to embroidery of traditional garments.  She learned this skill on her own, and has been doing it for twelve years.  She will use the loan to buy threads and fabric with which to make her garments.  Her goal is to have a larger workshop, and to be able to teach this lovely art form to more women in her locality.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva

tiene 63 a\u00f1os, vive en su casa propia al lado de su hermano, cu\u00f1ada y sobrinos, en un barrio ubicado en la selva central peruana. Es separado y sus 2 hijos son mayores y ya viven independientemente.\n\nDesde muy joven se dedica al cultivo de frutos c\u00edtricos, ya que por esta parte del pa\u00eds es lo que generalmente la tierra produce en grandes cantidades. Trabaja cada d\u00eda y vigila con mucha dedicaci\u00f3n sus plantas, a veces cuando la siembra es baja trabaja solo y cuando la producci\u00f3n se proyecta a crecer contrata peones para que lo ayuden en la cosecha. A Lorenzo le gusta mucho su trabajo, pues es tranquilo y lo mantiene entretenido en busca del progreso. Aunque no tiene a quien mantener, se esmera mucho para salir adelante y obtiene muy buenas ganancias por la venta de sus c\u00edtricos. Para m\u00e1s adelante tiene planeado sembrar en mayor cantidad y empezar a sembrar pl\u00e1tanos para variar su producci\u00f3n. \n\nEste es el cuarto pr\u00e9stamo que tiene con MFP y est\u00e1 muy agradecido con todas las personas que hicieron posible el cr\u00e9dito que le permitir\u00e1 continuar trabajando.

","en":"Lorenzo is 63 years old and lives in his own home that is near his brother, sister-in-law, and nieces and nephews.  He resides in a neighborhood located in the central Peruvian jungle.  Lorenzo is separated from his wife and has two adult children who live independently.  \r\n<p>\r\nHe has been growing citrus fruits since he was a young man.  This part of the country is generally responsible for growing produce in large quantities.  Lorenzo works each day and looks after his crops with great dedication.  He sometimes works alone when the work is slow, but when the harvest season arrives, he hires laborers to help with the work.  Lorenzo enjoys what he does because the work is peaceful and keeps him entertained as he looks to make progress.  Although he does not have anyone else to maintain his farm, he goes to great lengths to get ahead and generate a good income from the sale of his citrus fruits.  In the future, he plans to plant a wider variety of crops by introducing bananas to vary his production.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is his fourth loan with MFP.  Lorenzo is extremely grateful to everyone who made this loan possible so that he can continue working.

She lives at the school and wants to expand her small business with the purchase of chairs and tables for her snack bar. This is why she would like the loan. Her greatest wish is to be able to give her children a house of their own in order to grow and live better. The rest of the group works at selling fruit, soft drinks, flowers, drinks and providing public transportation of passengers as an owner of one's own vehicles or as chauffeurs and another of the members works at renting table football tables. All the group members have a lot of experience in their work so competence is not a factor that prevents them from generating income. The loan will be put toward the purchase of merchandise, vehicle repair, payment of debts and for the purchase and refurbishment of table football tables. The group is in their first cycle but already has experience with solidarity groups, which is why they know how to administer their funds and be a responsible group with their commitments.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Tara Binetti, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1950,"image":{"id":525787,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"Capital for operations","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-17 -65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":73,"posted_date":"2010-04-19T04:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1950,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Veronica  Beatriz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Javier","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alberto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Susana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Veronica Lucia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Leonarda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hugo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Monica Heidi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Natividad  Eugenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Omar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":13500,"loan_amount":1950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1619.78},{"due_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1638.68},{"due_date":"2010-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1657.8},{"due_date":"2010-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1677.11},{"due_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1696.69},{"due_date":"2010-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1716.53},{"due_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1736.51},{"due_date":"2010-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1756.9}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":233.97},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":236.7},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":239.46},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":242.25},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":245.07},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":247.95},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250.83},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":253.77}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":710.13,"local_amount":4916.26,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-12T08:09:44Z","rounded_local_amount":4961.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136673461,"comment":null},{"amount":142.98,"local_amount":989.83,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-12T08:10:31Z","rounded_local_amount":998.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144707578,"comment":null},{"amount":592.29,"local_amount":4100.5,"processed_date":"2010-06-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-12T08:10:44Z","rounded_local_amount":4137.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151891051,"comment":null},{"amount":250.83,"local_amount":1736.51,"processed_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-12T08:11:06Z","rounded_local_amount":1752.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151891052,"comment":null},{"amount":253.77,"local_amount":1756.9,"processed_date":"2010-07-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-02T08:35:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1772.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159631397,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-04-19T19:15:34Z","paid_date":"2010-09-02T08:35:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":193848,"name":"Angelina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Angelina E.

This bank is characterized as being very united and happy.\r\n\r\nMaria del Carmen is a single mother.  She has two vehicles (mini-buses) used for public transportation.  Drivers work with the vehicles, and they give her daily rent.  She lives in a small house that she has owned for 20 years.  \r\n\r\nShe needs the loan for upkeep of her vehicles.  She will buy some replacement parts.  If her vehicles stop working because they need mechanical help, she does not get the rent money that day.  As she does not have other income, she wants to make the repairs as quickly as possible.  Her biggest hope is to be able to expand her house in order to make her son, a student, more comfortable.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the group is involved in different activities like selling clothes, making and selling comforters, selling cosmetics by catalog, making and selling jackets, or public passenger transportation.  Generally, the group has plenty of experience in the businesses the have.  That is the reason they are well known in the fairs where they sell their products, and the competition in the market is not important.\r\n\r\nThe loan is to buy merchandise, repair their vehicles, and to buy raw material to make comforters and the rest of the products.

Most of the men work in the area of construction or urban transportation with their own taxis.  Other activities the members do are selling food, catalog sales, or selling CDs.  \r\n\r\nIt is important to mention that a large part of the members of the group have been selling in the same place for years, and they are neighbors.  The group has plenty of experience in the activities they do.\r\n\r\nThe loan is to be used as working capital to buy raw materials and utensils for their businesses.  It will also be used to solve some problems that keep them from fully doing their jobs in their businesses (buy tires for vehicles, and some vehicle repairs).\r\n\r\nThe bank is new and in its first cycle, but many of the members have experience with communal loan.  They are able to qualify as trustworthy people thanks to the member evaluation that was completed at the previous meetings. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

She hopes to be very successful, now that she has started her new business.  This is a fulfillment of one of her dreams, and thanks to the institution, it has become reality.  In the future we can take a picture of her in her new business.\r\n\r\nShe is very happy to have a loan from Kiva.  She is hardworking and for many years has made cakes and pies.  Her daughters help her in their free time from studying in the university.  Another hope for Mrs Yoselin is to see her daughters become professionals.

Eduardo is married and is the father of four children. His oldest daughter attends secondary school and the three younger children are in primary school with the earnings this business generates to cover some family expenses. Eduardo told us that because of this business, he was able to buy the house in which he lives. When he began to work, he was barely 14 years old, and at 21 years old he opened his own carpentry shop, and with the savings he bought machinery. When the clients he had earlier realized that he had his own workshop, they began seeking him out to do jobs, and so it was that he started his Furniture Factory. Eduardo has two employees who help him produce furniture that he sells to his clients. His clientele has increased and he sees a need for borrowing money to buy wood, the most important material for his business. His wish is to have a factory with modern technology for serial products and thereby acquire new national and international clients, fostering more employment, and bettering the living conditions for himself and his family.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jo Longnecker, Kiva

They are involved in a variety of commercial activities, such as: clothing and cosmetics sales, vegetable sales, manufacture and sale of sportswear and jacket sales.  In their last cycle they all paid back in full except one of the members who used her savings to repay because one of her family members became ill; her membership in the communal bank was revoked.\r\n\r\nAng\u00e9lica is the group representative and is the current bank president.  She sells various brands of catalogue cosmetics.  She has been in this line of work for 5 years and will use the requested funds to take advantage of sales and promotions that the firm offering the cosmetics has available.\r\n\r\nShe has been separated from her husband for about 20 years; she lives with her oldest children and her grandchildren.  Ang\u00e9lica acts as both mother and father watching over the wellbeing of the entire family.  Because she has limited resources, funds from the institution have been of great use to her to get ahead together with her family and children.  She has stood out in her communal bank as a responsible and punctual person with respect to her repayments; she is also very cheerful.\r\n\r\nElisa is a new group member.  She is 18 years old and has a 10 month old baby but this is not an obstacle for her to improve and to continue forward despite everything.  She is unmarried and lives with her mother and sisters.  She is both mother and father to her son.  Because he is in a development stage she needs more resources for his nourishment and clothing.  For this reason, she has to work.\r\n\r\nShe and her family live in a two-room house; they are a low-income family.  The funds will be used to buy merchandise in order to open a neighborhood grocery store since she already has a proper locale for it located two blocks from Minibus Route 300 stop in VilL. Victoria.    This will make it possible for her to support her family and her son.\r\n\r\nShe is bank treasurer and she was elected to this post thanks to the responsibility and companionship she has shown during her training period.\r\n\r\nRoxana is a returning member; she dropped out for a cycle.  She makes sportswear that she subsequently sells at her sales stand on Illampu Street, an area that is very commercial for sales.  She will use the funds to buy raw materials.\r\n\r\nRoxana is single and has a daughter; she lives with relatives in the Pampahasi area.  Her goal is to own her own house and later on have her own micro business and to sell her items at wholesale; she would even like to export the labor she does indicating that people have to continue forward despite everything, both good and bad.\r\n\r\nShe is very grateful to Emprender and to Kiva for the trust placed by granting the loan.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by

Her husband is a teacher and they have a good familial relationship.\r\n\r\nOur member sells beauty products  but not in a store.  The brands that she sells are Yanbal and Esika.  She has only recently started handling Esika and she is seeing how this cosmetic line works out. She has been in this business for eight years and she does it to help with the financial support of her family and also because she likes sales.\r\n\r\nWith the loan she has received from the foundation she has been able to grow her capital.  With this new loan she will buy perfumes, makeup, creams and costume jewelry. She has to pay for the products every 15 days and that is why she decided to purchase the merchandise with cash.

Just a few days ago, he began planting a crop of corn. \r\n<p>\r\nJulio is excited and quite happy with the work he is doing.  He wants to make sure that he has a good production, so he decided to acquire fertilizers and pesticides to apply to his crop of corn so that it develops properly.

for the last 5 months; she is married and has three children (two adults and one 14-year-old).\r\n\r\nShe started out selling clothing door-to-door and via prior orders 10 years ago.  Because this didn\u2019t produce sufficient income she decided to open a second business:  sale of home-maD. tamales.  She has been in this second line of work for 4 years and, as her income increased, she decided to invest more into it.  Thanks to an invitation to join the bank extended by some of her neighbors, she obtained her first loan which she used to buy ingredients for the tamales: corn, banana leaves, chicken, etc.\r\n\r\nHer current loan will be used to buy an industrial stove and, of course, more ingredients for tamale preparation.\r\n\r\nThe goal she has in mind now and has had for a long time now and that she continues to strive for is to have an electric juicer and to open a juice bar in an area with lots of foot traffic.\r\n\r\nHer greatest wish is to continue to support her youngest son\u2019s secondary and

featured entrepreneur is an active Barangay official from Silangit, Tangub City. Mrs.Osita R. is a Barangay Councilor, 53 years of age, married and blessed with 4 children, 2 young adults and 2 teenagers. Her husband earns an income as a \u201cjabal-jabal\u201d (single motor vehicle for hire) driver. Although he earns an average income of 150 PHP a day, it is not enough to support the family and that is why Mrs. R. undoubtedly engaged in business. She opened up a little sari-sari store and for 2 years she has been able to sustain her business. She is now earning an average net income of 1,500 PHP a month. With good luck, she was also elected as a Barangay Councilor and earns an average honorarium of 3,000 PHP a month, which is so helpful. \r\n\r\n<p>With her good reputation in Barangay and her good credit repayment record, Mrs. R. was given the privilege to obtain a first loan of 5,000 PHP. She is now applying for a loan in the amount of 20,000 PHP to add to her capital for her sari-sari store. The future income from this loan will be used to meet the family's daily needs, for loan repayment and for savings. Mrs. R. is hoping that someday her children will finish their studies right up to college, for their good future.\r\n\r\n<p>About PMPC: Paglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model. \r\n\r\n<p>*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

They have 3 adult children who are between 16-26 years old.\r\n\r\nThelma has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 1998 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts.

This will be her 16th cycle loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 25,000 PHP, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom.

C. is a 65-year-old married woman who supports her family by engaging in a general store, cafeteria and fishing business. She lives in Barangay Catali, Kabankalan City, Negros Occidental with her husband, Loreto, who is 69 years old and helps her in running her business.  They have 12 adult children who are between 22-44 years old and raising their own families.\r\n\r\nShe has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 1998 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her general store, cafeteria and fishing business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of $480.\r\n\r\nAdelfa is now borrowing 18,500 PHP so that she can expand her general store, cafeteria and fishing business. This will be her 16th cycle loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 19,500 PHP, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom. Adelfa aspires to elevate her family\u2019s living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the \u201cDungganon\u201d way.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

G. is from the village of Medina, Misamis Oriental. She is 36 years old. Jonah is married and has a school-aged child. To make a living, Jonah runs a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. The main source of income for the business comes from selling both food and daily-use products, such as mineral water, snack foods, soy sauce and vinegar, in the local community. Jonah has been engaged in her business for years and earns approximately 4,000 Philippine pesos a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Jonah joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Jonah has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from HSPFI, a Kiva partner. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell.\r\n\r\nJonah is requesting a new loan of 11,000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be the third loan taken out by Jonah from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the income of her family. \r\n\r\n<b>About HSPFI:<\/b>\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":526046,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

B. is a 41-year-old married woman who lives in Prk Banaba, Brgy Tabugon, Kabankalan City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by selling food and herbal products.\r\n\r\nWilma\u2019s 45-year-old husband, Ronnie, is a farmer. They have 10 children who are between 5 and 22 years old. Four of the children are currently going to school and also help their parents in the business as part of their daily chores. The other six children work to help the family.\r\n\r\nWilma joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 with the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve the quality of their family's life. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD, she has been able to increase their family income by selling food and herbal products. Now she earns an average monthly income of PHP 4,000 from her business activities.\r\n\r\nWilma is a member in good standing. Her previous loan of PHP 17,000 was used to fund operations of her business, and it had a positive impact on both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is borrowing for her twentieth cycle loan, PHP 15,000, which she intends to use for her business of selling food and herbal products. Wilma is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which are to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":525255,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She is a parent member, married and mother to eight children. She is active in trading and selling vegetables and charcoal. She is requesting a loan of 500,000 francs which will be used for the purchase of charcoal destined to be resold. For some time she has noticed an increase in demand, and her aim is to satisfy the orders of shop owners who are increasingly asking for this product.
