They like their town because it is quiet and safe. There is never any violence or other negative things happening. Even though they know each other well, there is never time to chat to each other. This is because these women are overwhelmed with the household chores such as preparing meals for the entire family, washing clothes, working, etc. For that reason, these women are very happy with the repayment meetings and the informal education training Friendship Bridge offers to all the clients. \r\n\r\nThe members of the group work in various businesses such as raising animals, administering a small restaurant, administering a beauty salon, administering a school for hair stylists, and selling fruit at the market of Solol\u00e1. Hilaria invited her daughter and niece to the group. These two young and modern women sell jewelry to acquaintances in Solol\u00e1. They are able to take care of their expenses while attending school with the revenue from their business. This aspect of their work is very encouraging. This means that, through microfinance, a woman can pay her expenses throughout school without relying on anybody else. \r\n\r\nFaustina, the group leader, tells me she raises small pigs until they are big, and then they are sold to an intermediary who always buys the pigs from her and her sisters, who are members of another trust bank.\r\n\r\nAnother group member, Aura, who is 8 months pregnant, wants to invest her credit in buying an extra chair for her beauty salon. This way she can teach more people how to cut hair. She tells me with a smile how more young people cut and style their hair than before. In the past, women grew their hair since they were young. Cutting their hair wasn\u2019t the fashion then. Instead, they just trimmed it a couple of inches. \r\n\r\nThe women formed the group after they had a visit from one of the loan officers called Catarina. They hope to be able maintain this pleasant path of improving their lives. Because some of them only went to school when they were kids, they would really like to be able to provide their own children a better future through education."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2850,"image":{"id":193225,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Invest in

They live in traditional polygamist families in the Sogomougou neighborhood in the city of Koutiala (third economic region of Mali). They run different businesses, notably in the sale of construction wood, food-service (exclusively at night), etc. United by profession, neighborhood, and age, in trying to grow their businesses, the group members decided to use microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso\u2019s credit program, which they have been doing for two years. They are on their third group loan, and their first two were repaid without difficulty. The current loan will be used to buy a truckload of construction wood, a bag of beans, boxes of macaroni, and a large quantity of ingredients for their food-service business. They stock up in Koutiala\u2019s neighboring villages from forest farmers for the construction wood and at the city\u2019s big market for the ingredients for the nocturnal food-service.

She lives in a monogamous family in the Pelengana Nord neighborhood in the city of S\u00e9gou (fourth economic region of Mali). After having attempted several business for years with her adoptive mother, she decided 5 years ago to specialize in buying and selling leather shoes, women\u2019s handbags, and loaves of bread. In order to secure additional resources, she decided to turn to microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso\u2019s credit program (3 years ago) to be able to better satisfy the needs of her growing clientele. After having secured three group loans with an association in her neighborhood, she is now on her second individual loan. All of the preceding loans were properly repaid. She plans to use this loan to buy 1,000 loaves of bread, 40 handbags, and 40 pairs of shoes. She gets her handbags and shoes from Bamako (capital of the Republic of Mali) from artisans specializing in leather goods. She gets her bread from a bakery with which she has signed an exclusivity agreement. The bags and shoes are sold at home and at the big market in the city of S\u00e9gou (for cash or credit, traveling or on the spot) usually on Mondays, the market days (when sellers sell the most). Taking care of the special setup to sell bread, she sells her goods to men and women (principally villagers) who come to stock up in order to resell in their respective villages. She hopes to earn 30,000 CFA francs monthly, which will be used towards making loan payments and contributing to her family\u2019s expenses \u2013 the rest will be invested in her business.

They do their buying of raw material (white bazins, potash and dyes) in Bamako and in S\u00e9gou. They dye their fabric in their workshop.

Alejandra wants her children to get ahead so that they can have a better future and better professional opportunities. She began in January of 2003, first selling ceramics. That didn't go well, so Alejandra finished off the merchandise. This year she began to sell clothing in the nearby markets and her business has taken off.

On average they are 37 years old and have 5 children.  They live in polygamous families with their husbands, co-spouses and other relatives.  They lead various business activities: Conversion, purchase and sale of crops, charcoal and food products, wool knitting, pottery, etc.  Concerned with increasing the size of their business, the members of the Kotognongontala group incorporated a loan program through the Soro Yiriwaso microfinance institution for the last eight years.  The group is requesting its seventh loan after having correctly repaid all previous loans.  The current loan will be used to buy 3 dozen plastic cups, 2 dozen pairs of plastic shoes, 7 reels of wool thread (to make baby clothes) at the large market in the city of Sikasso, 60 bags of charcoal and 250kg of \u201cn\u00e9r\u00e9\u201d tree seeds (to make \u201csoumbala,\u201d a condiment) locally or in surrounding villages.  The products are sold at the large city market in Sikasso on market days and in the village of Kaboila as retail, wholesale and cash sales.

pensioner's salary does not go very far for Suparmi and her retired army veteran husband. As a result, Suparmi works hard to help her husband in fulfilling the family needs. She has opened a stall that sells fried foods such as fried banana, fried tofu, fried yam and other such items. This stall serves the locals who work nearby as fishermen. In a day usually Suparmi needs about Rp.50.000-Rp.70.000 (approx. US$5-$7) in working capital and her net earnings total about Rp.30.000-Rp.40.000 (approx. US$3-$4). This business helps Suparmi sufficiently meet the needs of her family as well as care for her grandchild, who is under five years of age at this time. From the funds granted by DINARI foundation, Suparmi has big hopes of expanding her business and also fixing her house which is very simple at the moment.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Aarati, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSebagai istri dari seorang pensiunan tentara dengan gaji yang tidak seberapa membuat Suparmi ikut bekerja keras membantu suaminya dalam memenuhi kebutuhan keluarganya yaitu dengan membuka usaha warung yang menjual gorengan seperti pisang goreng, tahu goreng, ketela goreng dan lain-lainnya. Warungnya ini melayani  warga disekitarnya  yang  bekerja sebagai nelayan. Dalam sehari biasanya Suparmi memerlukan modal Rp 50.000,- sampai dengan Rp 75.000,- dan keuntungan yang bisa diperolehnya sekitar Rp.30.000,- sampai Rp 40.000,-. Dari usahanya ini Suparmi bisa mencukupi kebutuhan keluarganya juga termasuk untuk membesarkan cucunya yang masih balita yang ikut diasuhnya sampai saat ini.

M. lives in Vakhdat. Abdullo is 68 years old and is married with 3 children. He has been working in retail for the past twenty years. Abdullo owns a food store, which is located next to his house. As Abdullo's store is located in a remote village. As Abdullo's store gives people an opportunity to buy food without leaving the village, there is high demand for the food he sells. The prices in his store are fair and even low.  Abdullo wants to increase his store's assortment, and in order to be able to do so, he would like to build new shelves.

Married and responsible for four people, she is a dynamic and very dedicated woman, with a sense of entrepreneurship.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, she contends with poor purchasing power, which prevents her from meeting the high customer demand. Consequently, she does not clear sufficient profit to permit her to meet her various household\u2019s expenses. \r\nIn order to maximize profits and improve her household\u2019s standard of living,

She lives in the 3rd district of S\u00e9gou (fourth economic region of the Republic of Mali) with her husband and child. At a young age. she tried herself out at several businesses but without success. She ended up approaching and learning from her grandmother (who is a famous traditional science specialist) to learn the production of Gongonlili and incense, traditional aphrodisiac products. After completing her training, she continued to work in this area concerning secret knowledge. Today, Mrs. Kadiatou C. enjoys a great reputation in her region. She receives orders from all areas of West Africa (Mali, Burkina and Ivory Coast). To produce these aphrodisiac products, a new water bottle needs to be filled with clean water that is poured on the gongonlili (exotic plant in West Africa believed to have aphrodisiac and medical properties). She then shapes the completely soaked gongonlili into a circular or oval form after having attached it to a white wire. This plant is then boiled in hot water and the liquid concoction is then consumed.  She decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso microfinance institution 3 years ago in order to satisfy the needs of her growing clientele. After 4 group loans, this is her second individual loan, with all preceding loans refunded in full. With this loan, she intends to buy: 50 bags of gongonlili, 20 kg of incense, 2 boxes of perfume, 2 rolls of local wire and empty mayonnaise jars. She gets her raw materials primarily from Bamako (capital of the Republic of Mali) and San (S\u00e9gou region). Very well known in this science, she generates enormous cash sales, often in wholesale, with various customers. She hopes to generate a profit of 200.000 FCFA and passionately dreams of building a house.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ivana Kostic, Kiva

Sales have been good.  This enables us to collect some profit, allowing us to make our payments on time, per the loan contract, and even to make them ahead of time.

region. He was born in 1970 in the Taknazari kishlak in the Faizabad region. He is married and has 4 children. Although he is the head of the family, his salary is not enough to provide for his family.

The small retirement pension which he receives irregularly does not allow him to meet the needs of his wives and his 20 dependents.\r\n\r\n<p>In response to this, he bought a grain mill, which serves to supplement his income. In order to generate the most possible profit from the mill, he would like to stock up on gas oil fuel [to operate the mill] during periods of surplus, so that he can use it in times of shortage.

However, due to multiple years of drought as well as the effects of desertification, the circle of poverty has greatly increased and has thrown this population into precarious conditions. With the renewal of this loan, the goal will be to create new financial resources for community members who develop small inter-village businesses selling local products. The strategy rests upon the ability of the group to purchase and stock enough raw materials to create a working capital and to satisfy the demand of the weekly markets in the neighbouring rural communities.  They will have to purchase raw materials when the price is very low, stock the materials, then organise the redistribution of these materials throughout the year.

born on March 21st, 1969. After divorcing her husband, she was left with two children. She decided to become an entrepreneur to support her family. Since she had already worked in the regional Consumer's Association, she had experience in sales. She rented a booth in the central market in the town of Vahdat to sell perfume. Gaining experience as an entrepreneur, Guljamol used the money she earned to expand her line of products.

(The picture shows Mrs. Ros T. and her husband.)\r\n<p>\r\nOn their plantation, Mrs. T. faces a small problem because she does not have enough animals to plow her rice field. So she is requesting a loan to buy a second ox to plow the rice field so she can cultivate rice. Previously, Mrs. Ros T. had a loan to buy rice seeds and she has fully paid it back.

four dependent children. In his town of Vahdat there are many pool clubs which are often visited by young people and pool lovers. Djamshed also loves pool and started working as a watch guard in one of the local pool clubs. By working in this club he has realized that he likes this type of business and decided to start his own. He has remodeled part of his house for a pool club and he now has regular clients. In the future he wants to buy more pool and ping pong tables. But at this time Djamshed wants to get a loan of USD$1,200 (4100 somoni) with the help of Kiva to do repairs in his club.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Elena Fedorchuk, Kiva

She has her own business, which she began 5 years ago. She started it with sales of video cassettes and re-recording services. Now she sells video cassettes, video CDs, and DVDs in a store in Vahdat. Her products include the films and songs most in demand. Kenjabi's regular customers are happy with the range of goods she carries. She has one employee in addition to herself. A relative helps her and receives a bonus for disk sales. She brings the goods in from the Sadvarg Shopping Center. Beside disk sales, Kenjabi also provides xeroxing services.\r\n<p>\r\nWith the help of KIVA, Kenjabi would like to receive a loan of 4100 somoni ($1200) in order to increase her sales turnover. <br

children. He is a specialist in radio and television equipment repair. He began working in 1980 as an apprentice. As he gradually amassed experience in this area, Nasrullo  began to independently accept contracts and to repair radio receiver sets. Today he is known across the district as a master of his trade. Any client who comes to him with equipment to be fixed leaves with a smile on his face. To provide his services Nasrullo travels to the city Dushanbe to buy spare parts and accessories for audio and video equipment from the company Goluboy Ekran, LLC. \r\n<p>\r\nNasrullo dreams of expending his buisness, building a private shop and mentoring apprentices. When he found out about Kiva he decided to take part and take out a loan of 4100 somoni ($1200) to bring his dreams into reality. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Anna Brown, Kiva

She is married and has three children. For 11 years, she has worked as an operator for the \u201cTojiktelecom\u201d company in Vakhdat city. She works from morning to night for a small salary which she uses to feed her family. Her husband takes on odd-jobs also bringing home a small salary. She would like to do small repairs on her home, to paint the walls and fix the roof in preparation for the upcoming winter. Knowing that she could get a loan to repair her home and gradually pay it back over 10 months, Sabohat decided to participate in Kiva's loan program. She would like to take a loan of 1500 somoni for a 10 month period.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Josh Machleder, Kiva

They have five children on average and generally live in polygamous households with their parents-in-law, siblings, co-spouses, and children in the Ouayerma II district in the city of Sikasso (the third most economic region in the Republic of Mali).\r\nThey generally have businesses that specialize in condiments, general food products, outfits and various other items.\r\nIn order to satisfy the demand of the clientele, which is constantly growing, they decided together to work with the microfinance institution called Soro Yiriwaso, which has allowed them to already take out four group loans, all paid back successfully.\r\nThey plan to purchase 50 kilograms of fabrics, which they will use to make curtains, 10 baskets of condiments, 100 egg crates, and 100 full outfits in Sikasso and possibly in Bamako, the capital of Mali, and the Republic of Burkina Faso.  \r\nTheir products are sold at the market in the city of Sikasso, spread out under sheds, in their households, or in the street.  They sell both wholesale and retail and mostly in cash.\r\nThey hope to earn a 2,500 FCFA monthly profit, which will go towards the interest on the loan, help with the needs of their families, and the rest will be invested in their businesses. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Lucia Franzese, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":194534,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchase condiments, eggs, fabrics and children\u2019s outfits","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2008-09-06T02:20:33Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mamou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Assetou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rokia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sitan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-20T15:32:34Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2008-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2008-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":191.67},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":191.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":191.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":191.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":191.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":191.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":192,"local_amount":83478.26,"processed_date":"2008-10-20T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-21T07:18:48Z","rounded_local_amount":85188.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":366883,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":191.33,"local_amount":83188.4,"processed_date":"2008-11-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T02:43:14Z","rounded_local_amount":84893.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5350913,"comment":null},{"amount":191.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2008-12-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:34:53Z","rounded_local_amount":85040.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9973976,"comment":null},{"amount":191.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-01-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:29:08Z","rounded_local_amount":85040.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14889349,"comment":null},{"amount":191.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:14:18Z","rounded_local_amount":85040.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20440142,"comment":null},{"amount":191.66,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2009-03-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:10:31Z","rounded_local_amount":85041,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135511,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-09-06T15:32:34Z","paid_date":"2009-04-15T22:10:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":62091,"name":"Ang\u00e9lica","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Ang\u00e9lica B. is unmarried and owns a small grocery store.

Atitlan is known around the lake for the strong presence of the Mayan Tzutujil people. \r\n\r\nDespite this interesting background and beautiful scenery, the women from the group tell me this town can be dangerous at times. This is especially true for women, who are already greatly under pressure to keep their families running, and sometimes deal with attacks and suffer from the hard laws of the street. The troubled times caused by the Civil War during the eighties have influenced Santiago's contemporary reality very much; this is why Conception, who does most of the talking for the group, thinks that life in Santiago is, even today, a difficult one.\r\n \r\nPride and the continuing search for a better life keeps the women of this group going and they are working hard to improve their lives and the lives of the ones they love.\r\n\r\nMost of the women work in embroidery. The Santiago Atitlan embroidery is delightful. Artisans will weave beautiful birds and Mayan symbols in their typical blouses called Guipiles.  For almost all of the women this is their second, third or fourth loan. There are even some women who came from another group and have managed to establish their lives quite well after 8 years of microfinance loans, says Josefa, who is one of them herself. Josefa is the president of the group. While working in her convenience shop that she has managed to build, she works on embroidery too. She is also very happy to be able to help the younger members of the group to learn how to invest their credit well. \r\n\r\nConception says that it is everybody's wish to take advantage of every opportunity they have to talk to foreigners. This is because talking to foreigners is an opportunity for them to show their beautiful art to the world and this can become an opportunity to sell or even export their goods to other countries. Selling their products to foreigners will generate the earnings they deserve, especially during the tough rainy season when the prices of their weavings drop dramatically and the competition increases. This is because there is too much competition in the local market and their weavings are sold at very low prices. This means they sometimes have to sell their products under production costs just to get some money for future investments. The rest of the group very much agreed with her and gave Conception a round of applause because she has expressed herself well."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3300,"image":{"id":194598,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","use":"Invest in

While climbing up the steep hill, I recalled the information I had read about Mayan culture and urbanization. This town was built utilizing the old traditional Mayan ways. This is because the view from the town to the lake and further to the volcanoes gives it really a magical feel.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I was introduced to the women of the group they woke me up from my dreamy thoughts about Santiago de Atitlan. They exposed how hard it is to live in a town which is overwhelmed by poverty, which in this case was reflected in crime and drug abuse. The 30-year-old civil war has also left a big swath of painful memories, they tell me. Despite all this, the women are very proud of their skilful art and the culture they have managed to protect, says Dolores.\r\n\r\nMost of the women are weavers. They weave the typical Santiago de Atitlan guipiles and pantalones: beautiful typical blouses known throughout the country for their handsome embroidery. Artisans will embroider beautiful birds and Mayan symbols. Five of the women work in the art of making jewellery as does Maria, the president. Elena sells fish she imports from the Pacific coast area. And the two other women sell clothes from a little stall in town.\r\n\r\nBeing part of the trust bank brings the women a lot of enjoyment. Maria tells me that the lessons they had 2 years ago about medicines and family planning were very helpful. They like to get together to talk about their lives. The elder women with years of experience help the younger women to set up a business. They are a close group who have been together for over 5 years!  Being able to export their goods is a big dream for some of them. This way they should be able to get a fair price for their goods to keep their families running. \r\n\r\nSome of the women desire to send their children to school in the city because there are more chances for a better education and a more promising future. I leave the group with great admiration of their calm but deeply-held views on life and feel they really deserve to have all the successes they dream might come to them.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3225,"image":{"id":194606,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","use":"invest
