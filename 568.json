is a 35-year-old single woman who lives in Kupang.

In 2006, she was entrusted with managing a beauty salon owned by her aunt, and did so until the beginning of 2009. From there, Ruth wanted to open her own business and so she did, with her little savings. \r\n \r\nShe experienced ups and downs while running her business. Lack of equipment and availability of employees to assist her in running the business have become her greatest challenges. She realizes that the income generated from the business depends on the number of customers she has. \r\n\r\nRuth really wants to improve her business to satisfy her customers. In order to do so, she is requesting a loan of 4,000,000 IDR from TLM to buy additional equipment such as a hair flatiron for her salon. She is hoping that her loan application will be approved.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":167.82,"image":{"id":737129,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty

She is 65 years old. Flora\u2019s mother\u2019s died when she was two years old, and she was brought up by a stepmother. After finishing nine years of secondary school, Flora  started working as a farmer, growing onions at the communal farm of the Kara-Tule Village. Two years later, she married Platon, a mA. from her village. Due to shortage of irrigation water in UzbekistA., Flora together with her husband and three young children moved to KyrgyzstA., to the village of Krasnaya Rechka. \r\n\r\nThings were going well at their new home. Flora and Platon took a lease out on a land plot and grew onions, tomatoes, melons etc. After three years of hard work, they managed to put enough money aside to buy their own house. In 1992, Flora and her husband had the idea of  going to Russia as migrant workers, but they weren\u2019t able to earn much. After a lot of trials and lack of permanent living quarters, they returned   to KyrgystA.. Here again they leased land and continued to do the work they are used to\u2014farming. Since Flora and her husband started working early and did not have a chance to continue their education, they did everything in their power to enable their two daughters and son to receive good university education. In 2005, having first heard of the Bai-Tushum and Partners organization, Flora requested her first loA.. She has been collaborating with this company for over six years. Every spring, in preparation for irrigation works, she requests credit to purchase seeds, fertilizers and fuel. In addition, she raises livestock. She keeps a cow and plans to have 3 cows in total in the future. Flora plans to take out a loA. in the amount of 60,000 KGS to purchase seeds and fertilizers for planting and preparing her soil. \r\n\r\nAbout two years ago Flora lost her son, who died from cancer, but her daughters and grandchildren became her  source of support and help. Flora cA.\u2019t remain idle and does all she cA. in order to help  offer her family a good and dignified   life. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1275,"image":{"id":737161,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase fertilizers and seeds ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Krasnaya Rechka village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:25Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Flora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-02-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":60000,"loan_amount":1275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":60000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1275}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1275,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:23:59Z","rounded_local_amount":60484.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244514623,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-04-02T17:27:08Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T09:23:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":284587,"name":"Esther","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Esther L. is from the village of Villa Verde, Iligan City.

She is married and lives with her husband, son, daughter-in-law, and two grandsons.\r\n\r\nKandalat was born in 1953 into a large and simple farm family. From an early age, she was an independent child who helped her mother with the house. In 1972 after leaving school, Kandalat entered the national university to study biology. In 1977, she graduated, returned to the city of Osh, and  got a job teaching biology in high school. She had two children and continued to work at school while her husband worked in agriculture. \r\n\r\nIn 1982 Kandalat became the principal of the school, and she worked there until 2008. Because of the low salary, in 2008 Kandalat decided to quit and she and her family moved from Osh to the village of Novonikolaevka (in the Chuysky region in Kyrgyzstan). They bought a house and a three-hectare plot of land to grow fruit and vegetables.\r\n\r\nAt present, thanks to Kandalat\u2019s persistence and diligence, their holdings include one milk cow, three calves, and one bull.

is a 31-year-old single man from Baalback.  He owns a shop where he sells Hookah (also known as a waterpipe) which is a single or multi-stemmed (often glass-based) instrument for smoking in which the smoke is cooled and filtered by passing through water. The tobacco smoked is referred to as narghile or shisha (sheesha) in the United Kingdom, United States and Canada. \n\nOriginally from India, Hookah has gained popularity, especially in the Middle East, and is gaining popularity in North America, South America, Europe and Australia since 2001. Imad's business is expanding since the Hookah is expanding a lot in the region. Most of Imad's clients are friends, neighbors, relatives and some passing by. \n\nIn addition to Hookah users, there are cafe owners who change their Hookahs continuously. Imad is requesting a loan from Al Majmoua for the second time, in order to increase his Hooka's inventory and to buy necessary household appliances. His previous loan was very efficient and it affected him positively, both socially and economically. He hopes to expand his business through starting a wholesale trade in the future.

As a result, she decided to start her own business, taking advantage of the opportunities offered by each commercial season.\r\n\r\nYenis started out with some capital that she acquired from informal lenders at a high cost.  She managed to pay this money back but she lost out on making better net profits and missed opportunities to invest in her business.  Through disciplined and persistent work, however, Yenis now has a very small amount of working capital that she would like to increase through this loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She is applying for a Kiva loan so that she can invest in buying school supplies because they are the merchandise that sells at this time of year and they will represent a good product turnover and a quick profit.\r\n\r\nYenis is very satisfied with her business because it has enabled her to make income to cover the basic needs of her family.  Her family consists of herself and her three children who are currently aged between 17 and 23.  Yenis' dream and greatest challenge is to increase her income so that she can respond to the expenses that come from improving her children's living conditions, adapting her home and providing her children with a good-quality education.  She also hopes to grow her business which has been affected by the fact that, up until now, she has worked solely with the personal capital that she has managed to make from her own

She has been extracting seafood from the ocean for some 12 years now.  Her children assist her; they are in charge of diving for the products of the sea.  Her schedule is flexible, since she only sells what is extracted, and replenishes equipment; specifically, diving suits, hoses, and nets to extract the product.\r\n\r\nAt present, Adriana lacks a boat, due to the earthquake of February 27th, 2010, which completely destroyed hers.  Now, her children lease a boat with a motor-compressor, since it is very expensive to buy one.  With this loan, she will purchase diving hoses and 2 pairs of flippers.\r\n\r\nAdriana's dream is for her business to grow and to be able to invest in it in an independent manner.

The region is in the south of Chile.  It has been important in Chile's history as the location of many battles and sieges, especially during the Arauco War, due to its location on the frontier of Mapuche territory.  At present, the city is undergoing important economic and demographic development, becoming one of Chile's most relevant urban, administrative, financial and commercial centers, after Santiago and Valparaiso. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":732852,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","use":"TO BUY DIVING HOSES AND TWO PAIRS OF FLIPPERS FOR FISHING","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CL","country":"Chile","town":"Concepci\u00f3n","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-30 -71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":157,"posted_date":"2011-03-24T16:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adriana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CLP","disbursal_amount":258378,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":11242},{"due_date":"2011-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":12269},{"due_date":"2011-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":12348},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12428},{"due_date":"2011-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":12508},{"due_date":"2011-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":12589},{"due_date":"2011-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":12158},{"due_date":"2011-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":13228},{"due_date":"2011-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":12834},{"due_date":"2011-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":12917},{"due_date":"2011-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":13001},{"due_date":"2011-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":13085},{"due_date":"2011-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":13169},{"due_date":"2011-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":13255},{"due_date":"2011-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":13340},{"due_date":"2011-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":13426},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13513},{"due_date":"2011-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":13601},{"due_date":"2011-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":13688},{"due_date":"2011-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":13779}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.93},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.12},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.28},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.46},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.62},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.8},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.88},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.16},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.32},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.49},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.68},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.85},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.03},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.22},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.4},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.58},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.76},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.95},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.14},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":76.33,"local_amount":35859,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:59:43Z","rounded_local_amount":36734.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201282283,"comment":null},{"amount":133.92,"local_amount":62911,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:56:32Z","rounded_local_amount":64447.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206150290,"comment":null},{"amount":110.34,"local_amount":51837,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:11:21Z","rounded_local_amount":53102.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211223373,"comment":null},{"amount":113.23,"local_amount":53190,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:02:54Z","rounded_local_amount":54488.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216502347,"comment":null},{"amount":116.18,"local_amount":54581,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:45:01Z","rounded_local_amount":55913.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221666350,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-03-24T17:30:51Z","paid_date":"2011-08-15T08:45:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":284665,"name":"Antoinette","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Antoinette is 43 years old, married and has seven children who range in age from 6 to 25 years old.

Typically, Nepali households grow crops on small plots of terraced land. Rice (bhat), lentils (daal), and vegetables (thakari) are the staples of the Nepali diet. With a Kiva loan, BPW's borrowers are able to purchase greater amounts of seed and fertilizer.  With more seeds and fertilizer, a borrower is able to grow cash crops to be sold in the local market. Such crops allow households to move beyond subsistence and provide much-needed cash income throughout the year. \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007. Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women. In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.

Esequiel looks after his dad Juan, his mom Doris and his five siblings in their own home which is located in the small village of Bellavista Huaracayo.

His parents rovided him with a plot of land where he started growing peas.\r\n\r\nWhat Esequiel most enjoys about his work is harvest time as that is when he sees all his hard work rewarded.  He also tells us that he grows crops on a small scale.  This means that during coffee harvest season in the jungle, he travels in order to work as a laborer on other people's coffee plantations.  \"I have to work in other places in order to save money\", he says.  Esequiel's greatest wish is to become an important farmer and sow his crops over many hectares of land.  In order to achieve this goal, Esequiel works without rest, waiting patiently for the moment when he can invest with his own capital.\r\n\r\nEsequiel is a member of the \"Se\u00f1or de Muruhuay\" community bank and this is his first loan with MFP.

Their names and occupations are Mar\u00eda Guadalupe (cake store), Josefina (grocery store), Lucia (Mexican snacks), Mar\u00eda de los \u00c1ngeles (snacks), and Cecilia (clothing sales). \r\n\r\nSe\u00f1ora Lucia M. S\u00e1nchez is 34 years old and reached third year of high school. She is married; her husband is a casual labourer and works in Corte de Cebolla. They have four children: Isai (11) in fifth grade, Isaac (9) in fourth grade, No\u00e9 (6) in first grade, and Emanuel (4).\r\n\r\nSra. Lucia is seeking a loan to buy vegetables, napkins, wrapping paper, glasses etc for her food business. Her customers are her neighbours who have their own businesses and tourists looking for somewhere to eat. She serves picaditas, dobladas, rice tacos, and on the weekends pozole, tostadas, tacos dorados, and quesadillas. Lucia started her business a year ago and learned to cook. She had experience in the food industry and decided to open her own business using her savings. It is located in the Rafael Merino neighbourhood, about 10 minutes from her house, so she is able to walk there. It is important as it pays for her children\u2019s educational expenses.\r\n\r\nLucia really enjoys cooking and wishes to learn how to cook more dishes. She is proud that she and her family are getting ahead in life, and proud too that she can save money because of her hard work. One of the challenges she faces is the lack of customers during the rainy season. She is planning to expand her business and wishes to sell fruit salads. She is hoping to do this with the loan money. Lucia is very happy and excited because she is going to be able to do what she planned. She is also planning to make some improvements to her home and have a separate room for her kitchen--it is now part of the bedroom. As for her children, her hope is that they can have a better standard of living and continue with their education.\r\n\r\nThe members of the group wish to thank Kiva and Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad for trusting in them: \u201cWith these loans we are able to fulfill our dreams and make our businesses bigger and better.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1425,"image":{"id":736665,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy vegetables, napkins, wrapping paper, glasses etc","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Col.

She was widowed 2 years ago, and ever since she has been the sole provider for her 2 minor children.  She lives with them in the rural Carita settlement.  She has been farming for 35 years; she started out farming with her husband.  Despite being alone, she continues to work with a lot of effort.  Her main crops are potatoes, peas and corn, and she cultivates these on her own land.  Over all of this time she was able to secure good buyers, as she sells the seeds of the potatoes that she produces to the big wholesale traders.  In addition, she has 3 dairy cows, and she makes cheese that she sells in the market on Sundays.  Now she is getting ready for the harvest of potatoes and corn, and she hopes to get good earnings.  She plans to improve her cultivations so she can have better earnings and this way pay for the education of her children, since she is the only person supporting the family.  She belongs to the communal bank \"Progreso Carita,\" and this is their 7th loan cycle with MFP.  She is grateful for the support that she has received from MFP over the years.

es natural de la ciudad de San Francisco, tiene 35 a\u00f1os de edad, es un joven muy alegre y trabajador, convive con Francisca de 30 a\u00f1os y fruto de su relaci\u00f3n hoy tienen 03 hijos y  juntos viven en su propia casa, situados en la comunidad de Carmen Pampa, caser\u00edo del distrito de San Francisco. Jonny es el pilar de su familia, desde muy ni\u00f1o sus padres le inculcaron a remover la tierra y hoy es todo un conocedor del arduo labor en el agro; es campesino y cuenta con 03 hect\u00e1reas de terreno cultivados con plantas de caf\u00e9, cacao y pl\u00e1tano; plantas oriundas de la zona selv\u00e1tica del Valle R\u00edo Apurimac. Viene removiendo la tierra hace 12 a\u00f1os en su propia parcela, en tiempos de cosecha cuenta con el apoyo de los peones quienes se encargan de cosechar y trasladar los frutos hasta los tendales. Lo que m\u00e1s le gusta de su trabajo es cosechar los frutos de las plantas; ya que as\u00ed siente que los meses de arduo trabajo le brindan como recompensa la calidad de sus frutos. Considera que lo m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil es transportar sus productos desde su comunidad hasta los centros de acopio ubicados en los distritos de Kimbiri y San Francisco; lugares donde le ofrecen mejores precios por sus productos. Su dificultad radica en no poder contar con suficiente ingreso econ\u00f3mico para solventar los pagos por adelantado a los jornaleros quienes le brindan el apoyo en las cosechas y sacar la maleza; es por ello que acude a los cr\u00e9ditos que facilita la Instituci\u00f3n MFP. Pero ahora lo que m\u00e1s prioriza es sembrar m\u00e1s plantas de caf\u00e9 ya que cuenta con 01 hect\u00e1rea de terreno no cultivado. Este es su primer cr\u00e9dito de Jonny con MFP, esta dispuesto cumplir con sus respectivos pagos ya que desea acceder a otro cr\u00e9dito posteriormente. A la vez se siente muy agradecido con la instituci\u00f3n por  concederle el cr\u00e9dito. Con los 3,000 nuevos soles solicitados, contratar\u00e1 jornaleros para que le brinden el apoyo en las cosechas y sacar la maleza.\n\n","en":"Jonny is from the town of San Francisco.  He is 35 years old and a very happy and hard-working young man.  He lives with his partner, 30 year-old Francisca, and they have 3 children together.  They live in their own home which is located in Carmen Pampa, a small village in San Francisco district.\r\n\r\nJonny is the pillar of his family.  His parents taught him to grow crops from a very early age and today he is an expert in the hard slog that is farming.  Jonny is a farmer and he owns 3 hectares of land where he grows coffee, cacao and bananas.  These are all plants which are native to the rainforest area of the Apurimac Valley where he lives.  Jonny has been farming his own plot of land for 12 years.  At harvest times he is helped by laborers who harvest his crops and transport them to drying areas.\r\n\r\nWhat Jonny most enjoys about his work is harvesting his crops since this is when he feels that all his hard work is being rewarded through the quality of his fruit.  He considers that the most difficult part of his work is transporting his products from his community to the warehouses in Kimbiri and San Francisco districts.  This is where they offer him the best prices for his products.  Jonny's problem is that he doesn't have enough money to pay his laborers, who support him in his harvests and in weeding his crops, in advance.  For this reason, he takes loans from MFP.  However, right now his priority is growing more coffee plants since he has 1 hectare of land that is not cultivated.\r\n\r\nThis is Jonny's first loan from MFP.  He is prepared to make his repayments on time since he would like to access further loans in the future.  He is very grateful to the institution for granting him this loan.  Jonny will use the 3,000 Peruvian soles that he has requested to hire laborers to support him in his harvests and in weeding his land."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":737540,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to hire laborers to support him in his harvests and in weeding his land","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-03-24T22:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jonny ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":326.21},{"due_date":"2011-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":347.93},{"due_date":"2011-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":354.17},{"due_date":"2011-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":366.99},{"due_date":"2011-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":382.18},{"due_date":"2011-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":394.1},{"due_date":"2011-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":409.35},{"due_date":"2011-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":419.07}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.61},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.57},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.87},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.56},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140.13},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":144.51},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150.09},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":153.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":140.02,"local_amount":381.87,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:32:20Z","rounded_local_amount":389.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206196423,"comment":null},{"amount":148.63,"local_amount":405.36,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:41:11Z","rounded_local_amount":413.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211270106,"comment":null},{"amount":153.83,"local_amount":419.55,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:32:53Z","rounded_local_amount":427.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216550121,"comment":null},{"amount":70.44,"local_amount":192.11,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:14:10Z","rounded_local_amount":195.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221718797,"comment":null},{"amount":138.82,"local_amount":378.59,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:14:16Z","rounded_local_amount":386.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350263,"comment":null},{"amount":144.51,"local_amount":394.1,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:47:41Z","rounded_local_amount":402.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232850745,"comment":null},{"amount":150.09,"local_amount":409.35,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:58:15Z","rounded_local_amount":417.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238665931,"comment":null},{"amount":153.66,"local_amount":419.07,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:43Z","rounded_local_amount":427.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621095,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-03-25T15:08:38Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":284796,"name":"Nyame","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nyame B. runs two businesses: she is a seamstress and she also sells palm oil in Ntranoa, near Elmina.

Viene removiendo la tierra hace 21 a\u00f1os en sus propias parcelas, en tiempos de cosecha cuenta con el apoyo de sus hijos y  peones quienes se encargan de cosechar y trasladar los frutos hasta los puntos de secado.

This hardworking gentleman is in a common law marriage with Valentina, age 45, and they have two children, Ronald (age 18) and Roel (age 16).  They live in their own home in the District of Quimbiri.  Lucio is the breadwinner of the family.  As a young boy, his parents taught him how to plow the soil and now he knows about the hard work that is required for farming.  He has four hectares of land on which he grows coffee, cacao, and coca leaves.  Lucio has been cultivating his own land for 21 years and receives assistance from his children during harvest time.  He also hires workers who are in charge of picking and drying the crops.  What he enjoys most about his job is harvesting his crops because he feels that producing quality output is his reward for months of hard work.  He considers the most difficult part to be transporting his products from the community of Quimbiri Alto to the collection centers in the Districts of Quimbiri and San Francisco.  These places offer the best prices for his products.  The loan he is requesting will be used to buy wood to remodel the fa\u00e7ade of his house by replacing the planks that have deteriorated with new ones.  Now his highest priority is to cultivate coffee since there is greater demand from foreign markets.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is Lucio\u2019s first loan with MFP and he is willing to complete his payments so that he can access subsequent loans.  He is grateful that the institution has approved this loan.  With the 2500 PEN he requested, Lucio will purchase wooden planks to replace the ones that have deteriorated and improve the fa\u00e7ade of his house.

She lives in her own home with her husband, Melit\u00f3n, a bus conductor who is 42, and two of their four children.  For more than five years she has been selling beauty products.  Before that she embroidered sweaters, which she still does.\r\n\r\nShe enjoys her work and interacting and counseling people on what type of cosmetics they should buy.  She always carries with her catalogues so she can make suggestions to her customers, who usually are the mothers of her son's friends.  She doesn't have to spend a lot of time at her job and is always meeting new customers so business is profitable.  Sometimes she runs the risk of not being paid punctually by new customers, so she must take time to go around making collections.\r\n\r\nBut despite the obstacles she does not shy away from her business.  One of her most pressing issues is to buy more merchandise so that at some point in the future she can buy a sewing machine and set up a dress shop in her home.  This is her 22nd loan through MFP and she says: \"they trust her and are sure whe will pay it back on time as she always has done\", since she would like to count on future loans.  She plans to use the loan to buy more beauty products so she can supply the pending orders she has.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":737665,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy more beauty products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-03-25T10:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Evangelina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":208.86},{"due_date":"2011-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":224.37},{"due_date":"2011-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":232.08},{"due_date":"2011-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":244.92},{"due_date":"2011-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":254.28},{"due_date":"2011-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":267.39},{"due_date":"2011-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":278.55},{"due_date":"2011-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":289.55}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.71},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.34},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.12},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.79},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.17},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.93},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.98},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.96}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":75.71,"local_amount":208.86,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:33:00Z","rounded_local_amount":210.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206196425,"comment":null},{"amount":81.34,"local_amount":224.37,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:41:46Z","rounded_local_amount":226.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211270108,"comment":null},{"amount":84.12,"local_amount":232.08,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:33:35Z","rounded_local_amount":234.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216550123,"comment":null},{"amount":88.78,"local_amount":244.92,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:48:18Z","rounded_local_amount":247,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232850747,"comment":null},{"amount":290.08,"local_amount":800.22,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:42:22Z","rounded_local_amount":807,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621097,"comment":null},{"amount":104.97,"local_amount":289.55,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:49:45Z","rounded_local_amount":292,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250836411,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-03-26T00:29:12Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T10:49:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":284847,"name":"Diana Lizeth","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Diana es una persona que trabaja como maestra y directora en un Jard\u00edn de ni\u00f1os   ella y su esposo tienen una peque\u00f1a hija  y donde viven  actualmente les esta haciendo falta el port\u00f3n del frente del domicilio ellos han decidido instalar este port\u00f3n por la seguridad de su peque\u00f1a hija ya que en ocasiones se sale de la casa y como es muy peque\u00f1a, ellos temen que en alg\u00fan momento pase alg\u00fan auto a alta velocidad y pueda  ocasionar  un accidente  donde   su  hija se   encuentre  perjudicada.","en":"Diana works as a teacher and director of a kindergarten and she and her husband have a young daughter.

She really enjoys her business and is always visiting her customers.  As soon as her customers make requests, she heads to the department stores in the middle of Lima.  If, however, they request footwear, she travels to Chiclayo province where she can buy wholesale, for a lower price.

In this way she will make more sales which will allow her to support herself financially and continue helping her son to improve himself."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":737201,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"to buy vegetables such as carrots, potatoes, cabbages, green chilis, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"San Salvador,  San Salvador","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2011-03-25T16:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":850,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Santos","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-02-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":850,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2011-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2011-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2011-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2011-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2011-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2011-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2011-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2011-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2011-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2012-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2012-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":70.87}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":70.83,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:10:34Z","rounded_local_amount":70.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201228400,"comment":null},{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":70.83,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-20T07:44:40Z","rounded_local_amount":70.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206733266,"comment":null},{"amount":41.96,"local_amount":41.96,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-16T08:00:00Z","rounded_local_amount":41.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211388574,"comment":null},{"amount":99.7,"local_amount":99.7,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:31:51Z","rounded_local_amount":99.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216448744,"comment":null},{"amount":31.5,"local_amount":31.5,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:13:13Z","rounded_local_amount":31.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221612806,"comment":null},{"amount":68.85,"local_amount":68.85,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:22:46Z","rounded_local_amount":68.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":226982083,"comment":null},{"amount":71.35,"local_amount":71.35,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-20T07:44:57Z","rounded_local_amount":71.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":233430730,"comment":null},{"amount":74.38,"local_amount":74.38,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:20:25Z","rounded_local_amount":74.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238545711,"comment":null},{"amount":76.63,"local_amount":76.63,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:13:11Z","rounded_local_amount":76.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244505313,"comment":null},{"amount":243.97,"local_amount":243.97,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:17:29Z","rounded_local_amount":243.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250712798,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-03-26T06:35:47Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T09:17:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":284913,"name":"Rebeca Yolanda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La socia pertenece al banco comunal\u201d VILCANOTA\u201d; El banco est\u00e1 ubicado en el distrito D.

In 2005, she established her grocery store business.  Working seven days a week, eight hours a day, she supports her family.  She has already received and successfully repaid two loans from Patan BPW and used her most recent loan to buy groceries.  In the future, Mira hopes to improve the economic condition of her family.  She thanks you for your support.  \r\n\r\nIn the Kathmandu Valley, the small grocery store, called a pasal, is an important part of the local economy.  Fresh produce, milk, and staples such as rice, lentils, and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home.  Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margain.  By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability.  While a typical pasal might be no more than 100 square feet, they are always full of bargaining customers, incoming produce, and shrewd businesswomen. \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.  Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women.

With a Kiva loan, BPW's borrowers are able to purchase greater amounts of seed and fertilizer.  With more seeds and fertilizer, a borrower is able to grow cash crops to be sold in the local market.  Such crops allow households to move beyond subsistence farming and provide much-needed cash income throughout the year. \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women.

S. is from the village of Poblacion, Don Carlos, Bukidnon. She is 51 years old. Amelita is married and has two adult children. To make a living, Amelita owns and operates a mini-restaurant. The main source of income for the business comes from serving a variety of different meals, like chicken and pork adobo, bulalo, and fried fish to customers in the local community. Amelita has been engaged in her business for over seven years and earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Amelita joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Amelita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 21,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional ingredients and working capital. Amelita is requesting a new loan of 25,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase raw ingredients and drinks needed for the restaurant. This loan will be the seventh loan taken out by Amelita from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand it. \r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>About HSPFI:<\/b><br>\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

Alma is requesting a new loan of 25,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional dressed chickens as well as hotdogs to offer for sale. This loan will be the seventh loan taken out by Alma from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Consuelo S. is from the village of Linglingay, Cauayan City, Isabela. She is 46 years old. Consuelo is the group leader of a 21-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nConsuelo is married. To make a living, Consuelo owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for fattening and sale. Consuelo has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 4000 PHP every three months.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Consuelo joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Consuelo is requesting a loan of 6000 PHP, which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This loan will be her 1st loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva
