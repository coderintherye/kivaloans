She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 10,000. Maricel is now borrowing PHP 10,000 so that she can continue to purchase more stock to sell. This will be her 9th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 16,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Maricel aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

She lives in Purok 1, Brgy. 1, Sipalay City, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2005 and has improved her living conditions with the help of loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her carinderia (eatery), she is gradually gaining more economically stability for her family. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 15,600. \r\n\r\nMary Ann is now borrowing PHP 23,000 so that she can continue to fund the operations of her food products.   This will be her 11th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 20,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Mary Ann aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\"). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon--a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Talacdan, Cauayan, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  buying and selling charcoal\/firewood, and selling rice. Her husband, Leonardo, who is 62 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have four children who are between 26 and 36 years old. \r\n\r\nFlorencia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2001 because she aspired to something better for her family. With the help of her past 16 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Florencia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6,300, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 17th loan, she is borrowing PHP 18,000, which she intends to use for additional capital for firewood\/charcoal to sell and to buy a vehicle  so that she can continue to save up for future savings and expansion of her business. Florencia C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\"). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon--a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

T. is a married woman who lives in Prk. Carpo, Brgy. Casay, Dalaguete, Cebu. She earns her living by operating a Sari-Sari (general) store. Her husband, Aurelio T., is 57 years old, works as a Carpenter to earn his living, and helps his wife with her business. They have one child who is 20 years old. Lolita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 5 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Lolita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 14,000, increasing her family's standard of living. This time, for her 6th loan, she is borrowing PHP 11,000, which she intends to use to pay for more stock to sell, so that she can continue to save up for her family's future. Lolita T. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She earns her living by operating 3 businesses: food production\/sales, a general store and an entertainment business. Her husband, Larry T., is 49 years old and works as a laborer to earn his living. He also helps in his wife's business activities. They have three children aged between 19 and 24 years old. Gilda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1997 because she hoped for something better for her family. With the help of her past 18 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Gilda has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 29,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, raising the family's standard of living. This time, for her 19th loan, she is borrowing PHP 30,000, which she intends to use to buy more stock for the general store and spices for her food production business. She wants to continue to save up for her children's future education and for home appliances. Gilda T. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n<p>About NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

He's married and has 3 daughters: twenty, nineteen and fifteen years old. The former two attend a university, while the younger daughter goes to school. They live in the Absheron region. For seven years, Farman has sold women's clothing, which his wife knits. Recently, his daughters have also started to knit (they really enjoy making interesting new designs on the clothing) and contribute their work for sale.

Ikromjon has been a livestock farmer. He breeds sheep and cattle. He is married and he has 3 children for whom he needs to support and give a proper education. Ikromjon has improved his financial situation considering that his father is also cattle breeder and from his childhood he has gained a rich experience in the livestock business.

Ikromjon is very grateful to everyone who is helping him to improve his living.  \r\n\r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Soro is a hard-working woman who has fought to provide for her family and to educate her son, who today is a working adult, thanks to her example. She would like to request a loan of $1500 USD in order to purchase additional sheep to increase her inventory and to meet customer demands. Soro believes this will lead to greater revenue and, ultimately, greater profit for her family. In the future, she would like to reinvest the earnings generated by this loan back into her business. She will then purchase additional sheep and increase their income further. Soro deeply appreciates the trust and support you are giving her.     \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Nuriddin is married. His family lives in Shahrituz, Southern Tajikistan. Nuriddin sells household chemicals and perfumes in his shop. Small ventures like Nuriddin\u2019s become the only source of income for families in remote parts of Tajikistan. Nuriddin has been in the trade for 6 years. His business is characterized by stability and positive performance. Inventory he sells is always in demand as people need dishwasher and laundry soap, shampoos, and perfumes and other household chemicals. Nuriddin wants to see his business grow in the future, which is why he is requesting a loan of $3000 USD to increase his turnover capital. He is hoping to boost further development of his business with this additional assistance. \r\n\r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She has had her business for 5 years, starting with a loan she had. She plans to use this loan to invest in her business by buying different beauty and cosmetic products. She will use the profits to buy some medicine for her mother and save because she wants to have a bigger locale for her business.

In this way, Elisa became in charge of finding new customers. To do this she uses a selection of demonstration fabrics for the client to choose from. With a catalogue in hand, she shows them the many different designs she and her husband can make. Her workshop is located in their house, and this is where the furniture is made and the customers choose. The quality and the style determine the price of the service, but becasue of the fair prices they charge they have earned many customers. As well as this activity, Elisa also offers a beauty therapy service to her neighbours. \r\n\r\nGoing forward, she would like to improve the furniture workshop with more tools, and stock up on new designs of upholstery fabric. She would also like to open a beauty salon. This is her second loan from [field partner] MF. She is happy knowing that she can access financial support, and is grateful to be part of her communal bank because all the members are responsible people who support one another. She is grateful also to all the people who will be her lenders, because the loan will be very useful in developing her business further.

a dryer, among other things."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":651192,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture

She is a divorced mom and makes her home here in a simple structure with a child. She says that her most difficult challenges are to work hard and return to Haiti, where her family lives. In the meantime, she plans to continue enjoying attending church and sharing with friends.\r\n\r\nLouise is excited to be taking her 6th loan with Esperanza after having successfully repaid her previous loan and expanded her business. She has been operating her business for more than 5 years, starting with some savings. She plans to use this loan to invest in her business by buying flour, butter, oil, charcoal and other items. She will use the profits to save and plan her future, while she dreams to return to Haiti.\r\n\r\nThis Esperanza associate began with us because of the opportunity to get loans, even as a foreigner. Her story is representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican (many of whom recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti) clients generally. Her group is located in the rural areas surrounding La Romana, where the sugarcane harvest and tourist industry dominate the economy.

In the meantime, she plans to continue enjoying attending church. \r\n\r\nLouise is excited to be taking her fifth loan with Esperanza after having successfully repaid her previous loan and grown her business. She has had her business for more than 25 years, starting with some savings. She plans to use this loan to invest in her business by buying dozens of pants, shirts, skirts, t-shirts and other items. She will use the profits to buy building materials for her house, while she dreams to improve her business and to live safely.\r\n\r\nThis Esperanza associate began with us because of the opportunity to have loans, even though they are foreigners.

Her husband has a welding workshop located in their house and has been in the profession for more than 20 years.

She started selling coffee, sugar and corn and now sells a variety of products. \r\n \r\nHer dream is to have a well-stocked grocery store where she will not have to tell her costumers, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t have\u2026\u201d. She is requesting the loan to buy more products for the store.\r\n \r\nMrs. Florentina J., who sells clothing, told us that she opened her business with savings she and her husband had from the sales of pears, apples and peaches. She requested a loan from FAPE and used it to stock her store. Her clothing has been in good demand, so she is requesting this loan to buy more merchandise. This would allow her to continue helping with her children\u2019s education and feeding and improving their lives because they have the future ahead of them.

Solicita el prestamo para la compra de maiz a menor costo porque en esta temporada de cosecha en la regi\u00f3n el precio del maiz disminuye, es una estrategia que ha utilizado y le ha dado buenos resultados.

It is a symbol of the region along with other symbols which characterize the town of Aculco which is considered a \u201cPueblo M\u00e1gico\u201d (Magic Town).  The group is located in the State of Mexico and has 10 members.\r\n\r\nAurelia G. is the group's treasurer.  She is 36 years old and completed her primary education.  She has one child and has been selling tortillas for 7 years.  She is requesting this loan to buy corn at a lower price because during this harvest season in the region, the price of corn falls.  It is a strategy which she has used in the past and it has had good results.\r\n\r\nHer customers believe that Aurelia's product is good and has that special touch.  This is why they consume her product.  Aurelia delivers to people's homes in neighboring communities.  She also has customers in the State of Queretaro (who consume her product every week) and in the State of Puebla (who consume her product every fortnight).

In the meantime she plans to continue enjoying the kitchen. She likes to cook; that's why her business is a place where you can find different and good dishes.\n\nMoraima is excited to be taking her first loan with Esperanza. She has had her business for about five years, starting with savings. She plans to use this loan to invest in her business by buying vegetables, meats, rice, flour, oil, etc. She will use the profits to invest in her business. \n\nThis associate began with Esperanza because she heard about the loan and found it very attractive as some of her friends are doing business with this loan.

P\u00faa is a cheerful mother of two children aged 2 and 17.  She lives with her husband who works in the field of logistics.  They both share big dreams.  For Leyanis, the adversities she has faced have been the driving force behind her determination as a businesswoman and her achieving her independence together with her young son who is now very healthy but for whom she had to leave her job to devote herself to him because he was sick in the past.  However, Leyanis never abandoned her dream of getting ahead in life and making an income which would benefit everybody in her household, alongside her husband who is committed to the same effort.\r\n\r\nLeyanis started her business as a saleswoman with special added value: she studied marketing at university and has a natural gift which turns everything she touches beautiful; this is how she does her work in her small store called \u201cMiscel\u00e1nea Detalles y Papeler\u00eda L.K.\u201d, (Miscellany, Little Gifts and Stationery L.K) 'little gifts' that her customers buy and exchange at special times such as birthdays and graduations.\r\n\r\nLeyanis is very intuitive and creative.  She demonstrates this in her own style during the promotions she runs such as 'Buy one Get one Free' or 'Buy a special article and enter into a Christmas raffle' which is her current promotion taking advantage of Christmas.  She makes these offers to make her sales attractive.  This is why her business growth has gone in the right direction and she is very social, productive and responsible in everything she does.  This is how she is affiliated to many specialist magazines.  With one she promotes perfumes, with another she promotes bags, with another cosmetics, with another clothes and more besides.  Those who know her don't hesitate to offer her opportunities to work with products.  This is currently the case with various merchandise that a representative from the beautiful country of Panama will bring her on consignment, that is to say the representative delivers the products and if she doesn't manage to sell them she returns them.  This seems a great opportunity that Leyanis will accept.\r\n\r\nThis is Leyanis' first Kiva loan and she will use it to buy toys and cosmetics for Christmas deals that she is working on from this moment in order to respond to the sales opportunity that the month of December, and particularly the end of this period, generates."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":651314,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy toys and cosmetics to make Christmas deals and sell them in the month of December","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad Atl\u00e0ntico","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2010-11-27T13:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leyanis Beatriz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1500000,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":105656},{"due_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":114389},{"due_date":"2011-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":116582},{"due_date":"2011-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":118816},{"due_date":"2011-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":121093},{"due_date":"2011-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":123414},{"due_date":"2011-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":125780},{"due_date":"2011-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":128190},{"due_date":"2011-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":130647},{"due_date":"2011-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":133152},{"due_date":"2011-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":135704},{"due_date":"2011-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":146577}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.35},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.01},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.17},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.37},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.82},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.08},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.37},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.68},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.01},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.38},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":56.35,"local_amount":105656,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:14:36Z","rounded_local_amount":106619.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188688488,"comment":null},{"amount":61.01,"local_amount":114389,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-16T08:40:44Z","rounded_local_amount":115432.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196001129,"comment":null},{"amount":62.18,"local_amount":116582,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:05:11Z","rounded_local_amount":117645.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206157282,"comment":null},{"amount":72.2,"local_amount":135381,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:18:13Z","rounded_local_amount":136615.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211230294,"comment":null},{"amount":64.85,"local_amount":121592,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:08:48Z","rounded_local_amount":122700.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216509162,"comment":null},{"amount":56.16,"local_amount":105305,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:16:59Z","rounded_local_amount":106265.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238614192,"comment":null},{"amount":178.95,"local_amount":335539,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:07:21Z","rounded_local_amount":338599.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250779542,"comment":null},{"amount":248.3,"local_amount":465556,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:20:29Z","rounded_local_amount":469801.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257188842,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-11-29T20:44:24Z","paid_date":"2012-02-15T10:20:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":252361,"name":"Lucero Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Juana es socia del Bancomunal Lucero, que inicia su sexto ciclo con 15 socias.

He will purchase cleaning supplies, baby clothing, and household goods, which he will pack with Christmas decorations, to attract the attention of his clients, during the season in which friends, neighbors, and relatives exchange gifts. His dream is to have a great, well-stocked store and his own house. However, his greatest challenge is the seasons in which sales decrease, and he has to figure out how to attract clients with low prices and a nice display. Otoniel is a very hard-working man with a lot of discipline in his job. His goals are clear, and he knows where his business is going. Currenlty, he has a working capital of $3.440.000 COP and a profit margin of 42.8%. He projects it will reach 50% with his new credit, keeping in mind the season in which he is making the investment in his business, which is highly commercial and profitable, and he will be able to respond to his clients' requests."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":650114,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"He will buy

This hard-working woman has operated a farming business for 8 years.  She grows avocados and platanos, but her coffee crop is her main source of income.  She has 4 hectares of land that produce a good grade of coffee bean and she wants to find other markets where she can get mO. money for her crop.

Its 8 members have shown to date responsibility and the desire for self improvement each in her own business, either dependently or independently.  All, however, coinciD. in giving only the best to their loved ones and to improve daily.  Such is the case of:  Lidia who learned how to work as a micro businesswoman 12 years ago when her husband was laid off from his job.  \r\n\r\nShe figured out how to make knitted wool sweaters and cushions which helped her feed her children who are still minors.  Since income was still insufficient, she decided to also sell beauty products.  The sale of knitted items was good until the El Ni\u00f1o weather phenomenon arrived affecting it and causing losses due to the unexpected weather change (summer).  Not being defeated, however, as she tells us, she had the great idea to make delicious sweets at home like Mazamorra Morada (jelly-like dessert maD. from purple maize), Bundt cakes, chocolate and vanilla cakes.  She also maD. potatoes with eggs, potato and ocopa (potato with peanut sauce) or potato with cream.  She would take her desserts either on trays or in pots to sell them.  She had to walk long blocks to sell in markets, stores, car repair shops, hardware stores.  In time, she acquired more customers thanks to the good service and taste of her home maD. products.\r\n\r\nLidia then became better trained in pastry making and realized she did it quite well.  She now makes cakes for all occasions and social events like fifteen-year birthday parties, weddings, baby showers, school graduation parties, birthdays or any other one she is asked to do.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

In 2000, with the revenues from selling groceries, Cholpon with her husband started their cattle-breeding business. They worked hard and managed to enlarge the number of cattle to three bull-calves and one milk cow. With the revenues from this activity, they were able to pay for education to their son, Daniar. \n\nThis year, Cholpon decided to broaden her selling business, so she turned one of the rooms in her house into a small shop. Now, she plans to obtain a loan of 50,000 Kyrgyz Soms to broaden her assortment of goods. It will allow her to increase her sales and also acquire new customers.

P. is from the village of Libertad, Quezon, Bukidnon. She is 31 years-old and married with two school-aged children. To make a living, Merriam owns and operates a business in the retail sector running a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income comes from buying and selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap, toothpaste, canned goods and junk food in the local community. She also runs a business doing videoke or karaoke where customers pays five pesos for every song.  Merriam has been engaged in her business for over 11 years and earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2000, Merriam joined Kiva partner HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Merriam has successfully repaid a previous loan of 23,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to buy and sell.  Merriam is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and to provide working capital. This loan will be the 18th loan taken out by Merriam from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":651634,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

A. is from the village of Menongan, Quezon, Bukidnon. He is 55 years-old and married with nine adult children. To make a living, Benbinedo owns and operates a business in the retail sector running a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income comes from buying and selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap, toothpaste, canned goods and junk food in the local community. Benbinedo has been engaged in his business for over two years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Benbinedo joined Kiva partner HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Benbinedo has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to buy and sell. Benbinedo is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and to provide working capital. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Benbinedo from HSPFI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve and expand his business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":651637,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

has successfully repaid her first Kiva loan! With the loan she financed and sustained the increasing demand for her bamboo furniture set making business. She is very thankful for your support and the opportunity to borrow money from Kiva. \r\n\r\nHerminia is very happy that with the loan she was able to provide satisfactory services, without delays, to her regular customers when requesting their orders. She wishes to access a larger loan to expand her bamboo set (furniture) business in order to earn more profit. Herminia thanks KIVA for providing her with the opportunity to increase her income. Your support is important to her family and they are very grateful.\r\n\r\nPrior to ASHI, Herminia had no access to capital to support her business endeavour. She joined Kiva partner ASHI in order to follow her dream of providing a decent life for her family.  From this inspiration, she took a loan and started her own bamboo set business. As she continues to take loans from ASHI and save some of her profits, she will be able to grow her business. \r\n\r\nWith the loan, Herminia has noticed that her monthly income has almost doubled since she has attracted new customers with her additional inventory of bamboo furniture.\r\n\r\nNow she is requesting another Kiva loan of 25,000 Philippine pesos to maintain her business and to purchase an inventory of raw materials needed. \r\n\r\nWith the support of ASHI and Kiva, she is hopeful that her business will generate a steady income which will improve her financial stability and her family\u2019s quality of life to lift them out of poverty.
