is 25 years old. He lives in Koti village, Tavush marz, with his wife, his son and grandmother. \r\n\r\nArman has a farm where he breeds pigs, turkeys, chickens and rabbits. Also he grows wheat. He sells pork, eggs, chicken and turkey meat to bulk buyers. But Arman's principal source of income is fodder threshing: his fellow villagers bring fodder to him and Arman grinds it for a fee.

Two years ago, she had the opportunity to buy an urban transportation concession and a bus to work it.  Martha knows that for a woman this type of work is risky, due to the crime that exists in the country, and so she had the idea of renting out her bus and in this way receiving income from it.  At this time, the bus needs some maintenance work, and so she is requesting a loan to buy spare parts, engine oil, and to pay a mechanic to do the repairs.

The village is known for rapid development and for its peaceful and orderly nature.\r\n\r\nHer small store is open from 6 a.m. until 7 p.m. Sweetie Pie decided to open her store because her husband's income is not large enough to support all the educational needs of their children.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Sweetie Pie is using her income to pay for the cost of having two children in college. She is seeking a loan to buy additional inventory for her store, including soft drinks, cooking oil, sugar, vinegar, canned foods and other items.

Their marriage is gifted with three children: Shermae Michelle \u2013 an 18-year-old first year nursing student; Sermil Micheal \u2013 a 15-year-old junior high school student, and Shella Mae \u2013 a 12-year-old Grade 6 elementary student. The family lives in Barangay Magsaysay Naguillan.<p>\r\n\r\nMildred\u2019s store has been a big help in their family, as each week she can earn a gross income of at least P 5000, budgeting that income to support the studies of her eldest, since the nursing course is very expensive, and the educational needs of her other two children. Some of the earnings are also used to maintain their corn and rice farming business.<p>\r\n\r\nTo further sustain her store and farming business, Mildred is requesting a loan as additional capital with which she will buy more goods to offer in her store. The said amount will make her store profitable and hopefully enable her to convert it into a grocery store.

Begaim and her husband, who is a tractor driver during the agricultural season and a construction worker the rest of the year, have two younger children, who are still financially dependent on them. The house the family is living in is fairly old and any furnishings made were helpless.

The loan will be used to buy more traditional Ugandan dresses, called gomeses, for resale, and will help Fracis to generate greater profits and to lay a foundation for a house on the plot his family has already purchased.

Agnes hopes to continue expanding her business to provide her family with a good standard of living and a good quality of education.

For twenty years she has been running a dairy business, distributing milk and homemade milk products to regular buyers.  It took much effort and trying several different types of businesses before she focused on milk production. \r\n\r\nFor a long period of time, Olmaskhan was a farmer, gathering crops each fall.  She later switched to retail, selling food products in a local market.  After that, she bought cattle and made the first attempts at milk retail. The business was started with the small amount of 5,000 soms.  She now makes twice that amount each month.  Olmaskhan has two young kids and, not long ago, gave birth to a third child. The toddler needs care and good conditions. Olmaskhan hopes to receive her portion of the loan, which she will spend on the purchase of a baby carriage. \r\n\r\n --- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (being environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

is Wilma, 43, resident of Pasay City, Philippines. She is married to Allan, a vendor. They have three children. She, together with her husband and children, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n  \r\nWilma operates a buy and sell business. What she basically does is buy general merchandise from wholesalers, then sell it for a little profit. Her products are footwear, sandals and other products of the like. Customers are attracted to buy due to the low selling prices and the many options she offers. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 300 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities and varieties of sandals and slippers to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nWilma dreams to have her own house someday and also to be able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business.

is Lucena, 52, resident of Batasan, Quezon City, Philippines. She is married to Leonilo, a driver, and is the mother of her only child.  She, together with her husband, manages their own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nLucena operates a rug-making business. She mainly offers rugs, from those small ones pictured to the much larger doormats. As rugs are a major part of Filipino housekeeping and cleaning, rugs are one of the most common products that can be bought, sometimes even from a peddler while you are riding in a speeding jeepney down the highway. She also earns additional income from direct-selling products. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php200 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php8,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of raw materials like fabric, thread and other materials for her business. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nLucena hopes to grow her business in the coming years and dreams to be able to give her child a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members* to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":183.33,"image":{"id":890000,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"

is 32 years old and lives in the town of Kasese in the Fort Portal region of Uganda. She is married and has four children, with two of them currently in school. For the past year, Margret has been working hard to manage her retail shop, which sells sugar and soap. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Margret has requested a loan of 1,500,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda.

Leng is a 35-year-old married woman who lives in Kompong Speu province. She lives with her husband and two children who attend a local state school. Since 1998, she has earned a living by cultivating a rice crop. She learned this skill from her parents very well. \r\n\r\nShe normally makes around $1.50USD per day to help with the family's expenses. With this little profit, Mrs. Leng cannot cover all of the family\u2019s needs.

Having a higher education, Mirkiyaz spent over 20 years working as a dispatcher for the Distribution Power Plant in the Aksy village, and he is known as a responsible and goal-oriented person.  In order to find an additional source of income for his family that grew due to grandchildren, Mirkiyaz decided to start a business of selling dried plums in 2009.  This is considered to be a profitable business for the local residents.  Mirkiyaz treated his business carefully and with much responsibility, which allowed him to produce over 5 tons of dried fruits (dried plums).  In order to further expand his business, Mirkiyaz requested a loan in the sum of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy plums for drying from the local residents.  He plans to use the profits from the loan to expand his small business.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":853.91,"image":{"id":890039,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Republic).  He is married and is raising four children.  Japaraly was born into a simple and large family of a farmer.  Since childhood, he helped his father to take care of a large farm, especially because his father also worked as a driver at the local collective farm and needed help to take care of livestock.  After graduating from school, Japaraly went to serve in the army.  In 1989, Japaraly got married after returning from the army and also started attending a retail college that same year.  He spent two years in college and then got a job as a salesperson at a department store, and then as a security guard at a meat processing plant.  At that time, Japaraly and his wife lived with the parents.  They decided to move out of the parents' home in 1993, and Japaraly and his family moved to their relatives' farm in the Sargo village (Panfilovsk district, Kyrgyzstan).  At that time, they already had two children.  Japaraly took care of his relatives' livestock and also increased the quantity of his own livestock at this same farm because it had suitable conditions for keeping and breeding livestock.  Having lived on this farm for six years and increasing the quantity of his own livestock, Japaraly decided to return to live with the parents because he was their youngest son.  According to Kyrgyz traditions, the youngest son has to take care of his aging parents.  At that time, he had several dairy cows and calves.  In 2009, having sold some of the livestock, Japaraly bought a one-bedroom apartment in the town of Karabalta.  Currently, thanks to his entrepreneurship and persistence, Japaraly has two dairy cows, seven bulls and fifteen sheep.  In order to further expand his business, Japaraly requested a loan in the sum of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy livestock.  Japaraly plans to expand his farm.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":889283,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Bukara village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2011-10-07T16:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Japaraly","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"loan_amount":2225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":35000},{"due_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":35000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":667.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":778.75},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":778.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2011-11-04T16:34:22Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":344095,"name":"Anne","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Anne is married and blessed with two children who are still in school.
