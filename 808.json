Wendy is a charismatic, hard-working and, above all, entrepreneurial young woman. She works in agriculture, growing mainly dry grains such as corn and beans, which are in high demand in her area. This is one of her main sources of income as her partner's wage does not cover the continually increasing expenses of running their home. Wendy has been doing this type of work for a long time, and she has achieved good results from it. Many people come to buy their corn or beans from Wendy because she sells them at a good, affordable price. She is concerned about how to continue investing in her business in the future as she does not have the necessary resources to invest in raw materials and the rent payable on the land she uses for planting. This led her to the decision to apply to INTEGRAL for this loan to invest in buying: manure, corn and rice seeds, poisons for dealing with plagues and to rent a larger portion of land for cultivation. This is so that she can continue to earn the same level of income from her work, which has worked well by allowing her to provide her family with their daily bread.

She began her business because just after she concluded her national primary school education, she lost her father and by then her mother was seriously sick so that she could neither look after her nor support her education. So therefore, she decided to assist neighbors in doing business with the intention that somebody would take care of her schooling, but unfortunately, that did not happen.\r\n\r\nSo she finally made up her mind to continue business and started to raise funds and started her own business. Working six days a week and 10 hours a day, she earns about SLL 1,500,000 every month from this business. \r\n\r\nShe would like a loan in the amount of SLL 5,000,000.

She is applying for a loan of 20,000 Kenya shillings to increase the stock of retail items like cooking fat, salt, sugar, flour, etc.\r\n\r\nDespite the challenges of the high cost of products and the overall inflation which has reduced the purchasing power of most customers, Martha\u2019s ambition is to own a supermarket.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1038387,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy a stock of retail items like cooking fat, salt, sugar, flour, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"malindi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-3.216667 40.116667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":203,"posted_date":"2012-03-16T14:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-15T14:10:03Z","loan_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Martha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":909},{"due_date":"2012-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":909},{"due_date":"2012-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":909},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":909},{"due_date":"2012-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":909},{"due_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":909},{"due_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":909},{"due_date":"2012-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":909},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":909},{"due_date":"2012-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":909},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":909},{"due_date":"2012-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":909},{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":909},{"due_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":909},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":909},{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":909},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":909},{"due_date":"2012-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":909},{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":909},{"due_date":"2012-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":909},{"due_date":"2012-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":909},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":911}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.36},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.37},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.36},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.36},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.36},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.37},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.36},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.36},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.36},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.37},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.36},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.36},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.36},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.37},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.36},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.36},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.36},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.37},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.36},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.36},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.36},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.39}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-03-17T14:09:49Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":403325,"name":"Nhom","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nhom, 53, is married with two daughters and one son.

She is married and raising three children.  Anarkul was born in 1955 into a simple family with many children.  Her father was a paramedic, and mother was a seamstress.  Being the oldest in the family, Anarkul helped her parents with the household since childhood and took care of her six brothers and sisters.  She graduated from the Orlovskaya secondary school in her native village and followed her father's footsteps by going to a medical college in Bishkek after school.  In 1975, after finishing college, she got a job as a nurse at the Sokulukskaya district hospital.  This same year, Anarkul got married and gave birth to a daughter and son.  In 1978, Anarkul and her husband moved to the Alekseevka village (Jayl district, Chuyskaya region), where they bought a plot of land.  Anarkul got a job as a paramedic at the Alekseevka paramedic-ambulatory site, and her husband got a job as a leading specialist at the Jayl district prosecutor's office.  In 1980, Anarkul got a job as a teacher at the Karabalta medical college, and gave birth to her youngest daughter in 1986.  During the years of perestroika, Anarkul and her husband started to build a large house.  Because the money lost its value, their salaries were not enough to cover even regular food.  This is why Anarkul had to go a market, where she resold fruits and vegetables.  Thanks to their hard work, persistence and mutual support, Anarkul and her husband built a good, large house, raised and educated their children.  In 2002, Anarkul received a title of \"Excellent Healthcare Professional.\"\r\n\r\nCurrently, Anarkul works as a teacher at the Karablta medical college and is also involved in animal husbandry.  Having started this business with an amount of 30,000 som, Anarkul was able to grow her business to have a monthly profit of 15,000 som.  At the present time, her business has one heifer and ten sheep.  In order to further develop her business, Anarkul requested a loan in the amount of 135,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy five heads of bulls.  She plans to invest the earnings from the loan into a further development of her business.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1040738,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Alekseevka village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-03-16T17:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-15T17:40:03Z","loan_amount":2925,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anarkul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":135000,"loan_amount":2925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4455},{"due_date":"2012-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":6141},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":6295},{"due_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":6452},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":6614},{"due_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":6779},{"due_date":"2012-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":6948},{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":7122},{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":7300},{"due_date":"2013-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":7483},{"due_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":7670},{"due_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":7861},{"due_date":"2013-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":8058},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":8259},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":8466},{"due_date":"2013-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":8678},{"due_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":8895},{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":11524}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.53},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.05},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.39},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":139.8},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.3},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.88},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150.54},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":154.31},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":158.16},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":162.14},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.18},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.32},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":174.59},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":178.95},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":183.43},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":188.02},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.72},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":249.69}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-03-24T00:50:09Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":401815,"name":"Yenis Ortiz Cardona","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Yenis Invirti\u00f3 su credikiva anterior en bisuter\u00eda, cacharrer\u00eda y jugueter\u00eda, productos con los que le fue muy bien,  pues aprovech\u00f3 la temporada precisa para hacer su gran venta.

She has a retail business.  At her sales location she displays merchandise like accessories, stationery, and various items.  When she started as a merchant 20 years ago she did so by selling beer.\r\n\t\r\nDue to health problems she later changed her business and started to sell all types of merchandise.  It was a small and very domestic market that gave her orders that she needed to fill.  However, little by little she was setting up a sales location in her own house.  She did so in order to sell items like pencils, cardboard, paper, women\u2019s accessories, and cologne, etc. that the neighbors need all of the time.  The business has gone very well for her.  She has managed to get her children ahead and improve their quality of life. \r\n\r\nHer Kiva loan is the 21st loan she has with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  This organization has supported her growth.  Through their loans she went from selling through a customer distribution system to having a general store or sales location where she can offer items that are greatly needed by children, adolescents, and adults.\r\n\r\nHer dream for growing is to have more prosperity than she currently has, to increase her inventory, and to have more customers.

A little more than nine years ago, Isaura decided to start working in her own business, selling articles for the home (kitchen items) from a catalog. She sells them to her friends and neighbors in the community, and \"thanks to God,\" over time she has found good customers who are willing to buy from her. \r\n\r\nHer business works like this: in the morning she takes care of her household tasks, and in the evening she takes her catalogs and goes out to show them to her customers and take orders. When she has sufficient orders, she buys the items, delivers them to her customers and collects the payments. She enjoys her business very much, since she runs it in her spare time and does not neglect her small children. Isaura needs this loan to invest in buying a variety of plates, glasses, pans and utensils to stock her business.

In the mornings she goes out to sell in the streets of the community. In the afternoons she kills chickens for the customers who will buy in the afternoon in order to prepare the chicken for their dinners.

on this name because everyone in their community is very devoted to this saint. Apart from the fact that there are very beautiful places here, many people make their living by doing handicrafts. \r\n\r\nThis story is about Socorro, as she is one of the members of this group. She is 35, and married to Domingo. They have three children, and all three are going to school; one is in first year of high school, another in second year of junior high school, and the youngest is in fourth year of primary school.   \r\n\r\nShe makes and sells bread, empanadas, and rolls, and has been doing this for two years.  She says she decided to start this business, because from a very young age, her mother taught her to make these products. She wanted to put into practice everything she learned. Apart from this, it is a very good source of income, and provides good earnings; it enablies her to secure her children's education and future. \r\n\r\nWith the loan she received, she intends to purchase more ingredients such as flour, eggs, salt, sugar, yeast, milk, rice, cinnamon, bananas, cooking oil, etc. Soco's goal, (that is how she is known in the community) is to make her business grow, as she thinking about building a small shop to set up a bakery in; and also to buy more cooking utensils that she needs. \r\n\r\nThis way she will earn more and better income, enabling her to continue supporting her children with their studies, so that they will have good professions.

She lives alone with her husband and children in the town of Koutiala. Tintina did not go to school; she was a victim of the time when girls did not have the right to go to school, and for this reason she became interested in the business which she learnt from her mother. She has been carrying out this business for more than ten years now and has a good reputation, because \"sounbala\" (a condiment made from pounding and fermenting \"n\u00e9r\u00e9\" nuts) is one of the most popular condiments with women, and thus she can make good money from this business. \r\n\r\nIn order to grow her business, Tintina joined the microfinance institution, Soro,Yiriwaso, six years ago. She has participated in six group loans (solidarity loans) which have all been repaid in full, and she is now on her fifth individual loan, the previous four having also been repaid in full. With this loan, she is planning to buy 10 sacks of \"n\u00e9r\u00e9\" nuts from stockists in Koutiala and these will be made up into \"sounbala\" and sold on a retail and wholesale basis and for cash in Bamako and Kayes to a customer base made up of women, \r\n\r\nShe is expecting to make a monthly profit of 120,000FCFA, which she is planning to use to repay interest to Soro and to contribute to improving her family's living conditions.  In this context, Tintina is planning to expand her business in the future.   \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1044055,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":"to buy  \"n\u00e9r\u00e9\" nuts","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"KOUTIALA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.383333 -5.466667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2012-03-17T14:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-16T14:00:04Z","loan_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tintina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2012-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2012-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2012-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2013-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-03-17T17:54:29Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":403608,"name":"Malkia Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tea, who is in her early 20s, is married.
