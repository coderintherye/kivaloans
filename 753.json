In the future, Vang hopes for her business to do well, to maintain a successful business, and to be able to buy more business supplies and equipment.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":72.5,"image":{"id":958295,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase poultry and cattle to raise.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"VN","country":"Viet Nam","town":"Thanh Ho\u00e1","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"16.166667 107.833333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":121,"posted_date":"2012-01-05T16:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vang","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"H\u1ed3ng ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dung","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"VND","disbursal_amount":15000000,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2012-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2012-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2012-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2012-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2012-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2012-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2013-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2013-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2013-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2013-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2013-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":750000},{"due_date":"2013-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":750000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.25},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.25},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.25},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.25},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.25},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.25},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.25},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.25},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.25},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.25},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.25},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.25},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.25},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.25},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.25},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.25},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.25},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.25},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.25},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":36.25,"local_amount":750000,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:15:30Z","rounded_local_amount":762156.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257181757,"comment":null},{"amount":36.25,"local_amount":750000,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:27:08Z","rounded_local_amount":762156.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263316139,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-05T23:55:11Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":378194,"name":"Gakurya","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gakuyra is a married man with two children, both of whom attend school.

At 21 years old, Adriana works selling merchandise such as shoes, blouses, accessories and other products to her family, friends and people in her neighborhood.  Her income is not a lot right now as she isn't selling a lot right now because she doesn't have enough stock.  Her supplier wouldn't open a line of credit for her because she is so new to the business.  For this reason Adriana is seeking for a loan that will allow her to stock her store and fill pending orders for her customers.  This will allow her to increase her income and improve her quality of life as well as that of her parents.

They have two children together, Emily (7 years old) and Andres (5 years old). They live together in their own house, located in the population center of Canayre, in Llochegua district. Daniel sells spirits in his small bar, which is located in the city where he lives. He has already been in business for over four years, and during this time he has overcome many difficulties, such as obtaining a license. Thanks to the good service he provides his customers, he has achieved higher profits and used them to buy his own house and a plot of farmland for growing cocoa. He generally works from 10:00 in the morning until 10:00 at night. The only inconvenience is that sometimes, when there are events, Daniel has to stay until the wee hours of the morning. This will be his second loan with Microfinanzas Prisma and he promises to make his repayments punctually.

Her eldest son had to quit studying to help his mother with her job, to then restart his career as a professor.

She is married, and from this relationship she has three children aged 9, 11, and 13, all students. Her husband is a cabinetmaker.\r\n\r\nShe is taking out the loan to help her husband, who has a cabinetmaking workshop in his house. There he transforms wood into beautiful works such as every kind of furniture his customers want, doors, and beds, among many other things. He works based on orders from his customers, who always come to him due to the quality of the products he delivers to them on the day he promised. This is why her husband has a good clientele, and why he has never lacked for work in the 15 years he has been working.\r\n\r\nWith this loan they are going to buy nails, glue, shellac, wood, and other raw materials to make his products. This is Gloria's third cycle in the communal bank, and she likes it because it is very easy to get the loans. \r\n\r\nShe gave the previous loan she received from Kiva to her husband, and with it he bought wood and other materials. Thanks to God, her husband has had plenty of work in the shop, and this has given them a very good income. With it, they have improved their economic and family stability. Regarding repayments, she was once late because one of her children was sick, but then she paid off everything.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to give the best to her children.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":360,"image":{"id":861739,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture Making","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"to purchase nails, glue, shellac, wood, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Montecristi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2012-01-08T18:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gloria Mar\u00eda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":880,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":88},{"due_date":"2012-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":88},{"due_date":"2012-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":88},{"due_date":"2012-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":88},{"due_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":88},{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":88},{"due_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":88},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":88},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88},{"due_date":"2012-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":88}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":180,"local_amount":176,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:18:07Z","rounded_local_amount":180,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257183308,"comment":null},{"amount":180,"local_amount":176,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:30:09Z","rounded_local_amount":180,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263318965,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-10T14:09:10Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":378494,"name":"Flor Mar\u00eda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Banco Comunal Mar\u00eda Auxiliadora se re\u00fane en La parroquia Sequita en Montecristi prospero cant\u00f3n manabita, lleno de gente trabajadora dedicada y orgullosa de sus ra\u00edces, La Sequita es una parroquia donde sus habitantes son gente honesta que solo saben trabajar y dedicarse a sus familias.\n\nEn este lugar conocimos a la  se\u00f1ora Flor.
