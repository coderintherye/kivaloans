is from the village of Taboc Norte, Oroquieta City. She is 39 years old, married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Arlyn runs a business selling fish.  Arlyn has been engaged in her business for 2 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities. Arlyn joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell.\r\n\r\nArlyn is requesting a new loan of 7000 PHP with which she will purchase additional inventory and use some for working capital. This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Arlyn from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model. \r\n\r\nNote: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":719743,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish

los distritos m\u00e1s poblados de la regi\u00f3n Lambayeque, caracterizado principalmente por tener altos \u00edndices de pobreza, ya que las personas viven generalmente en zona urbana marginal que carecen de servicios b\u00e1sicos.\n\nDesde hace cinco a\u00f1os tiene instalado en el segundo sector del mercado de abastos de Moshoqueque un puesto de venta de verduras. Todos los d\u00edas ofrece a sus clientes una variedad de legumbres y tub\u00e9rculos frescos los cuales adquiere em el mercado mayorista de la ciudad de Chiclayo. Este negocio es una fuente importante de ayuda a la familia, ya que lo que su esposo gana como alba\u00f1il no es suficiente para solventar los gastos familiares. El negocio de Maruja siempre cuenta con clientes que prefieren su buen trato y amabilidad. \n\nElla desea adquirir m\u00e1s mercader\u00eda por lotes para que disminuya sus costos y le permita incrementar su nivel de ventas. Por ello h\u00e1 cre\u00eddo conveniente solicitar a Edpyme Alternativa un cr\u00e9dito de 1000 nuevos soles. \n\nMaruja es una mujer bastante trabajadora y entregada a su familia. Su mayor anhelo es seguir creciendo como empresaria mejorando su calidad de vida.\n\n","en":"Maruja is 39 years old, married, and lives with her husband and two children in the Jos\u00e9 Leonardo Ortiz district, one of the most densely populated districts of the Lambayeque region.  It is noted primarily for its high poverty index since people generally live in marginal urban areas that lack basic services.\r\n<p>\r\nFor the past five years, she has had a vegetable stand set up in the second section of the Moshoqueque wholesale food market.  Every day, she offers her customers a variety of fresh vegetables and tubers which she gets from the wholesale market in the city of Chiclayo.  This business is an important source of income for her family since her husband\u2019s earnings as a builder are not enough to cover the family expenses.

She is a very cheerful and kind woman who lives in her own home with her husband, 67 year-old Alberto, who is retired, and 3 of her 6 children.  All of her children are grown up and live independently.\r\n\r\nFor two years, Irma has been selling underwear and socks for all ages.  She carries out her business with the help of her daughters who sell to their friends which means that she doesn't have to spend so much time on her business.  In order to stock up on merchandise, she visits the commercial centers in the middle of Lima where she buys her goods wholesale for very reasonable prices and then sells them at a reasonable price.  This means that she makes good profits in her business.\r\n\r\nOver the two years in which she has been making these sales, Irma has felt very satisfied with her business since she sells independently.  She is sure that if she continues to work with the same amount of energy, she will manage to expand her business.  For this reason, she is keen to have a wider variety of clothes for all ages and all different brands of socks in order to energize her business some more and thereby, in the future, continue building her home.\r\n\r\nThis is Irma's ninth loan with MFP and over the years she has felt very obliged to her community bank and MFP for the help that they have given her.  For this reason, she says that she \"does not wish to let down those who have placed their trust in her\".  Irma is planning to spend her loan on increasing her stock of underwear in general in order to continue working.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":729780,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to stock up with underwear in order to meet her customers' demands","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-03-15T11:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Irma ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":219.97},{"due_date":"2011-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":234.46},{"due_date":"2011-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":243.42},{"due_date":"2011-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":255.97},{"due_date":"2011-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":266.65},{"due_date":"2011-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":279.53}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.66},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.96},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.26},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.85},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.78},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.49}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":80.66,"local_amount":219.97,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:32:11Z","rounded_local_amount":223.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206196365,"comment":null},{"amount":85.96,"local_amount":234.46,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:42:15Z","rounded_local_amount":238.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211270046,"comment":null},{"amount":89.26,"local_amount":243.42,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:33:27Z","rounded_local_amount":247.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216550065,"comment":null},{"amount":93.85,"local_amount":255.97,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:14:03Z","rounded_local_amount":259.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221718739,"comment":null},{"amount":97.78,"local_amount":266.65,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:14:23Z","rounded_local_amount":270.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350193,"comment":null},{"amount":102.49,"local_amount":279.53,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:47:41Z","rounded_local_amount":283.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232850681,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-03-17T02:28:46Z","paid_date":"2011-10-15T09:47:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":281224,"name":"Santigie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is 39-year-old Santigie K..

She operates a business making and selling baked goods: pies, alfajores, cakes, chocolates, cookies, etc.  Maria has operated the business for 3 years and she works to order.  She knows her customers and they know her.  They come to her house to order whatever baked goods they need.  She has steadily added customers over the years as her reputation for making quality products has grown.  Maria buys her supplies at retail supermarkets because the prices are better.  She will use this loan from Fondo Esperanza, plus her own savings, to buy construction materials for adding a space to her house where she can set up a shop.  Her house is near a school so she thinks building the shop there will help her business.  She hopes to attract new customers, as well.  To complete the project, she needs a permit to set up a home-based store.  Maria lives with her 2 children, 11- and 7-years old, respectively.  She wants to set up the bakery so that she can provide her children with a good education and a better life.  Fondo Esperanza has been a great help to Maria's business because she has learned how to better spend her money and the loans that she's received from the bank have helped her to increase her income.  She also enjoys the regular meetings that Fondo Esperanza arranges with other members of the bank.  Curico is a town in Maule, a region of central Chile.  The area has a Mediterranean climate and is considered to be among the most pleasant in the country.  It's also know for its wines and its natural beauty.  According to the latest census figures, the area is also one of the poorest in Chile despite a growing workforce."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":719472,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"Construction materials for food business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CL","country":"Chile","town":"Curic\u00f3","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-30 -71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":157,"posted_date":"2011-03-11T20:06:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CLP","disbursal_amount":304886,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":14173},{"due_date":"2011-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":16235},{"due_date":"2011-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":16340},{"due_date":"2011-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":16446},{"due_date":"2011-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":16552},{"due_date":"2011-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":16659},{"due_date":"2011-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":16767},{"due_date":"2011-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":16875},{"due_date":"2011-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":16984},{"due_date":"2011-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":17094},{"due_date":"2011-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":17204},{"due_date":"2011-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":17315},{"due_date":"2011-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":17427},{"due_date":"2011-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":17540},{"due_date":"2011-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":17653},{"due_date":"2011-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":17767},{"due_date":"2011-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":17849},{"due_date":"2011-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":18006}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.22},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.61},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.83},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.07},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.28},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.52},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.75},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.97},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.21},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.45},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.92},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.15},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.4},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.63},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.88},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.05},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.39}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":134.73,"local_amount":63194,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:59:47Z","rounded_local_amount":64904.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201282265,"comment":null},{"amount":142.52,"local_amount":66853,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:56:35Z","rounded_local_amount":68662.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206150272,"comment":null},{"amount":183.4,"local_amount":86024,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:11:09Z","rounded_local_amount":88352.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211223355,"comment":null},{"amount":150.96,"local_amount":70809,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:02:57Z","rounded_local_amount":72725.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216502329,"comment":null},{"amount":38.39,"local_amount":18006,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T09:06:09Z","rounded_local_amount":18493.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227035335,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-03-12T21:38:04Z","paid_date":"2011-09-15T09:06:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":281256,"name":"Mar\u00eda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda forma parte del Banco comunal \u201cLuz de esperanza\u201d perteneciente a la ciudad de Curic\u00f3.

is 27-year-old accomplished and hardworking young woman from Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia.  She lives in a small house in the suburbia with her husband and two kids. Her husband works at furniture manufacturing company and daughter goes to a kindergarten while her son attends local public school. \r\n\r\nShe started running a clothing retail stall at Narantuul, the largest outdoor market in Mongolia, in 2006 with 200,000 Mongolian Tugriks (MNT) in her working capital. At the beginning stages of her business, she rented a stall at Narantuul from another person who had a rental contract with Narantuul. This was an unstable business situation for her because the middleman could dismiss her at any time. At this time her stall had 1 million MNT in working capital. Usually, it is very difficult to obtain a rental contract with Narantuul because the stalls are in such high demand.\r\nHowever, in 2007, Ms. Odgerel had the opportunity to sign a rental contract directly with Narantuul in order to make her business more stable. As a result of her hard work, today she has 2,500,000 MNT in her working capital. Besides that, with the profit of her business, she managed to build new small house for living and bought two yards to extend. Moreover, she has just bought a car, which is used for couple years, which has become essential need for her family. \r\n\r\nAltantuya is requesting a loan of 1,500,000 MNT. With this loan, she wants to import more clothes for spring from Beijing, China. Her long term objective is to buy an apartment where her family can have a better living condition. Altantuya and her husband are trying their best to achieve their goals.

Oscar has been working the land for the past two years, an inheritance given to his wife by his father-in-law. He is thankful to Afodenic (Kiva Field Partner) for providing him the support to continue work at a pineapple plantation.  The pineapples use to produce small reddish fruits. This time it will be different because thanks to the care and agricultural assessment he managed to have pineapple sprouts and he is now able to plant more.

At the age of 50, Paciencia Pisuana is committed to re-learning many things in her life. She only attained a high school education, but she makes sure she understands and applies every lesson she receives from CCT* as a community partner. Paciencia and her husband Ferdinand, who is employed as a chauffeur, live in Dasmarinas, Cavite, where they have raised four children. One of their children stays at home, one is employed, one is in enrolled in high school, and the youngest  is in elementary school.\r\n \r\nPaciencia is a determined entrepreneur. She patiently manages her own little sari-sari (variety) store daily, which is situated near their home. Here she sells instant noodles, sachets of shampoo, and detergent, as well as soft drinks, which serve as a popular thirst quencher in the hot weather. She also runs a carinderia (small eatery), where she cooks meals for busy working people. In addition, she sells mineral water as an additional source of income. Together, these micro-entrepreneurial efforts enable her to earn Php 10,000 per month.\r\n\r\nTo help her improve her primary business, she is applying for a Php 9,000 loan. She will use this to replenish the stock of products she offers in her store. She knows she has to do this in order to offer her regular customers fresher options and encourage them to patronize her store. With additional money on hand and with a commitment to continuous learning, Paciencia is positive that she will become more profitable with her business.\r\n\r\nAs with any other entrepreneur, it is Pacienca's dream to make her sari-sari store grow. She aims to earn more in order to be able to save more and to level up her business.

Nelson G., age 45 and unmarried, is willing to take on that goal even as he lives out the spirit of entrepreneurship. Nelson reached college level in his education and is now pursuing his own business. One way in in which he helps is offering financial support to a family member. He has lived in Silang, Cavite, for five years. During that time, Nelson has operated a pig raising business and a farm. He is adept at raising healthy pigs to offer for for sale and has a true green thumb when it comes to producing quality crops. He is well aware of the techniques and the seasons involving these agricultural small-scale businesses, and this level of experience allows him to earn Php 6,000 every month. Nelson employs one person to help him with the routine tasks of the business.\r\n\r\nTo help him grow his business, he is applying for a Php 40,000 loan. He will purchase pig feed and fertilizer for his farm with this money. Also, he plans to take measures to maintain the condition of his farm. His business requires real effort, and the loan will be a great help toward sustaining his business.\r\n\r\nThe decrease in the production of piglets in his piggery has recently greatly affected his business. But rather than focusing on his loss, Nelson aspires toward raising thirty productive sows in a set span of time. Greater than this business goal is his overarching aim of being able to serve the Lord in whatever he does, which leads eventually to serving others for His name\u2019s sake. Nelson also dreams of going abroad to work someday.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She is 46 years old. Yolly is the group leader of a 9-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nYolly is married and has 4 school-aged children. She owns & operates a business, preparing and selling cooked food for daily meals. Yolly has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Yolly joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. She is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and provide working capital. This will be her 2nd loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fishermen and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":727582,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Here she makes her home with her husband and three children in a simple structure comprised of wooden walls and a tin roof.\r\n\r\nAna originally came to Esperanza over six loans ago for the purpose of improving her business and she has proved herself very successful as an associate of Esperanza, repaying on time every time. She will use this new loan to invest in her coconut sales by buying some coconut trees (This is the best deal for the people selling coconuts. They buy the tree ready to harvest.) She plans to use the profits to purchase as many things as she can supply for her family and to continue to improve her home. Additionally, in the long term, she would like to save money for a vehicle to move her products and to continue to increase her savings. She would like to thank you all for your support.\r\n\r\nThere are two photos because we want to show as many faces as possible.

Several years ago she was in a relationship and now has five adult children. Her youngest daughter lives in Rosa's house with Rosa's little six-year-old grandson.\r\n\r\nShe has a beauty salon where she has a lot of business, but she also makes sales. She sells products by catalog from Oriflame (beauty products, cosmetics, perfumes and accessories for ladies), and lingerie from Leonisa, but what she sells most is Belesa brand Brazilian jewelry. Rosa works everyday, making sales in her shop. She sells both retail and wholesale because she delivers the jewelry to other people so they can sell it. Rosa extends credit to these people on either a two-week or monthly basis. She buys the jewelry in Guayaquil, and the other merchandise is delivered to her shop.

She earns her living by operating a general store and a fishing\/fish vending businesses. Her husband Jonathan, who is 30 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have two children who are 2 and 5 years old. Marie Fe joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past eight loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Marie Fe has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow.

Marieta joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2003 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 15 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Marieta has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 24,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 16th loan, she is borrowing PHP 25,000 to buy stock for the general store so that she can continue to save up for the future expansion of her business.

lives in a small city of Punjab, Pakistan, called Kasur. Kasur is famous for its tanneries industry. She has been living there in a single-room brick house with her family for the past three years. She is 33 years old, married to M. A., and has five children. Only two of them are able to get an education due to the financial constraints of Sabran and her husband. \r\n\r\nBoth Sabran and her husband make and sell sweaters. They prepare them through thread machines and sell to different shops. Sabran also carries out her responsibilities of a housewife very well.

She lives in Lapu-lapu, Cebu. Roqueta joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 13 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Roqueta has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow.

lives in a small city in Punjab, Pakistan called Kasur. Kasur is famous for its tannery industry. She has been living there in a three room brick house with her family for past seven years. Azran is 51 years old, married to S. A. and has four sons. Her three eldest sons have a power loom business while the youngest stays at home. Azran is unable to provide them with an education due to financial constraints. \r\n\r\nAzran and her husband are involved in a used clothing (sweaters) selling business. S. A. has good business contacts in the market and he sells a good number of sweaters every month for handsome profits. Azran is also a very good housewife and fulfills her responsibilities as a mother and wife very well.

Zisa Belen is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase hair pins, combs, celphone accessories, bracelets and other products for sale.
