With her mother she manages a business for selling and distribution of poultry and sausage in the city market. Her mother started the business 6 years ago but fell ill suddenly and so the business must be operated out of the city of Lima. Genesis saw the need to start administering the business for the last 6 months and during this time has worked to keep it going. \r\n\r\nShe receives the chicken meat early and distributes it to small stores in the outskirts of the city. Then she returns to the business office and begins to offer her merchandise at retail to her regular customers. Genesis tells us that this season the demand from her customers has grown and so for the first time she is asking for a loan of 800 PNS from Edpyme Alternativa to grow her business. \r\n\r\nShe wants to continue growing as an entrepreneur and also to study a technical career to ensure a better future for her child. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Machelle Wilson, Kiva

She has steady demand from her neighbors for her products, so for the first time she has decided to request a loan from Edpyme Alternativa for 1000 soles so that she can buy more products and expand her business. \r\n\r\nThis business is her family's main source of income, so Sabina is always trying to grow it.

He lives with his wife and their three sons, who are 18, 15 and 10 years old, in the Pasabar La Granja neighborhood of Olmos District, two hours north of the city of Chiclayo. \r\n\r\nDuring the day, he works as an agricultural laborer, but this is not steady work, so three years ago he decided he needed to open a small grocery store within his home, which his wife now runs. They offer their neighbors basic goods like rice, sugar and oil, as well as other dry goods and drinks.\r\n\r\nHis store is currently depleted of merchandise because of his neighbors' constant high demand. This is why he is requesting his first loan from Edpyme Alternativa: a loan of 1000 soles which he will use to buy more products and expand his business. \r\n\r\nHe tells us that because of the difficult economic circumstances he faces, he hasn't been able to give his children the opportunity to pursue higher education. His two older children work to help support the family, while his youngest son is studying at a local school. \r\n\r\nHis greatest dream is to expand his business and save up enough to provide his children with the education they need in order to to ensure a stable future. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Cynthia McMurry, Kiva

They work together at Rosa's small restaurant, where she sells breakfast and lunch. Her sales have been slow lately, and she sometimes has to waste food when she can't sell it; she struggles each day to improve her economic situation. She lives in a neighborhood called South Waspan in the Nicaraguan capital city of Managua. Her goal is to finish the home improvements she has been making, little by little. She hasn't been able to do all of the construction at once because it would be very expensive. \r\n\r\nShe has been with Afodenic for three loan cycles now, and in this loan cycle she plans to buy meat, chicken, vegetables, fruits, basic grains, sodas, and other items to improve service at her restaurant and boost sales. She has already invested a lot of money in her business, and since she allows her clients to pay on credit, she needs the money up front in order to make this investment. She is grateful to Afodenic for the benefits she has obtained through loans; she has been able to make improvements to her business and in her personal life, and she is now better able to satisfy her own personal needs. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Cynthia McMurry, Kiva

She is married and has two children who are 12 and 13 years old and are currently studying in pursuit of a better future. Her husband works as a taxi driver, and finds the work tiring because sometimes his routes don't pay well due to the economic crisis the country is currently facing. People prefer to pay 2.50 c\u00f3rdobas - what a ride costs in the city of Managua - and don't want to pay taxi rides that cost 40 c\u00f3rdobas, since that is the money they need to buy food each day. \r\n\r\nYadira has been selling clothing and shoes for the past 5 years, and she often has low sales. She makes most of her sales on payday, and this way she makes up for the rest of the month. She started taking out loans through a village bank, and thus was able to invest in her business. With this loan, she will buy a variety of clothing for men, women and children to satisfy her clients' demand, since November and the Christmas season are her best times for sales. She hopes to earn good profits so that she can continue to invest in her business. She is grateful to Afodenic for giving her this opportunity to take out a loan. \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Cynthia McMurry, Kiva

Each person has invested the loans they have received throughout the years in their businesses, though with different objectives. Rosa B., for example, is the mother of two children who are 10 and 3 years old. Four years ago, she started a food cart business with money her husband gave her. She started this business because of economic hardship; the money her husband earned was not enough for household needs. \nAt the beginning, Rosa would take out on credit the supplies she needed, and at the end of the day, she would pay the store back with what she earned selling \"cachangas\" (large flat bread), coffee, and fried chicken. Rosa's efforts, her nice manner, and her desire to succeed led to more customers.\nWith the loans she received, she has bought plates, cups, silverware, benches, and a tent. This business has helped Rosa a lot, since it has allowed her to buy shoes, clothes and school supplies for her little ones, and to pay for basic household needs. \nShe needs the new loan because she wants to buy a kitchen table and to repair the tent, which has deteriorated after much use.\n\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Violeta Rubiani, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3850,"image":{"id":417264,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Repairing\/supplying business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:57Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3850,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa Elvira ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gregoria Nicolasa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Romulo Jorge ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmen Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jessenia Mariela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marcelina Elifia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fortunata Marcela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa Elvira ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mery Luz ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosario Consuelo ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":11200,"loan_amount":3850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":2800},{"due_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":2800},{"due_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":2800},{"due_date":"2010-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":2800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":962.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":962.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":962.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":962.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":962.5,"local_amount":2800,"processed_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:11:43Z","rounded_local_amount":2800.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103780219,"comment":null},{"amount":962.5,"local_amount":2800,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T12:46:24Z","rounded_local_amount":2800.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110669092,"comment":null},{"amount":962.5,"local_amount":2800,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:15:30Z","rounded_local_amount":2800.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118064551,"comment":null},{"amount":962.5,"local_amount":2800,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:46:32Z","rounded_local_amount":2800.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123899611,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-11-29T23:42:29Z","paid_date":"2010-03-15T09:46:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":148880,"name":"Carmela","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"49-year-old Carmela A. has a barbecue business in Dauis, Panglao, that she started in May 2006.

Because of this, the family was experiencing a financial crisis.\r\n\r\nTo help her husband in raising their five children, Erlinda decided to engage in business. She opened up a little sari-sari (variety) store in her home. For twenty-three years she has been able to sustain the business and is able to help in supporting her family. Now she is earning an average net income of not less than P3,000, which is so helpful for their family income.\r\n\r\nAs a new member of Honeybee Center under the PDP-LP (Paglaum Development Program

She lives in a small house with her two sons, Wilson (age 22) and Gerber (age 20), who are the reason behind all her efforts.\r\n<p>\r\nNarcissa has been raising cattle in order to forge a decent life for herself.

For 30 years, Narcissa has been at her job and says the most difficult part for her is transporting her animals to market because it demands much time and effort.

She lives in her own home with her 3 children: Roxanne, 17, Freddy, 14 and Jhon who is 12 years old. What she wants most is to give them a good education.\r\n\r\nThe love and affection with which Ysabel cares for her livestock has made her animals grow big and strong, which is why when she brings them to the market to sell at the fairs, they are in high demand and quickly purchased. From very early on, she lets them graze and is always making sure the food they eat is healthy.\r\n\r\nWhat she likes best about her job is to walk through the vast fields with her livestock. She has spent 20 years in this trade and believes that the most difficult part of her job is to bring their cattle to the fairs where they are sold. Over time, she hopes to increase the number of cattle that she has but knows she has to work hard and is willing to do so.\r\n\r\nThis is the second loan with MFP for Ysabel.

But unfortunately her husband died. But her life and business continues, and is also a source of leisure for her to forget what happened to her husband. When she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon her businesses brought more comfort to the family because it doubled her earnings to sustain her children.

While in business, one may encounter problems, but these also were overcome and as a result helped to make Evelyntina strong. In 2001, she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon for the purpose of expanding her business and to have access to capital. She expanded her business by adding a pig fattening business as an additional source of income. In every month she was able to earn Php 8,000. This amount was used to defray household expenses, and build savings. She maintains her good credit performance because of the continuing income of her business.\r\n\r\nPreviously she borrowed Php 19,500 for her general store and pig fattening. The said loan was fully paid on time. Now she is borrowing the same amount of Php 19,500 as additional capital for her 18th loan cycle. The income from this loan will be used for the expansion of her business and support the daily family expenses.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just a few, but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":417335,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"Additional Capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Valladolid, Negros Occidental","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":145,"posted_date":"2009-11-01T07:01:00Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Evelyntina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":19500,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":780}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":136,"local_amount":6240,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:08:46Z","rounded_local_amount":6487.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103848995,"comment":null},{"amount":85,"local_amount":3900,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:00:27Z","rounded_local_amount":4054.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110739663,"comment":null},{"amount":68,"local_amount":3120,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:14:50Z","rounded_local_amount":3243.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118129083,"comment":null},{"amount":68,"local_amount":3120,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:53:59Z","rounded_local_amount":3243.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123965880,"comment":null},{"amount":68,"local_amount":3120,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:37:33Z","rounded_local_amount":3243.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128997794,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-11-06T03:00:14Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T09:37:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":148930,"name":"Brayan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Brayan B. is from the village of Lawis Panalsalan.

Beth moved to Gatundu, her current home town, due to post-election clashes which occurred in Kenya in 2007\/2008. Her family lost everything they had invested but decided to move on with life. Her family members gave her a small amount of capital to start a business. Beth had been a teacher for fourteen years before deciding to venture into business making teaching-aid graphics for kindergarten.\r\n\r\nBeth has been operating an art-class business for the past twelve years. She plans to expand her business and buy more materials with the loan she receives: i.e. plywood, paints and sealing papers.\r\n\r\nBeth was introduced to Kiva partner KADET through an existing KADET client. She is applying for her first loan with KADET. With the extra profits, Beth intends to buy a piece of land and build a residential house.\r\n\r\nBeth\u2019s hopes and dreams are to open her own teaching-aid-graphics manufacturing company and to create job opportunities for the people in her community. She describes herself as an industrious lady, very innovative, and hardworking.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout KADET:\r\nThe Kenya Agency for the Development of Enterprise and Technology (KADET) is dedicated to economically empowering its clients by providing financial services to improve the living conditions of micro-entrepreneurs and their children across Kenya.

They provide a variety of clothing items to satisfy their customers' needs and transport and sell coal during the wintertime.

is married to Wanjiku and they have five children: Miriam, Elizabeth, Lela, Mwangi and Kimathi. They are 18, 14, 12, 9 and 2 years old, respectively.\r\n\r\nSyuki was introduced to KADET through existing clients and he is servicing his second loan. He has no bad credit history. His main source of income is rental houses although he also has a retail and green grocery shop. \r\n\r\nSyuki intends to use this loan to renovate his rental houses. He wants to change out the iron sheet walls and plaster the floor. All his businesses are situated in a slum within the industrial area, and the slum dwellers are his customers and tenants.\r\n\r\nWith the extra profits, he plans to educate his children. His hopes are to build other rental houses.

She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 13,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale.\n\nMa. Verly is requesting a new loan of 14,500 PHP which will be used to purchase some baking equipment. This loan will be her 4th from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of her family. \n\n\nAbout PMPC:\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\n\n\n *Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

These are words of encouragement from Emily, a resident of Vista Alegre, Bayombong, Nueva Vizcaya.  She is 49 years-old, married, and blessed with four children who are all studying. Emily and her husband wanted their children to finish their studies, and this has been their motivation to work hard in order to provide for their children's educational needs. \r\n<p>\r\nHer husband manages their farm where most of their crops are rice and vegetables. To support her husband financially, Emily set up her own business which is a sari-sari store (community based store) in their village. She is glad that she can earn a monthly income of PHP4,000.00 which she budgets to meet their daily needs and tuition fees and allowances of their children. \r\n<p>\r\nShe is now asking to borrow PHP17,000 from the KIVA lenders. She will use the loan to buy more grocery items and other commodities which are commonly needed in their village. She believes that with this financial assistance she can improve her small sari-sari store and support the schooling of her children.

He is 50 years old and married to Ellen.  They are blessed with three children, one male and two females. They aim to give their children a better future by providing them with the best education possible. \r\n\r\nDue to hardships and difficulties, his wife chose to work abroad in Singapore, while Potenciano manages their small sari-sari store (community based store) in their village.  He also farms and repairs appliances. Through his patience and sacrifices, he is able to earn a net income of PHP3,000.00 which is used for the family's basic daily needs.

Petronila has been a farmer for the past 25 years.  She learned her farming skills from her parents who, as life-long farmers, taught her to work the land.  The greatest difficulty she has faced lately is the smoke from the volcano which has burned much of her crop causing her yields to be so poor that she hasn't even recouped her investment.  She is happy for Afodenic's help in purchasing fertilizers which will insure a better crop yield and products that she can sell for a better price.

Le gusta los prestamos de FUDECOSUR por que hay menos requisitos. \u00e9l desea brindar a su famil\u00eda e hijos un futuro mejor y estable. Tambien ella quiere mas vaccas algun dia.

Zeidy has two hectares of unused grazing land and would like to start raising cattle.  She wants to buy a cow and asked FUDECOSUR for a loan.  This is her first loan from FUDECOSUR and she believes that she can make her fields grow with it.  She likes FUDECOSUR's loans because they have fewer requirements.  She wishes to offer her family and children a better and more stable future.  She would also like to own more cows someday. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":417913,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy a cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Colorado","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":150,"posted_date":"2009-10-30T23:30:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zeidy ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":360000,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":120000},{"due_date":"2011-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":120000},{"due_date":"2012-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":120000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":208.34},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":208.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":208.33,"local_amount":120000,"processed_date":"2010-10-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:51:59Z","rounded_local_amount":120093.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177404511,"comment":null},{"amount":208.33,"local_amount":120000,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-29T09:13:26Z","rounded_local_amount":120093.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196117260,"comment":null},{"amount":208.34,"local_amount":120000,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:50:41Z","rounded_local_amount":120093.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244561609,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-10-31T15:27:53Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T09:50:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":149196,"name":"Las Palomitas Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Maritza del Carmen C. de 38 a\u00f1os es la coordinadora del grupo Las Palomitas.

All of her children, except one daughter, are married and live in their own houses nearby.  Maria has a small grocery store that she would like to see grow.  She sells all kinds of foodstuffs but would like to diversify so has asked for a loan from FUDECOSUR.  This is her third FUDECOSUR loan and she believes it will help her business grow.  She likes FUDECOSUR's loans because she has had loans with the National Bank of Costa Rica and they have too many requirements.  She is also a member of the FUDECOSUR committee so she is more trustful of FUDECOSUR than of traditional banks.  She hopes to provide her family with a better and more stable future.

This is the case of:\r\nMagali R. I., 39, who is currently the treasurer of the \u201cSan Mart\u00edn de Porres\u201d communal bank.  Although her husband is the main provider, Magali decided to prepare catered meals to help her husband.  She offered her meals to city workers and to UGEL (local school).  Profits from these meals grew and she needed to invest in supplies like a sack of rice, a sack of sugar and utensils.  Thus, she began her participation in EDAPROSPO \u2013 PROSPERIDAD's loan program.  She used the profits from her business for her eldest son's educational expenses (materials and travel costs) since he is studying industrial\/architectural design at a state university.  Magali took some crafts workshops at CEO \u201cSan Juan Bautista\u201d last year and created some items.  She had to stop selling meals because sales declined.  She requests this loan to buy supplies to make Christmas decorations and dolls.  These supplies would include such things as:  decorative ribbons, wreaths, decorations, \"cola de rata\" (rat's tail, a type of colored ribbon) in various colors, silicone, Santa and Mrs. Claus faces, and \"napa\" (stuffing for the dolls).

Matucana Communal Bank consists of ten people who have been working with EDAPROSPO-PROSPERIDAD for more than 2\u00bd years.  The loans they have received were invested into their businesses.  As a result, the income they generate help pay for their household expenses and improve their quality of life.\r\n<p>\r\nTake the example of Sarela M. E..  She tells us that she raises animals (ducks, turkeys, and rabbits) out of her home.  Most of the animals are sold, but some are set asiD. to feed her family.  She also has a llama that serves as the family pet.  Sarela is married and has one child.\r\n<p>\r\nIt all started one day when she brought home a guinea pig for her mother to prepare as a meal, but she did not know at the time she purchased it that it was pregnant.  She eventually found out about it in time and was able to earn an income from the offspring.  Sarela acquired a male guinea pig so that she could continue the momentum of her new business.  She needed additional capital to buy food (grasses and feed for fattening) for the animals, so she applied for a loan so that she could keep her business running.  At one point, she had as many as 150 guinea pigs, which was too much to handle.  Sarela was able to sell all of the animals and use the capital to purchase a motorcycle taxi, from which she continues to receive rental income to this day.  \r\n<p>\r\nSarela and her husband are considering starting another business since he does not have a stable job at the moment.  She continues to be the primary support for covering her family\u2019s expenses.  Sarela is requesting a loan to purchase trousers, jackets, and comforters.  She plans to sell these items to friends and acquaintances for the winter season.   \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

Q. and her husband, Lorenzo, are engaged in the fishing business in their small village in Tabao, Zone 2, Valladolid, Negros Occidental, in the Philippines.  \r\n\r\nThey started off in this business without owning a fishing boat, even a small one, as they had no money to purchase one.  Their recourse then was to hitch a ride with other fishermen in their boats, fish and sell the fish to the local community. However, with a lot of hard work and a desire to improve not only their quality of life but also the education of their three children, Amera joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1999 and slowly they were able to improve their business. They were able to buy their own fishing boat, purchase more nets, venture into catching crabs, and now they are able to sell these not only in the local community but also to businessmen, who sell their crabs and some fish in the big cities, getting them more margin on their catch.\r\n\r\nNow on her 13th loan cycle with NWTF-Project Dungganon, Amera earns between P6-16,000 a month from the business, which helps a lot in providing for their household expenses and sending her three children to school, and even allowing them to expand their fishing business. For her next loan, Amera needs P19,500 to purchase materials to build more nets to catch bigger crabs. At the same time she will use some of the money for additional working capital for the business, which will allow them to increase their catch and hopefully, save more money in the hopes of adding a few fishing boats to their fleet in the near future.\r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life which can be called honorable.

This is her second Kiva loan, and she is thankful to all Kiva lenders who helped her reach her goals. Maktym is 32 years old. Her husband had to go to Russia for seasonal work. Now Maktym lives with four children and provides for them while her husband is abroad. Her elder son is ten years old, and her youngest daughter is just two years old. Maktym manages to combine work and childcare. In order to provide for her family, Maktym sells children's clothing (pajamas, jackets, underwear). She got involved in this business after she and her husband moved from their village to the city. A neighbor, having seen Maktym's situation, recommended her to go into sales. Maktym quickly became an independent entrepreneur. Maktym also purchased furniture, home appliances and a container. Now, having her own container, she has more freedom to manage her money and is more ready to risk. Maktym is lucky because her niece helps her around. Maktym's monthly income is 465 USD. Considering the fact that she invested only 116 USD in the beginning, her success is obvious. Now she needs another loan for buying winter clothing for sale. Maktym hopes that this business will help her realize her dreams: to buy a large house, a car, and to open a store. \r\n  \r\nMaktym has three group partners: Lira, Muktarali and Ashirhan. \r\n\r\nLira is a 36-year-old mother of six. Her husband is a driver. Lira sells women's clothing. In the past, she used to sell socks in Bishkek, but then, following the advice of her sister, she switched to clothes. Lira's monthly income is 350 USD. She is applying for a loan to buy winter clothes for sale.\r\n\r\nMuktarali is a 43-year-old father of three. He sells children's clothes, and his wife is a homemaker. Muktarali's business helps satisfy the family's needs. While their eldest daughter helps sell goods, the two other children are in school. Muktarali hopes to use the loan for the winter clothing.\r\n\r\nAshirhan is a 60-year-old mother of eight. Apart from two daughters, all her children have left the parents' home and live with their own families. In spite of her age, Ashirhan is actively engaged in trade: she sells national clothing, etc. Thanks to her work Ashirhan bought three houses for her sons. Now she needs a loan to purchase goods for sale. \r\n  \r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

Having reached the age of 58, Apal can surely consider herself a happy woman as she has raised five children. All of them, except one son, already have their own families and live separately. Her eldest son is 40 and the youngest daughter is 24.\r\n<p>\r\nNevertheless, Apal and her husband have preferred a shed and a busy daily routine of looking after cattle rather than a comfortable living room where they could sing a lullaby to their grandchildren. Always used to hard work and the smell of cattle, Apal and her husband are still working. They keep their own household. They are occupied with livestock raising and milk sales. These have been the main source of their sustenance for forty years.\r\n<p>\r\nRaising cattle has allowed them to successfully bring up the children not depending on government allowances or benefits. Selling milk alone provides them with a monthly income of $40. Whenever meat is needed, they always have cattle available for their needs.\r\n<p>\r\nApal has applied for this loan and hopes that by means of this loan, she will be able to buy a milk cow and sell more milk. Her immediate plans are to conduct some repair work at home and see her son married. \r\n\r\nApal has three partners: Jenishai, Tolkunai and Burulkan.  Jenishai, 34, has three children. To provide for the family, her husband works as a carpenter. Jenisha, in her turn, trades in clothing. Jenishai learned to sell clothes from her sister. Now she has become an independent entrepreneur.  Jenishai needs a loan to purchase goods. \r\n\r\nTolkunai, 34, has three children. Tolkunai manufactures traditional items at her house and sells them in the capital. Her husband is a welder. Making national articles brings her $120.
