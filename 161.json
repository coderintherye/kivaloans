A., an enrolled nurse, retired from the Provincial General Hospital of Rift Valley in Kenya and decided to open a medical clinic. The Rapha Medical Clinic, which serves the Nakuru free-area, provides general outpatient services, family planning, immunizations, and maternity services to children and adults who usually live in the surrounding slums. <p>\r\n\r\nThe clinic is characterized as medium sized, with 4 rooms, each with 2 beds. Not all of the rooms are entirely complete, so Mellap is working to finish them. She employs 1 clinical officer, 1 nurse, 1 support staff, and 1 lab technician and says that the clinic has a moderate patient flow. Mellap would like to expand the clinic, adding another nurse and more beds. <p>\r\n\r\nMellap is requesting a loan of 90,000 Kenya Schillings (1,200 USD) in order to purchase more beds, mattresses, bed linens, complete construction on current rooms, and purchase a septic tank. <p>\r\n\r\nA widow since 2001, Mellap has 5 children, all of whom are working adults. One of her sons used to work with Mellap at the clinic but has since moved to another job. Now Mellap works with one of her daughters, who is a registered nurse. A dream of Mellap\u2019s is to have a big hospital, and with a growing maternity ward, she is beginning to see a start to the realization of her dream.

Eight years later, he saw a need for a local health facility, as at the time all medical facilities were located very far from his community. The Chebunyo Medical Clinic is a four-room facility that provides curative services, medical counseling, out patient care, pre and post-natal care, and family planning services to children and adults in the rural area.<p>\r\n\r\nCharles has recently been trained by the Kisumu Medical and Education Trust to provide post-abortion care to women who are suffering from having received poorly performed, illicit abortions. In order to provide the post abortion care services, Charles will need to purchase the appropriate medical instruments and a sterilizer. Charles is requesting a loan of 90,000 Kenya Schillings (1,200 USD) in order to buy these items, as well as to purchase a patient examination couch and improve his clinic with renovations that will add extra space to the facility. <p>\r\n\r\nIn the future, Charles would like to add a maternity ward to the clinic and grow into a small hospital.

The amount is being used to support the daily needs of their family and as revolving capital for her business. Part of her income is also used to purchase other needed supplies for their farm, which is managed by her husband. \r\n\r\nJuanita is planning to venture into the hog raising business for an alternative source of income.

B. is 50 years old.

He works hard in his fields, where he spends as much time as possible providing the necessary care, fertilizing his land and spraying to prevent diseases that might affect his yields. Toshmamad needs tools and fertilizers to continue his difficult work of tending his crops so that they can be taken to the capital city for sale.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, and Central Asian traditions. But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":241130,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchasing

Zafar promises to repay this loan in a timely manner, as well, and thanks all Kiva lenders for trusting and supporting him.\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road, the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and the birthplace of the great Persian poet Rudaki and the most famous Islamic philosopher Ibn Sina (Avicenna). The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, and Central Asian traditions. But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

M. sees herself as a calm, hardworking and responsible person. She began her business due to the need for an income additional to her husband\u2019s to cover the household expenses. They have a child who grows each day, as do their economical needs. She began some time ago selling different products and even had a homemade-food shop, which she had to close because of the increase in the shop\u2019s rent. So, one of her friends convinced her to sell clothes and offered to take her to places where she could buy clothes at good prices. She followed her friend\u2019s advice and began to sell clothes 12 years ago. Her sales went very well. She now has a fair number of clients. Muhabbat asks for 1500 Somoni ($450), which she will pay back in 10 months, to purchase seasonal garments. She wants to take advantage of the dates and have a more diverse variety of garments for her clients, which will allow her to increase her sales. \r\n\r\nMore information about Tajikistan and IMON International: \r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road, the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and the birthplace of the great Persian poet Rudaki and the most famous Islamic philosopher Ibn Sina (Avicenna). The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, and Central Asian traditions. But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History: \r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":241143,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"Purchasing children's clothing to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Istaravshan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.910833 69.006389","type":"point"}},"partner_id":100,"posted_date":"2009-01-14T23:00:46Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Muhabbat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":130.85},{"due_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":134.78},{"due_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":138.82},{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":142.98},{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":147.27},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":151.69},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":156.24},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":160.93},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":165.76},{"due_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":170.68}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":39.25},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40.43},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":41.65},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.89},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.18},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.51},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.28},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.73},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.21}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":79.69,"local_amount":265.63,"processed_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T13:12:11Z","rounded_local_amount":271.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10221133,"comment":null},{"amount":41.65,"local_amount":138.82,"processed_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T09:23:22Z","rounded_local_amount":141.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20410056,"comment":null},{"amount":42.89,"local_amount":142.98,"processed_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T19:37:05Z","rounded_local_amount":145.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27103078,"comment":null},{"amount":44.18,"local_amount":147.27,"processed_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T20:36:37Z","rounded_local_amount":150.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35997282,"comment":null},{"amount":45.51,"local_amount":151.69,"processed_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:09:13Z","rounded_local_amount":154.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44580056,"comment":null},{"amount":46.87,"local_amount":156.24,"processed_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T21:49:19Z","rounded_local_amount":159.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52973539,"comment":null},{"amount":48.27,"local_amount":160.93,"processed_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T15:24:14Z","rounded_local_amount":164.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63193362,"comment":null},{"amount":49.73,"local_amount":165.76,"processed_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T17:32:26Z","rounded_local_amount":169.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73621217,"comment":null},{"amount":51.21,"local_amount":170.68,"processed_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T20:56:04Z","rounded_local_amount":174.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87058984,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-01-15T18:33:16Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T20:56:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":80174,"name":"Maheshwori","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Maheshwori M. lives in Thecho, Lalitpur.

History of note includes: it was once a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; the birthplace of the great Persian poet Rudaki; and the birthplace of the most famous Islamic philosopher Ibn Sina (Avicenna). The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p> \r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients have a viable business proposition when they request a loan. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and IMON will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p> \r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients have a viable business proposition when they request a loan. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and IMON will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

A. A. is a 28-year old woman who lives in Rongo, Kenya, where she runs a poultry business. She raises the chickens at her residence and sells them from a chicken coop stand near the Rongo matatu stage. (Matatus are large vans that function as buses, so a matatu stage is similar to a bus station.)<p>\r\n\r\nOriginally, Christine raised poultry for domestic use, as food for her husband and herself.  When she discovered that there is a high demand in the area for poultry, Christine decided to make what was a side project into a major business. Christine employs one woman to help sell the chickens. Local restaurants are her main customers, though individual consumers are also strong buyers. <p>\r\n\r\nA large cock will sell for around 600 Schillings while a medium one will sell for 300. The poultry business is booming and Christine can barely keep up with demand, selling about 30 chickens in a day. She wants to be able to expand into a bigger business, with a bigger coop and more chickens. Christine is requesting a loan of $150 USD in order to expand her current chicken coop and purchase more poultry. It is cheaper to raise the animals rather than purchase them, so she wants to be sure to have enough chickens in order to be able to be selling a large amount, while still producing enough eggs to raise chicks from.

She also offers tailoring services under the same roof. It is the income from tailoring that enabled her to start her grocery business. She is very skilled at making traditional outfits for both gents and ladies from bitenge, bikoi, and bark cloth.\r\n\r\nDue to insufficient funds, Pauline lacks most of the essential commodities in her grocery shop. However, the loan is now helping her stock both soft drinks and alcohol. She is so excited to be able to replace the home-boiled drinking water that she used to sell to her customers cheaply with bottled mineral water that she buys in cartons from various beverage companies. \r\n\r\nMarried with four children between ages of 8 and 10, she works tirelessly to ensure that her children's needs are met. She hopes that, with a good turn of events, she will one day open a large wholesale shop offering a variety of fast-moving consumer goods to retailers. With enough savings, she will, no doubt, build a modern residence and ensure that her children get the best education.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":241186,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchase soft drinks and alcohol.

She became a member of the TYM Fund in 1998 in order to invest in raising pigs.  In the ten years since then, she and her family used the fund to start a restaurant.  This family business continues to develop and provide T. with a steady income.  In addition, her husband\u2019s wages contribute to the family earnings, so that they now have a very stable income of about 5,000,000 VND (294 USD) per month.  In the next round of lending, Mrs. Th\u00eam hopes to borrow 20,000,000 VND (1175 USD) to invest in further improvements in her restaurant.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by Robert Sides,

Currently she and her husband together run a business which provides services for weddings.  The demand for this type of service has been rising steadily in her community, so her business has become quite successful, and now provides her family with an income of 3,000,000 VND (180 USD) per month.  In the next lending cycle, she hopes to borrow 10,000,000 VND (600 USD) to invest in equipment for her wedding services business.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by Robert Sides, Kiva

N., 47, is married and lives with four of her children in Kampong Cham Province. She works as a farmer, making $1 US each day, while her husband also does some farming and works as construction worker, making about $3 US each day as well. The family is also supported by two of their children who work in the local garment factories. There are times though, and during the rainy season, the couple will both go fishing and work together by catching and selling the fish. The weather conditions have been difficult for farming in Cambodia this past year and inflation has also been out of control. These factors have played into a difficult economic year for many Cambodians. In light of these difficult times, Chhun is asking for a loan of $800 US to purchase a motorbike for her husband to commute to work. This will reduce the cost that her husband spends everyday on public transportation.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":241604,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To

C. is 34 years old and sells fruits in the Kampong Cham province. Her business has been around for about four years and she makes $6 US every day. Selling fruit has been a difficult business, as there is high inflation and weather conditions have not been conducive to a good growing season. Her husband, Chhun Bunthoeun, 43, is a construction worker building houses. On average, he makes $6 US a day. Mrs. Hay C. is asking for a loan of $1200 US to make two investments. She would like to both invest $700 US to buy construction tools for her husband, and also put $500 US into her own fruit business, increasing her stock of fruits to sell. She sees these investments as opportunities that will be able to increase her daily

hospital. Fotima has 4 children and a husband who works as a minibus taxi driver. \r\nFotima came to Microinvest to obtain a loan to purchase a car for her oldest son. Her son wants to work as a taxi driver in his free time, since during winter there is very high demand for transportation among residents. She thinks that  spending a large sum on a purchase is made much easier by access to loans. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Anna Brown, Kiva

He is in the livestock business. He purchases and sells livestock. He goes through this cycle every 2-3 months. Selling livestock doesn't provide him with a continuous flow of income. In the beginning, it is necessary to feed the livestock for a a few months so that it reaches its slaughter weight. After that, it is ready to be put up for sale. And only after that process, it is possible to obtain a profit after the sale of livestock. But since 3 months is a long time, Muzaffar also sells produce at the marketplace, which provides him with a constant flow of income. It is profitable for him to have two businesses, with which both his wife and older son help him out.  \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Vasilisa Budnikova, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":241747,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"For business expenssion","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Khujand","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.28 69.631667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":"2008-12-22T06:40:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Muzaffar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":4000,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":571.43},{"due_date":"2009-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":571.43},{"due_date":"2009-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":571.43},{"due_date":"2009-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":571.43},{"due_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":571.43},{"due_date":"2009-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":571.43},{"due_date":"2009-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":571.42}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":171.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":171.43,"local_amount":571.43,"processed_date":"2009-01-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-19T09:06:55Z","rounded_local_amount":583.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10229614,"comment":null},{"amount":171.43,"local_amount":571.43,"processed_date":"2009-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:19:22Z","rounded_local_amount":583.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20427128,"comment":null},{"amount":171.43,"local_amount":571.43,"processed_date":"2009-03-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:56:04Z","rounded_local_amount":583.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27120637,"comment":null},{"amount":171.42,"local_amount":571.43,"processed_date":"2009-04-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T22:09:30Z","rounded_local_amount":583.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36015756,"comment":null},{"amount":171.43,"local_amount":571.43,"processed_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:17:12Z","rounded_local_amount":583.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44599490,"comment":null},{"amount":171.43,"local_amount":571.43,"processed_date":"2009-06-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-30T07:42:05Z","rounded_local_amount":583.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52993933,"comment":null},{"amount":171.43,"local_amount":571.42,"processed_date":"2009-07-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-06T11:07:22Z","rounded_local_amount":583.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63215203,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-12-28T05:23:41Z","paid_date":"2009-10-06T11:07:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":80325,"name":"Grace","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Married with 4 children, 44-year-old N.

My husband's name is M. who is a fruit seller with 15 years of experience. He collects fruit from fruit markets and sells it by bicycle in public places and earns a profit. I am a mother of four kids: two sons and two daughters. My elder son is a carpenter and my younger son runs a grocery shop. My elder daughter reads in 5th standard and my younger daughter reads in 2nd standard. I keep myself busy sewing clothes. This work provides me with two benefits: first it helps me to earn income and second it keeps me busy. I save my income to pay the school fees of my daughters. My husband and my sons bear the house expenses. I successfully repaid my first loan which I took from Asasah (a microfinance institute of Pakistan). Now I am applying for a loan again to buy groceries to expand my younger son\u2019s grocery shop. \r\n\r\nI am a group leader of a few more women in my locality. Safia baji wants a loan to buy tea to resell. Sagheeran baji wants a loan to repair her vehicle named \u201cShahzore\u201d. Parveen akhtar baji and Naheed akhtar baji each want a loan to buy wood to resell. \r\n\r\nThis is a group loan. The loan funds will be distributed among the group members, each of whom will invest in her own business. The members mutually guarantee one another's loans. If one member does not repay, the other members are

Presently, the main sources of income for her family are farming and raising ducks, which provide them with earnings of about 2,000,000 VND (120 USD) per month.  In the next lending cycle, she hopes to borrow 15,000,000 VND (900 USD) to buy seedlings.  She will plant some of them and sell the rest to other farmers in her community.

Each month, in addition to her income from selling potted plants, she receives some support from her children, so her financial situation is slowly improving.

Thi Nhung is 55 years old. She has 4 children and 3 are grown. Before joining TYM fund, her family's economic situation was quite difficult. Her husband died at an early age while the children were still young. In 2004, she joined the fund to borrow money to invest in a grocery store. Presently, the store is her family's main source of income. She also has additional monthly help from her grown children who also work, so the family's economic situation is getting more stable by the day. For the next loan, she wishes to borrow 600 USD to buy additional merchandise as requested by the customers for the upcoming Tet Holiday. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br

I have resided in a city named Borewala, Pakistan since 1985. I belong to a Punjabi family. Punjabi people are famous for their kind heart and soft feelings. I am proud to be called a Punjabi. My husband's name is A. G., and he is a wood seller by profession, and has 20 years of experience. I have five children: four sons and one daughter. My first two sons drive a tractor for agriculture. The other two work as delivery men and use a donkey cart for loading material from one place to another. My daughter stays at home and helps me in making embroidered dresses. I make embroidered clothes by order and earn Pak rupees 2000. My work supports my husband in some ways, e.g. to pay electricity bills, and water bills. I successfully repaid my first loan which I took from Asasah (a microfinance institute of Pakistan). Now I am applying again to expand my husband\u2019s business of buying wood.\r\n\r\nI am a group leader of a few more members in my locality. Sajida S. baji wants a loan to buy wood to resell. Ameeran baji wants a loan to buy plastic shopping bags to resell. Samreen naz baji wants a loan to repair her vehicle named \u201cShahzore\u201d. Razia sultana baji wants a loan to buy iron to resell. \r\n\r\nThis is a group loan. The loan funds will be distributed among the group members, each of whom will invest in her own business. The members mutually guarantee one another's loans. If one member does not repay, the other members are responsible.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":241833,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fuel\/Firewood","sector":"Retail","use":"To

Borewala city is famous for its sweetmeat and handicrafts. I have been living in this city for the past 20 years. I am a widow and am bringing up my children without any support. My husband left me in circumstances where I had no way to go on. But I am very thankful to God that I know the skill of embroidery and sewing clothes. This skill helps me in improving my financial conditions. I am a mother of five children: three sons and two daughters. My elder son is a carpenter and makes wooden doors. The next son drives a truck. My younger son has a scrap business. My two daughters are enrolled in a local school. I want to give my daughters a good education. For this purpose I am still involved in an embroidery business. I save my money to pay their tuition and school fees. I have successfully paid my first loan to Asasah (a microfinance institute in Pakistan). Now, I am applying to buy wood for my elder son so that he able to make more wooden doors and earn a good profit.\r\n\r\nI am a group leader of a few more women in my locality. Shamshad and Razia each want a loan to pay the installments of their auto-rickshaws (a local three-wheeled motor vehicle). Nazia wants a loan to buy an auto-rickshaw . Najma wants a loan to buy wood to resell. Fatima wants a loan to repair their vehicle (named \u201cShahzore\u201d). \r\n\r\nThis is a group loan. The loan funds will be distributed among the group members, each of whom will invest in her own business. The members mutually guarantee each other's loans. If one member does not repay, the other members are

Her husband manages a blacksmithy and repair workshop where the capital was also financed by Paglaum MPC.<P>\r\n\r\nAll these loans were repaid in a timely manner, and Maricel remains until present a member in good standing. The loan windows of Paglaum MPC helped the couple send their children to school.  Recently, Maricel is hooked on the idea of putting up a little \"sari-sari\" (variety) store.  She thinks their daily needs can be supplied by the income from the store.  She said it's not a losing battle facing everyday hardships, having her husband by her siD..  And she is truly thankful to Paglaum MPC for keeping them company in all their financial needs.  What they focus on is taking care of their existing businesses. <P>\r\n\r\nMaricel has applied for a loan in the amount of PHP 40,000 which shall be used for expanding their blacksmith business.  A portion of the amount will be for her little store and a fraction will be for the educational needs of her daughter who is in college.<P>\r\n\r\nIn the future, the couple wishes to operate a real grocery store and wants to acquire a \"videoke\" machine.  They aspire to support their children through their chosen courses and until they establish their own careers.  Maricel said all the reason  for their sacrifices is their children."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":240080,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Blacksmith","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"additional capital for blacksmith, stock for \"sari-sari\" (variety) store & education of her children","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Palayan, Aloran, Mis.

History of note includes: it was once a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; the birthplace of the great Persian poet Rudaki; and the birthplace of the most famous Islamic philosopher Ibn Sina (Avicenna). The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p> \r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients have a viable business proposition when they request a loan. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and IMON will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

History of note includes: it was once a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; the birthplace of the great Persian poet Rudaki; and the birthplace of the most famous Islamic philosopher Ibn Sina (Avicenna). The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p> \r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients have a viable business proposition when they request a loan. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and IMON will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

For social reasons, she quit school to devote herself to earning a living with her mother. After long periods of training, she decided to specialize in buying and selling party supplies. With 15 years of experience, Ramata Traor\u00e9 has mastered this business and is very sought after by young girls and women in the area. In order to build up her business, she joined a women\u2019s group in her neighborhood. After two group loans, both of which have been properly repaid, she is seeking her first individual loan. She plans to use this loan to buy 15 dozens of hair extensions (of different sorts and qualities) from wholesalers in Bamako (capital of Mali). She sells these items at the big market in Bougouni as well as in the neighborhood where she lives. The fruitful periods of her sales are around the holidays (Christmas, Ramadan, Tabaski, St. Sylvester\u2026) and social events (weddings, baptisms\u2026). Her clientele is generally composed of women and the sales are usually carried out in cash and at retail. With this loan, she counts on earning 30,000 CFA francs a month, which she hopes to use to improve the bottom line of her business, repay her loan, and provide for her personal needs.<br

The women trade in various products, such as clothing, cosmetics, stuffed animals, and cellphones.  They also sell traditional Latin American food.  The men work in the smelting and casting of metals.  Since there is significant competition for business in the commercial sector, the women need to increase the money they have to work with, so that they may stably lower their prices and enable themselves to sell a greater quantity of goods in less time.  By doing this, they will create a greater flow of incoming money, which will allow them to better respond to market demands and to improve quality of life for themselves and their families.

His wife, Mrs. Touch Pov, owns a small grocery store where she sells grocery products. \r\n<P>\r\nThis is a village bank loan consisting of mainly end-of-term loans. Five members have end-of-term loans and the rest have monthly payment loans. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK\u2019s main loan type. Borrowers are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. Borrowers can repay portions of the principal earlier than the end of the term if they are financially able, which most clients tend to do.

Mrs. Yom S. is a farmer who owns a 1 hectare farm on which she cultivates rice for a living. However, she does not have enough money to buy rice seeds this season. She is requesting a loan to buy them. The loan will also allow her to buy more fertilizer and pesticides to increase her crop yield. Her husband, Mr. M. Gnoy, is a laborer.\r\n\r\nThis is a village bank loan consisting mainly of end-of-term loans. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK\u2019s main loan type. Borrowers are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. Borrowers can repay portions of the principal earlier T. the end of the term if they are financially able, which most clients tend to do. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time.

Currently, in addition to raising livestock, Mrs. Pham and her husband work as basket weavers to increase the family's income.  Her two children also help the couple out financially each month, so the family's income is very stable.  She would like to borrow 7,000,000 VND to partly invest in raising livestock and to invest in her daughter's tailor business.     <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by Thiennga Ngo, Kiva

Mr. L. M. is a farmer who owns a small piece of land on which he cultivates rice for a living. However, he does not have enough money to buy rice seeds this season.  He is therefore requesting a loan to buy them. The loan will also allow H. to purchase fertilizer to increase his crop yield. His wife, Mrs. Sman L.

Borrowers are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. Borrowers can repay portions of the principal earlier than the end of the term if they are financialL. able, which most clients tend to do.

Three of her children work in a garment factory while the others attend the local school. She has 0.5 hectare plot on which she cultivates rice for a living. Unfortunately, her field is infertile. To rectify the problem, Mrs. Nub S. is requesting a loan to buy fertilizers to increase her crop yield. Her husband, Mr. H. S., helps her with the farm. \r\n<P>\r\nThis is a village bank loan consisting of end-of-term loans. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK\u2019s main loan type. Borrowers are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term.

Hamrojon is a 53-year-old mother whose husband has no fixed income. So, to cover day-to-day necessities, she processes and sells dried apricots with the help of her son. She uses all the money she makes to care for her three children and provide for their education. Hamrojon has 11 years of experience in processing and selling dried apricots. She is very polite and considerate and her clients are always very happy with the service they receive from her. Because her business is doing so well, she is increasing her net worth month by month. Today Hamrojon is requesting 2500 Somoni (750 USD) for the term of 3 months. She is going to spend the loan to purchase dried apricots with the purpose of processing them in order to increase the range of her goods on sale. Hamrojon and her son express their gratitude to everyone for supporting them and they promise to repay their loan in a timely manner.  \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and the birthplace of the great Persian poet Rudaki and the most famous Islamic philosopher Ibn Sina (Avicenna). The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

Her husband (who is pictured in the photo) helps her with the business and usually sells dresses at the market, while Ergashjon is always busy fulfilling orders from her customers.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

The civil war, which took place soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., severely damaged the already-weak economic infrastructure and caused a sharp decline in agricultural production and the manufacturing sector.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  All of these factors have resulted in a severe lack of jobs and have forced hundreds of thousands to leave Tajikistan to find work in other countries, mostly in Russia.  While Tajikistan has experienced some economic growth since the end of the Civil War, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON International's mission is to promote sustainable economic development and improved quality of life in Tajikistan by insuring reliable access to financial services for the economically active members of the population.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They are neighbors who have united to form a group eligible for credit. They are of humble origins but while their homes may be modest, they are clean and well kept. Their businesses are based in their homes, where they make everything they sell as vendors at the markets of Managua and Masaya. Thanks to the loans they have received from ADIM, El Manzano's members have been able to overcome their feelings of insecurity and financial uncertainty and finally feel able to take control of their lives. \r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Lilliam, for example, has been working in the markets since she was a child, selling clothes with her older sister. When Lilliam married, her husband gave her a little money so that she could start her own clothing business, but it is only currently, with the help of ADIM, that she truly has access to working capital. \r\n\r\nWith these loans, each member of the group hopes to see their business grow. Additionally, they would like to invest in improving their houses, but this is a long term goal. In order to achieve their dreams, they will continue to make punctual payments on their loans and save what they can from their incomes. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Sara Sultan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":242753,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Working capital, business expansion","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Nindiri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.004722 -86.119444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":120,"posted_date":"2008-12-20T21:20:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Esteban Agust\u00edn ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lilliam ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carolina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Miriam Esperanza ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":10058.8,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":2011.76},{"due_date":"2009-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2011.76},{"due_date":"2009-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":2011.76},{"due_date":"2009-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2011.76},{"due_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2011.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":105}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":105,"local_amount":2011.76,"processed_date":"2008-12-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T09:43:16Z","rounded_local_amount":2078.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9891095,"comment":null},{"amount":105,"local_amount":2011.76,"processed_date":"2009-01-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T09:14:09Z","rounded_local_amount":2078.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14814369,"comment":null},{"amount":105,"local_amount":2011.76,"processed_date":"2009-01-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T09:14:38Z","rounded_local_amount":2078.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14814370,"comment":null},{"amount":105,"local_amount":2011.76,"processed_date":"2009-02-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:15:25Z","rounded_local_amount":2078.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20349250,"comment":null},{"amount":105,"local_amount":2011.76,"processed_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-28T07:59:46Z","rounded_local_amount":2078.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20349251,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-12-21T13:53:00Z","paid_date":"2009-03-28T07:59:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":80634,"name":"Esi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Esi A. is 35 years old.
