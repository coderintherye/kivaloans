She owns a business venture, selling a variety of different products in the local community.  Laumua has 3 years of experience in this business.  Laumua needs a loan of WST $1750 to purchase additional products to sell.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 800 talas or US $333 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nLaumua joined SPBD.  This is her 4th loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Laumua's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Laumua F. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.7 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

R. is 27 and married with 5 children.  She owns a business venture, selling puletasi (Samoan formal wear).  Pele has 3 years of experience in this business.  Pele needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase additional fabrics & materials.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 600 talas or US $250 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nPele joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Pele's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Pele R. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.7 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

B. is a 28-year-old woman who is passionate about her desire for having her own children. It has been one year and a half since she married her husband who is a farmer. Since then, they both long to have their own children. Despite not having one until now, Sonia believes that since her and her husband\u2019s faith is strong, one day God will answer their prayer.  \r\n\r\nInstead of preoccupying herself with the thought of having her own child to nurture and love, she concentrates on loving and caring for her husband instead. She saw how hard he works all day in the field just to have his own income to provide her with her needs. Thus, she wanted to help him enhance his rice farming business by supporting his financial need to be able to purchase fertilizer, seedlings and other necessary farm inputs. Since her membership in ASHI in 2009, some portion of the loans she received has been used for this purpose and some was used to put up her own business which is a \u201csari-sari\u201d (variety) store business.  \r\n\r\nSonia feels happy having her own business to manage, because she can be productive and make herself her busy and not think too much about having a baby. Now, she is requesting a larger amount to finance her intention of growing her \u201csari-sari\u201d store. She wants to have more savings to be able to improve their standard of living while they don\u2019t have children yet and in preparation for having children in the

 Taupou is 52 and married with 6 children.  She owns a business venture, selling pancakes (fried flour pancakes flavored with lemon or coconut jam).  Saili  has 3 years of experience in this business.  Saili  needs a loan of WST $2000 to buy flour, flavoring, sugar, and plastic bags.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 750 talas or US $313 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nSaili  joined SPBD.This is her 4th loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Saili 's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Saili  Taupou are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.7 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

P. is 66 and married with 6 children.  She owns a business venture, catching & selling ocean-caught fish .  Faaiu has 3 years of experience in this business.  Faaiu needs a loan of WST $1300 to purchase fishing equipment including hooks & nets.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 600 talas or US $250 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Faaiu joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Faaiu's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Faaiu P. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.7 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.

F. is 44 and married with 6 children.  She owns a business venture, selling lavalavas (bottom-half wrap-around prints worn by both men and women).  Leipu has 2 years of experience in this business.  Leipu needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase additional fabrics & materials.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 350 talas or US $146 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Leipu joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Leipu's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Leipu F. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.7 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

S. is 18 and single with no children.  She works in her 's business, planting & harvesting  a variety of vegetables for sale.  Connie has 1 year of experience in this business.  Connie needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 talas or US $188 per week) to financially support immediate members of her family.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Connie joined SPBD.  This is her 1st loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Connie's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Connie S. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.7 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

Isara P. is 23 and married with 1 child.  She owns a business venture, selling Samoan Biscuit made from breadfruit.  Faigame has 1 year of experience in this business.  Faigame needs a loan of WST $1000 to buy raw ingredients for cooked foods.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Faigame joined SPBD.    This is her 1st loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Faigame's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Faigame Isara P. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.7 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

 S. is 45 and married with 10 children.  She owns a business venture, selling both food & daily use products in the local community.  Asia  has many years of experience in this business.  Asia  needs a loan of WST $2500 to purchase additional products to sell.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 600 talas or US $250 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\n\nIn 2007, Asia  joined SPBD.  This is her 4th loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Asia 's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\n\nAbout SPBD\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\n\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She owns a business venture, selling both food & daily use products in the local community.  Tupuai  has 5 years of experience in this business.  Tupuai  needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase additional products to sell.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 400 talas or US $167 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Tupuai  joined SPBD.    This is her 1st loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Tupuai 's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Tupuai  F. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.87 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She owns a business venture, selling ice-cakes (flavored ice in styrofoam cups).  Sosefina has 2 years of experience in this business.  Sosefina needs a loan of WST $1500 to buy sugar, styrofoam cups, and codial (flavoring).  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 200 talas or US $83 per week) to financially support immediate members of her family.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Sosefina joined SPBD.    This is her 3rd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Sosefina's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Sosefina P. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.3 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.3 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.4 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting cocoa for sale.  Sisifo has 3 years of experience in this business.  Sisifo needs a loan of WST $2200 to purchase general farm supplies & equipment.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 300 talas or US $125 per week) to pay for her children's tuition fees.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Sisifo joined SPBD.  This is her 3rd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Sisifo's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Sisifo F. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.3 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.3 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.4 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

M. is 44 and married with 9 children (ages 3 - 23).  She owns a business venture, providing dress making services to local community members.  Talalelei has 4 years of experience in this business.  Talalelei needs a loan of WST $2000 to purchase new sewing machine.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 400 talas or US $167 per week) to pay for her children's tuition fees.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Talalelei joined SPBD.    This is her 4th loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Talalelei's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Talalelei M. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.3 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.3 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.4 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

C., aged 43, is widowed and resides with her husband in Kampong Chnang province, Cambodia. She has four children. \r\nVoang C. works in the agricultural sector growing rice, and earns approximately $4 USD in revenue per day. She has been engaged in this business since 2004.

F. is 23 and married with 1 child.

Punauli needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase additional fabrics & materials.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 250 talas or US $104 per week) to financially support immediate members of her family.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Punauli joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Punauli's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Punauli F. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.3 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.3 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.4 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling daily use products such as vinegar, shampoo, soap and toothpaste in the local community.

Jocelyn is requesting a new loan of 6,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Jocelyn from GDMPC.

T. is 55 and married with 7 children (ages 20 - 32).  She owns a business venture, selling ice-cakes (flavored ice in styrofoam cups).  Paulia has 3 years of experience in this business.  Paulia needs a loan of WST $1500 to buy sugar, styrofoam cups, and codial (flavoring).  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 200 talas or US $83 per week) to financially support immediate members of her family.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Paulia joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Paulia's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Paulia T. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.3 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.3 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.4 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

Teriki","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Minerva Teriki P. is 22 and single with 1 child ( year-old).  She owns a business venture, selling both food & daily use products in the local community.  Minerva has 3 years of experience in this business.  Minerva needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase additional products to sell.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 300 talas or US $125 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Minerva joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Minerva's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Minerva Teriki P. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.3 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.3 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 600 talas or US $250 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Feliai joined SPBD.  This is her 1st loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Feliai's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Feliai A. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.87 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

G. is from the village of Dapacan Alto Calamba Misamis Occidental. She is 49 years old. Teofila is married and has 2 adult-aged children. To make a living, Teofila owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector operating a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap and toothpaste in the local community. Teofila has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Teofila joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Teofila has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional inventory and working capital. Teofila is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Teofila from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

S. is 65 and married with 8 children (ages 28 - 42).  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Mareta has 2 years of experience in this business.  Mareta needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 400 talas or US $167 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nYou can view pictures of a typical plantation in Samoa, taken by a Kiva Fellow, at:   http:\/\/picasaweb.google.com\/agnes.p.chu\/SamoanPlantation\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Mareta joined SPBD.    This is her 1st loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Mareta's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Mareta S. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.3 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.4 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

K. is widowed and resides with her children in Kampong Chnang province, Cambodia. She has two children. She is engaged in a business of selling porridge in the morning at her home, earning approximately USD 4 in revenue per day. She has been with the business since 2007.  Her son operates his motorbike as a driver, earning an income of USD 4.16 per day.

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Rufo has 3 years of experience in this business.  Rufo needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 talas or US $188 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Rufo joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Rufo's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Rufo P. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.3 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.5 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She owns a business venture, selling pancakes (fried flour pancakes flavored with lemon or coconut jam).  Talaileva has 2 years of experience in this business.  Talaileva needs a loan of WST $1500 to buy flour, flavoring, sugar, and plastic bags.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 400 talas or US $167 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Talaileva joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Talaileva's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\n\"The following social metrics for Talaileva S. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.6 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.

I. is 34 and married with 4 children.  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting fruits & vegetables for sale.  Segivao has 3 years of experience in this business.  Segivao needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase general farm supplies & equipment.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nYou can view pictures of a typical vegetable garden in Samoa, taken by a Kiva Fellow, at:   http:\/\/picasaweb.google.com\/agnes.p.chu\/VegetableGarden#\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Segivao joined SPBD.    This is her 3rd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Segivao's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Segivao I. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.8 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

L. is 48 and married with 5 children.  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting fruits & vegetables for sale.  Tumama has 3 years of experience in this business.  Tumama needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 200 talas or US $83 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Tumama joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Tumama's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Tumama L. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.8 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

SPBD's loans are Lopepe's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Lopepe V. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.7 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.5 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

V. is 25 and married with 1 child.  She is starting a business venture, selling traditional handicrafts to tourists and local community members.  Saolo needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase raw materials to make additional handicrafts.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 250 talas or US $104 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Saolo joined SPBD.  This is her 1st loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Saolo's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Saolo V. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.7 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.5 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

A. is 37 and married with 3 children.  She owns a business venture, selling pork products in the local community.  Mesepa has 1 year of experience in this business.  Mesepa needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase new equipment & tools to expand the business.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 250 talas or US $104 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Mesepa joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Mesepa's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Mesepa A. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.9 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.7 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.8 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

F. is 28 and married with 1 child.  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Tafaoga has 1 year of experience in this business.  Tafaoga needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Tafaoga joined SPBD.    This is her 1st loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Tafaoga's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Tafaoga F. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.7 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.5 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

S. is from the village of Dawo. She is 47 years old, single, and has a school-aged child. To make a living, she runs a general store  selling a variety of different products. Rosenda has been in the business for over seven years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month. \r\n\r\nIn 2008, Rosenda joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional inventory and working capital. Rosenda is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand her inventory. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Rosenda from PMPC and the second from KIVA. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

F. is 56 and married with 7 children (ages 15 - 37).  She owns a business venture which is agriculture.  Tulua has 5 years of experience in this business.  Tulua needs a loan of WST $1700 0.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 600 talas or US $250 per week) to make improvements to her house.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Tulua joined SPBD.  This is her 4th loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Tulua's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Tulua F. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.8 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

A. C. is 37 and married with 4 children (ages 3 - 12).  She owns a business venture, selling baked goods in the local community.  Faamita has 3 years of experience in this business.  Faamita needs a loan of WST $1750 to purchase new items to expand product offering.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Faamita joined SPBD.    This is her 3rd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Faamita's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Faamita A. C. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.9 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

A. is 45 and married with 5 children (ages 3 - 22).  She owns a business venture, 0 0.  Sosefina has 4 years of experience in this business.  Sosefina needs a loan of WST $1900 to maintain vehicle.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Sosefina joined SPBD.    This is her 3rd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Sosefina's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Sosefina A. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.9 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She owns a business venture, selling puletasi (Samoan formal wear).  Tatupu has many years of experience in this business.  Tatupu needs a loan of WST $2000 to purchase additional fabrics & materials.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 talas or US $188 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Tatupu joined SPBD.  This is her 4th loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Tatupu's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Tatupu M. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.5 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Metuli Maliota is 55 and married with 5 children (ages 15 - 29).  She is starting a business venture,  which is flower garden.  Metuli needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchse additional garden equipments.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 talas or US $188 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Metuli joined SPBD.    This is her 1st loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Metuli's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Metuli Maliota are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.5 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.5 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

S. is 63 and married with 5 children (ages 15 - 36).  She owns a business venture, selling food products in the local community.  Faalilo has 2 years of experience in this business.  Faalilo needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase additional products to sell.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 550 talas or US $229 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\n\nIn 2009, Faalilo joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Faalilo's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\n\nAbout SPBD\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\n\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

A. is a 57-year-old married woman who lives in Hda. San Ramon, Brgy. Poblacion, Bayawan City, Negros Oriental. She earns her living by fruit vending. Agustina\u2019s husband Fortunato, who is 70 years old, has a hog-raising business. Because they have no children, they are saving up their earnings so that they can support themselves in their old age.\r\n\r\nAgustina joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve their quality of life. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD she has been able to increase their family income by engaging in fruit vending. Now she earns an average monthly income of Php 18,000 from her business activities.\r\n\r\nAgustina is a member in good standing. In her previous loan cycle, she only borrowed Php 3,000 to augment her working capital for her fruit vending business,  but now that summer is here and fruit is abundant, she is borrowing (for her 14th loan) the amount of Php 15,000, which she intends to use to buy more stock for her fruit vending business. Agustina is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family--to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":507937,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

They have 3 children who are between 25 to 40 years old, two of whom have their own families; one is still single but is already gainfully employed.\r\n\r\nAurelia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2003 in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve the quality of life of their family. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD she has been able to increase their family income by running her general store and restaurant\/eatery business. Now she earns an average monthly income of PHP 22,400 from her business activities.\r\n\r\nAurelia is a member in good standing. Her previous loan of Php 20,000 was used to fund operations of her general store and restaurant, and it had a positive impact in both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is borrowing for her 13th loan, the amount of Php 20,000, which she intends to use to sustain the operations of her general store.  Aurelia is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which is to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

T. is a 48-year-old widow who supports her family by running a general store and restaurant or eatery business. She lives in Brgy. Prosperidad, San Carlos City, Negros Occidental with her two married children (who are 23 and 24 years old) and her two grandchildren.\n\nShe has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2003 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her general store and restaurant businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 19,600.\n\nCarmelita is now borrowing PHP 17,000 so that she could continue to sustain her general store and restaurant. This will be her 13th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Carmelita aspires to elevate her family\u2019s living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the \u201cDungganon\u201d way.  \n\nAbout NWTF:\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

She is 59 years old. Erlinda is the group leader of a 5-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nErlinda is married and has 7 adult-aged children. To make a living, Erlinda owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector running a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food & daily use products in the local community. Erlinda has been engaged in her business for over 8 years and earns approximately 6000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Erlinda joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Erlinda has successfully repaid a previous loan of 14,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Erlinda is requesting a new loan of 15000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand product offering. This loan will be the sixth loan taken out by Erlinda from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of the borrower's family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":511003,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase new items to expand product offering","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Brgy.Vista Alegere,Bayombong,Nueva Vizcaya","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":123,"posted_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:26Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Erlinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Christine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tessie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marianne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":65000,"loan_amount":1450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2709},{"due_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2709},{"due_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":2709},{"due_date":"2010-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":2709},{"due_date":"2010-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2709},{"due_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2709},{"due_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2709},{"due_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2709},{"due_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2709},{"due_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2709},{"due_date":"2010-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2709},{"due_date":"2010-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2709},{"due_date":"2010-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2709},{"due_date":"2010-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2709},{"due_date":"2010-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2709},{"due_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2709},{"due_date":"2010-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":2709},{"due_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2709},{"due_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2709},{"due_date":"2010-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2709},{"due_date":"2010-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2709},{"due_date":"2010-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2709},{"due_date":"2010-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2709},{"due_date":"2010-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2693}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.43},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.43},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.43},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.44},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.43},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.43},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.43},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.43},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.43},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.44},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.43},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.43},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.43},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.43},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.43},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.43},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.44},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.43},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.43},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.43},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.43},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.43},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.44},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.07}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":187141,"name":"Margret","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Margret, aged 48 years, is the mother of three children.

In future, she hopes to grow in business and even try out other business ventures like property management and real estates to add her income. She is a very hardworking, humble and caring lady.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":511205,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used

Noreen is requesting a new loan of 15000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Noreen from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the borrower's business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

Francis has been in this business for 11 years and he learned about KADET from the staff of World Vision. He stocks men\u2019s shoes only, and thus most of his clients are men.

He has been in this business for the last three years. Tom gets the shoes from vendors in the capital city, Nairobi, and sells them at a profit in Kisumu. He sells shoes for both genders. \r\n\r\nTom learned about KADET Ltd. from a friend who is an existing client. This is his third loan. He intends to use the loan to increase his stock of ladies shoes, since the season for school shoes is over. He will also buy sports shoes since most of his clients have been asking for them.\r\n\r\nFrom the profits made, he intends to open a dairy shop for his wife. Tom, a hardworking and industrious man, has a dream of expanding his business by having a variety of shoes.

She is 40 years old, married, and is the mother of two children who are 20 and 14 years old.  They both go to school.  She only completed the 7th grade due to her early marriage.  She lives in her own house with her family and does not support anybody else.\r\n\r\nShe left Matutuine for the city of Maputo during the Civil War.  Later on, she built her own home with her husband in the Boane district, where she now lives.  She has had her own business for over 5 years.  She does not have any employees and she earns about 6,000 MZN each month, which she uses to pay for household expenses.  She even saves some in her bank account.\r\n\r\nHelena has had loans before with the CCP Bank, but she later decided not to continue with them for various reasons.  She found out about Hluvuku through a neighbor who is also a client of the institution.  This is her third loan, which has a value of 20,000 MZN.  She will use it to buy products (beer, soft drinks, water, juice, etc.) in order to increase her supply.  The previous loans were for 13,000 MZN and 15,000 MZN, both for the same purpose.  She promises to pay back the loan on time so she can take out other loans.  In the future, she would like to request more loans to build up her business establishment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Erika Korowin, Kiva

He uses this money for household expenses and saves some in his bank account.\r\n\r\nTiago has never had loans with other banks.  He learned about Hluvuku through a friend who is also a customer of this institution.  This is his first loan.  He is asking for 15,000 meticais to buy construction materials (cement, stone, sand and other materials) in order to build his house.\r\n\r\nHe promises to pay off this loan promptly so he can take out more loans.  In the future, he would like to ask for more loans to continue construction on his home.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Danielle Maxson, Kiva

She is 34 years old, widowed, and mother to four children, ages 11, 8, 6, and 4.  The three eldest go to school.  Anabela only finished tenth grade; she quit when she lost her husband.  She lives in her own house with her children and does not support anyone else.\r\n\r\nWhen she got married, Anabela left Maputo for the city of Matola, where she established residence together with her late husband.  She has had her own business for more than 11 years.  She has no employees and sells mainly soft drinks.  Her monthly income is about 5,500 meticais, which she uses for household expenses.  She also saves some money with friends through Xitique (a traditional system of rotating savings).\r\n\r\nAnabela has taken out loans before with the Tchuma Credit Association.  She decided not to continue with them for several reasons.  She learned about Hluvuku from a neighbor who is also a customer at this institution.  This is her third loan.  She is asking for 15,000 meticais, which she will use to buy products (eggs, oil, rice, peanuts and other products) to increase and diversify her inventory.\r\n\r\nShe promises to pay off this loan on time so she can take out more loans.

She never took loans in other banks and she heard of Hluvuku through a relative that's also a client. \r\n\r\nThis is her first loan and she's asking for U$475, which she'll use to buy more merchandise (apples, pastries, beverages, bananas and others) to diversify her business and attract more clients. She is committed to pay the loan on time to take others in the future, as she dreams of remodeling her house.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Mariana Dauwe, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":511358,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchase of food and beverages for reselling","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Boane, Maputo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-26.041667 32.325278","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:27Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Guilhermina Francisco","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":15000,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":659.14},{"due_date":"2010-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":688.93},{"due_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":720.08},{"due_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":752.63},{"due_date":"2010-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":786.65},{"due_date":"2010-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":822.21},{"due_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":859.38},{"due_date":"2010-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":898.23},{"due_date":"2010-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":938.84},{"due_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":981.28},{"due_date":"2011-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1025.64},{"due_date":"2011-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1072},{"due_date":"2011-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1120.46},{"due_date":"2011-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1171.11},{"due_date":"2011-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1224.05},{"due_date":"2011-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1279.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.87},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.82},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.8},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.83},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.92},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.03},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.22},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.44},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.73},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.07},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.48},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.95},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.48},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.09},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.76},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.51}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":46.78,"local_amount":1477.4,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:14:25Z","rounded_local_amount":1493.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136698746,"comment":null},{"amount":428.22,"local_amount":13522.6,"processed_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-01T07:59:47Z","rounded_local_amount":13673.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151916230,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-04-05T13:27:18Z","paid_date":"2010-09-01T07:59:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":187263,"name":"Abdel-Rahman","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Abdel-Rahman has owned a fishing boat since 2000.

Rachidatou is thus asking for a third loan from ALID\u00e9 in order to strengthen her business and better satisfy her clientele.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Kelly Percival, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":511406,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase of cassava and palm oil","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Porto-Novo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.483333 2.616667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2010-03-23T18:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rachidatou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":100000,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":9090.91},{"due_date":"2010-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":9090.91},{"due_date":"2010-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":9090.91},{"due_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":9090.91},{"due_date":"2010-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":9090.91},{"due_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":9090.91},{"due_date":"2010-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":9090.91},{"due_date":"2010-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":9090.91},{"due_date":"2011-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":9090.91},{"due_date":"2011-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":9090.91},{"due_date":"2011-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":9090.9}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.45},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.46},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.45},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.46},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.45},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.46},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.45},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.46},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.45},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.46},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":20.45,"local_amount":9090.91,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:40:22Z","rounded_local_amount":9925.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144653279,"comment":null},{"amount":20.46,"local_amount":9090.91,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-20T07:28:47Z","rounded_local_amount":9925.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151835486,"comment":null},{"amount":20.45,"local_amount":9090.91,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:10:07Z","rounded_local_amount":9925.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159575883,"comment":null},{"amount":20.46,"local_amount":9090.91,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-30T08:15:02Z","rounded_local_amount":9925.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166954397,"comment":null},{"amount":20.45,"local_amount":9090.91,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-30T08:51:27Z","rounded_local_amount":9925.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172056055,"comment":null},{"amount":48.93,"local_amount":21745.45,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-28T09:31:19Z","rounded_local_amount":23740.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177347589,"comment":null},{"amount":12.44,"local_amount":5527.28,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-05T09:07:04Z","rounded_local_amount":6034.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188617496,"comment":null},{"amount":20.45,"local_amount":9090.91,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:09:20Z","rounded_local_amount":9925.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191360915,"comment":null},{"amount":20.46,"local_amount":9090.91,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-28T09:13:25Z","rounded_local_amount":9925.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195779604,"comment":null},{"amount":20.45,"local_amount":9090.9,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-16T08:07:53Z","rounded_local_amount":9925.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201401514,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-03-23T19:39:28Z","paid_date":"2011-04-16T08:07:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":187289,"name":"Patience","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Patience is 48 years old; she is married with 4 children.

","en":"L\u00e9ontine A. was born in 1960 in Porto-Novo, the administrative capital of B\u00e9nin. Married to Etienne Hologan, L\u00e9ontine is the mother of four children who are all educated. But L\u00e9ontine only lives with two of her children. The family has lived in the Avakpa quarter, in Novo-Porto's third district, for five years. Together, the couple takes on the family's various responsibilities.\r\nL\u00e9ontine did not go to school. To meet her needs, she sells food (fried yams, fried bean and banana cakes) in Porto-Novo. L\u00e9ontine gets her supplies at the Ouando market in Porto-Novo.\r\nL\u00e9ontine has already received two loans from ALID\u00e9 which she has repaid in full. Faced with increased demand from her ever-growing clientele, she is asking for a third loan from ALID\u00e9.

Therefore, two years ago she decided to set up a convenience store in her parents\u2019 house.  \r\n\r\nShe started selling a few products, and thanks to her efforts, the business has been slowly growing.  She currently sells groceries, beauty products, women\u2019s and men\u2019s clothing, soft drinks, and beer, among other things.  The variety of products she sells and the good service she offers make her business very well received.\r\n\r\nRaquel wishes to expand her business by purchasing merchandise so that she can satisfy her customers\u2019 demand.  She also wants to get more earnings that will allow her to get ahead and help with the household expenses.\r\n\r\nThat is why she has seen the need of asking Edpyme Alternativa, for the first time, for a loan for 1,500 PEN.  This will help her achieve her objective.\r\n\r\nShe is a very hard-working woman who has fought to get ahead in spite of being a single mother.

She lives with the father of her four small children in a house located on a plot of land that is shared with her brother.  In previous years, she worked as a ticket collector in a coach operated by her domestic partner.  Nonetheless, she dreamt of having her own business.  As such, she undertook to sell chicken soup by way of transient sales.  The first year was difficult because she was working alone.  She later acquired an assistant, whose help she has relied on ever since.  Yesica sets up her sales stall at 3 am near a bus stop, a location that receives a lot of traffic and therein an advantage in making more sales.  She has many clients, including drivers who regularly come to her establishment and drive up her earnings.  She is very happy in this vocation and hopes to save enough to build a house and improve her children's quality of life.  This is her 7th loan with Kiva partner MFP and she is ready to be responsible for making her loans payments.  She likes to work with her communal finance group, as the members are very supportive.

She lives in the San Miguel community, El Valle parish, which is located southeast of the city of Cuena.  This area is known for its important production of corn and its tourist attractions such as the Chochapamba lakes full of bulrushes.\r\nJulia is 61 years old.  She divorced 25 years ago because her husband drank a great deal.  She had three children with her husband, and they are now 42, 33, and 26 years old.  They are married and independent, but Julia has 12 grandchildren who always keep her company.  Three of the grandchildren already work, and only three are in her care because their mother left the country in search of a better future.  The rest of the grandchildren live with their parents but always spend time with their grandmother.  Her dwelling is her own, which makes her life calm and peaceful.\r\nJulia has sold fruits, fresh grains, and vegetables for 30 years.  She had her own sales site, but because of her age she had to sell it.  Now she only works Wednesdays and Saturdays, and the rest of the week is spent in her house.  She also told us that she had a store but she closed it because she couldn't spend enough time in it.

The place where she lives has almost no potable water, so she needs a well.  \r\n\r\nShe has had 13 loans with us in the past, which have been very helpful, enabling her to build her little house, and she is always making improvements to it.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Nadine Riopel, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":511541,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Consumer Goods","sector":"Personal Use","use":"Purchase of a water pump and PVC tubing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"San Rafael","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":74,"posted_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yadira Del Socorro ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":12600,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":985.86},{"due_date":"2010-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1015.03},{"due_date":"2010-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1045.06},{"due_date":"2010-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1075.98},{"due_date":"2010-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1107.82},{"due_date":"2010-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1140.6},{"due_date":"2010-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1174.35},{"due_date":"2010-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1209.1},{"due_date":"2010-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1244.87},{"due_date":"2011-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1281.71},{"due_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1319.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.95},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.77},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.23},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.76},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.31},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.92},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.58},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.28},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.03},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":95.37,"local_amount":2002.74,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:01:05Z","rounded_local_amount":2006.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144686941,"comment":null},{"amount":45.04,"local_amount":945.86,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:35:15Z","rounded_local_amount":947.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151870502,"comment":null},{"amount":45.52,"local_amount":955.9,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-12T07:42:16Z","rounded_local_amount":957.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159610095,"comment":null},{"amount":63.11,"local_amount":1325.25,"processed_date":"2010-08-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-17T07:40:12Z","rounded_local_amount":1327.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166823923,"comment":null},{"amount":33.52,"local_amount":703.96,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-22T07:57:09Z","rounded_local_amount":705.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172090973,"comment":null},{"amount":51.2,"local_amount":1075.1,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:23:43Z","rounded_local_amount":1076.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177382331,"comment":null},{"amount":53.21,"local_amount":1117.46,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:34:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1119.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182519928,"comment":null},{"amount":55.06,"local_amount":1156.3,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:45:31Z","rounded_local_amount":1158.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188654319,"comment":null},{"amount":56.34,"local_amount":1183.24,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:32:08Z","rounded_local_amount":1185.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191397466,"comment":null},{"amount":43.96,"local_amount":923.25,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:31:14Z","rounded_local_amount":924.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195815662,"comment":null},{"amount":57.67,"local_amount":1210.94,"processed_date":"2011-04-01T06:59:59Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:40:52Z","rounded_local_amount":1212.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201259115,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-05-24T17:08:21Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T10:40:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":187368,"name":"H.

Tacun is another member of the Los Talvos community bank.  She lives in the San Miguel community in the parish of El Valle.  The parish is known for maize production and for the beauty of the surrounding countryside.  The majority of its people make a living farming and raising livestock.  Many young people have migrated to cities and other countries in the hope that they can help their families secure a better future.\r\n\r\nOur member makes a living raising animals--chickens, pigs, cattle--that she only sells when she needs money.  She also farms her land, growing maize mostly, work that she has done diligently for forty years.  The business hasn't grown, though, because she hasn't known how to do it.\r\n\r\nAna Maria, 60, has been a widow since her husband died of a brain tumor 12 years ago.  She and her husband had ten children, eight of whom are married and independent.  The other two, who are 20 and 17 years old, work at construction jobs, helping their mother when they can.  They also study at a night school.

With the 2000 soles she requests she will buy chairs and beer to increase her income which will be very useful to maintain her home.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Daniel Burke, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":511554,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"Buy chairs and beer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-03-22T21:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julissa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":165}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:16Z","rounded_local_amount":167.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128993387,"comment":null},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:38:04Z","rounded_local_amount":167.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136718188,"comment":null},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:55Z","rounded_local_amount":167.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751863,"comment":null},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:03:24Z","rounded_local_amount":167.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151934323,"comment":null},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:55Z","rounded_local_amount":167.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159673090,"comment":null},{"amount":57.75,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:40:06Z","rounded_local_amount":165.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166886920,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-03-23T00:11:35Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:40:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":187373,"name":"Sidonie","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"N\u00e9e en 1975 \u00e0 Atchoukpa \u00e0 Avrankou, dans le d\u00e9partement de l'Ou\u00e9m\u00e9, D.

She is currently requesting a $1,500,000 COP, which will be invested in purchasing hammock cord, fine thread to make handbags, and wool to make backpacks. She will also buy such merchandise as apparel, cosmetics and footwear to expand her business. <p>\r\nOlga spent a large part of her childhood living in a small town in San Jacinto Bol\u00edvar called Bajo Grande, until she was 10 years old and was displaced while fleeing from the armed conflict at that time. She then came to live in San Jacinto, but this is all a part of her history. Ms. Olga has obtained two loans, which she has already repaid, from this institute. Her business has been very beneficial to her family because her husband's income is insufficient and she always helps with the household expenses. Olga dreams of obtaining her own house, expanding her business, and in so doing increasing the family income. Her greatest challenge was having to leave her town in order to save her life because she had to withstand difficult moments and financial hardships. She and her husband now live in apart for job reasons. Thank God that they are now overcoming these difficulties, and she now hopes for a more promising future for both her and her family.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Elizabeth

Sonia lives on a farm where she is involved in various productive activities including animal rearing (and selling), harvesting crops such as bananas, plantains and peppers, and the production of organic fertilizer. This loan will be used to make general investments in the expansion of her various productive activities. For example, Sonia plans to use this loan to finance the purchase of chickens and animal feed as well as nutrients to use when working with her crops.\r\n\r\nThe daily routine in Sonia\u2019s family consists of an early wakeup followed by tending to the animals and then working on fertilizer production and tending to the crops. Her goal is to everyday improve her productive methods and to integrate her family into the farming process.\r\n\r\nSonia has lived on the farm in Pococi for the past six years. She is described by the loan consultant that has been working with her as a hardworking, organized woman with an entrepreneurial spirit. Sonia is dedicated to her business as much as she is to her family. She would like to study English and accounting; her dream is to brand her farm as a rural tourist destination where individuals interested in organic foods could come to observe her methods of production. Sonia is very knowledgeable about agriculture and she hopes to use this loan to exploit the benefits of her home-made organic fertilizer. Occasionally, Sonia offers workshops to people interested in agriculture and farming.\r\n\r\nSonia has cited communication problems as one of her main obstacles. At the moment, she is waiting to hear back from the government body in charge of phone installations to find out how she might go about getting a phone in her home. Another obstacle for her has been a lack of access to financial services. In the past, Sonia has not been able to obtain the economic resources necessary for the expansion of her poultry-selling business. This loan will fill the void in financial services that has existed in the past for Sonia and her family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":511643,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To

Maritza's greatest desire is to buy another car for her own use. This is her seventh loan with MFP, and she agrees to continue making her payments, as in previous cases. Likewise, she enjoys working with her communal bank. With the loan she is requesting, she will pay for the maintenance of her car and replace some of the parts it needs.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Rachel McRoberts, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":511644,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","use":"Pay for car maintenance and spare parts","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-03-22T23:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maritza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":165}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:22Z","rounded_local_amount":167.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128993389,"comment":null},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:38:15Z","rounded_local_amount":167.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136718190,"comment":null},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:40:06Z","rounded_local_amount":167.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751865,"comment":null},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:03:02Z","rounded_local_amount":167.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151934325,"comment":null},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:37:07Z","rounded_local_amount":167.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159673092,"comment":null},{"amount":57.75,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:29Z","rounded_local_amount":165.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166886922,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-03-23T03:09:48Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":187415,"name":"Dora Isabel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Dora Isabel  tiene 59 a\u00f1os de edad, es una mujer casada y tiene 2 hijos a su cargo.

She sells hair products and cosmetics in her business, which is called El Punto de La Belleza.  She is married and has two daughters, 16 and 18 years old.\r\n\r\nHer loan for 2,000,000 COP will be invested in working capital to buy hair products and cosmetics like creams, sunscreen, and shampoos.  She will also use the money to enhance her women\u2019s accessories like necklaces and bracelets that her family designs. \r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n, and she wants her business to keep growing.  She wants it to become recognized as the place to go to get everything needed to create a good image.\r\n\r\nAs she wants to create her own brand of accessories that she designs, her main challenge is to strengthen this line and position it in the market.  \r\n\r\nShe learned to work with hair products when she was a commercial advisor in an important business.  With her effort and tenacity she started to work independently.  She started with a display case.  Then, when she had more experience, she moved to a place located very close to her house in the country neighborhood.\r\n\r\nThe move allowed this small businesswoman to enjoy more time with her family.  She is now her own boss.  Above all, she goes with her daughters to practice their favorite sport, skating.  Through this activity she has gotten to know the mothers of their friends, and she has increased the number of customers she has.  The business is located close to the sporting places where they practice this discipline.\r\n\r\nShe has involved her family in her business.  She wants this to be a great business.  Therefore, when she heard her friends talking about the Fundaci\u00f3n, she thought of her dream of continuing to grow and expanding her range of products.\r\n\r\nKeeping in mind that her daughter started studying business administration, and that she also designs accessories like necklaces, earrings, and bracelets, she started selling them.  They have been widely accepted among her customers.  Nubia saw that her daughter had a talent for designing jewelry.  So, she is promoting her business spirit.  \r\n\r\nThat is why she hopes to be helped with a loan, to get ahead with her proposal.  She will use her dynamic nature to be able to meet the challenges of the market.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

Her business is raising and selling small animals, specifically penned birds.  She mainly raises turkeys in pens located in the rear part of her house, and sells them to the businesspersons who come regularly to this place.  This business helps her to take care of the daily household expenses, since her husband's income as an agricultural worker are not sufficient to cover them.  Mar\u00eda Cruz hopes to improve the quality of the birds that she sells, in order to earn greater profits.  For this reason, she sees the need of requesting a loan of $300 for the first time from Edpyme Alternativa that she plans to use to purchase a balanced feed in order to achieve her objective.  She is quite a responsible woman who always gives 100% of herself to get her family ahead.

R. is 61 years old and lives in the Los Calamares neighborhood, southwest of Cartagena de Indias. She is married and has 2 children who are 20 and 30 years old and are working. She has an apparel business for which she is requesting a loan of $2,000.00 because she needs to repair 2 semi-industrial sewing machines and buy supplies such as fabric and eyelet buttons, so that she can fill orders in a timely manner. This is her fourth loan with the Santo Domingo Foundation. She began with $1,400.00 and gradually increased it until arriving at what she is currently applying for. She began her business in 1978, when she bought her first sewing machine, having taken advantage of a shrimp business sale. Estefan\u00eda  learned by studying how to make undergarments, a skill that has served her well when completing small jobs for her friends and neighbors. When she was left without a job due to a massive layoff and without access to a pension, she decided not to be defeated by this situation and she started working on apparel and also making Christmas ornaments and dolls, lingerie, and undergarments. This training has allowed to her to progress, since her business has been an important means of providing for her family. She dreams of taking full advantage of the knowledge she possesses and in the future she wants to offer additional product lines, which she currently cannot manage. With the income that this business will continue to provide, little by little she will build a second floor for her home. She faced her greatest challenge at the outset because she began with very little capital and worked very hard to establish a customer base.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Tara Binetti,

They lives in the neighborhood of Las Calamares in the southwestern section of Cartagena de Indias.\r\n<p>\r\nShe sells fish while her husband works as a carpenter.  Therefore, she has two reasons why she is applying for a loan worth 2,000,000 COP.  She plans to buy a sufficient quantity of fish to sell during Holy Week as well as wood to make furniture requested by her husband\u2019s customers.  \r\n<p>\r\nAna started her business in 2001 when she bought a freezer.  She began with 200,000 COP of savings, which she accumulated coin by coin and kept in a piggy bank.  Ana was determined to sell her products even though she had no experience and had to deal with her mother\u2019s health problems and a child who left home.  Slowly she was able to move forward with her business and also support her husband with his carpentry, since he is well-known for his trade.  Ana decided to apply for a loan from the Foundation in order to strengthen both businesses at the same time by expanding them, especially the carpentry business since it had been in operation already for two years.  It is now the primary family business.\r\n<p>\r\n This is Ana\u2019s seventh loan with the Foundation. She began with a loan of 1,200,000 COP and has received as much as 2,800,000 COP.  Ana is grateful to the organization because it has helped to simultaneously support two family businesses that have grown since receiving the first loan.  This has also improved her conditions at home and helped her son who has now started his own family.   \r\n<p>\r\nAna hopes that the carpentry business will grow so that she can work with it full-time.  At the moment, she supplements this work by selling fish and with a job working at a hotel to earn additional income.  She recognizes that her goal will be achieved when the carpentry business generates enough income to fully support her household.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva
