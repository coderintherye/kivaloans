H. M. is a young married man. His wife stays at home to take care of the household chores. They do not have any children yet. \r\n\r\nMwarua makes such things as cupboards from timber and then he sells them to the local people. He also sells timber to other carpenters within the area. His business is located at a residential area in Mombasa, Kenya. Mombasa is the coastal region of Kenya and is well known for its many, many tourist attraction sites as well as its Indian ocean white beaches. \r\n\r\nMwarua says that this business is profitable. His major challenge is that there are other people in the area with the same kind of business as his, and this ends up reducing prices due to competition. This, therefore, hinders profit maximization.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th century BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007 IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History: Since December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

In the urban setting, eggs are a protein food that is very affordable for the majority of people in the community, and for this reason he believes that it is a profitable business.\r\n\r\nHis main aim in the future is to grow his business and have a better standard of living.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":609857,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase more eggs to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Narok","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.516667 36.866667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":133,"posted_date":"2010-09-30T02:10:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jacob Saulo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.36}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":3333.33,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:59:26Z","rounded_local_amount":3368.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177439549,"comment":null},{"amount":41.66,"local_amount":3333.67,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:42:01Z","rounded_local_amount":3369.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182578845,"comment":null},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":3332.99,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:50:58Z","rounded_local_amount":3368.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188714081,"comment":null},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":3333.33,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:21:12Z","rounded_local_amount":3368.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191452479,"comment":null},{"amount":41.66,"local_amount":3333.33,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:59:59Z","rounded_local_amount":3368.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195874600,"comment":null},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":3333.33,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:27:52Z","rounded_local_amount":3368.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201315694,"comment":null},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":3333.33,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:26:36Z","rounded_local_amount":3368.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206184945,"comment":null},{"amount":41.66,"local_amount":3333.33,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-18T07:56:37Z","rounded_local_amount":3368.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211698384,"comment":null},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":3333.36,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-17T08:00:48Z","rounded_local_amount":3368.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216787938,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-09-30T18:27:57Z","paid_date":"2011-07-17T08:00:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":235596,"name":"Shazia Ibrar's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shazia is a seamstress by profession.

She also has a dairy business which she prefers. The reason for liking this business is because her parents are also in the same business and she used to take care of their cattle. Currently, she has a buffalo at her home which produces almost 8 kg of milk per day. She sells the milk to community members and uses this income to pay for the utilities expenses for her house. \r\n\r\nShe has applied for a loan from Kiva's partner, Asasah, for her dairy business. With the loan amount, she will buy another buffalo and increase her dairy business's productivity. Haneefan is a regular borrower from Asasah and this is her fifth loan application.

They were able to stock their business using the first few loans they received from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, an organization that has helped them make adjustments to their store, increase their sales, and provide an education for their children.  Amira\u2019s retail business is situated in a good location, but this is not the only activity in which she is involved.  She also prepares turnovers, \u201carepas\u201d (flat cornbread stuffed with various fillings), and fried foods that many families consume for breakfast.  In addition, she offers telecommunication services from her store provided through SAI, which was the original product she provided through her business.  \r\n<p>\r\nAmira says she started her business because she did not want to perform household chores all day and then sit around with her arms crossed while waiting for her husband to bring home a paycheck.  She is a hard worker who wakes up at 4am to prepare the cornmeal.  By 6am, Amira and her mother begin selling fried foods.  Later in the day, she organizes the merchandise that her husband and an employee have to deliver to their customers.  They have two pushcarts that they use to transport goods through the streets of Soledad.  Amira has more than 500 customers, so she has to prepare the same number of invoice cards that state the customer\u2019s name, the amount that has to be collected each week, and the list of products that have been delivered over the long term.  Her dream is to have several retail outlets and a large warehouse.  She currently wants to prepare for the year-end season when she sells more merchandise such as toys, small appliances, and clothing.  For this reason, she plans to use her Kiva loan to stock these items.  Her greatest challenge is the high level of competition in the area, so she wants to sell what her customers need.

naci\u00f3 cuando su hermana y cu\u00f1ado la visitaron en la ciudad de Bucaramanga, lugar donde Zurelly  trabajaba en una peluquer\u00eda para ni\u00f1os, al ver todo lo que ella sabia  respecto al

Anyone who has met her knows the look on her face inspires both tenderness and confidence, qualities that have helped her grow the customer base of her business called \u201cHappy Cuts and Styles for Little Heads\u201d.  The reason for her business is to promote children\u2019s self-image.  Zurelly started her business when her sister and brother-in-law visited her in the city of Burcaramanga, where she was working at a children\u2019s salon.  Since Zurelly knew everything about this type of business, her family suggested that she start her own establishment in the city of Barranquilla.  This would be a unique opportunity since a children\u2019s stylist did not exist in the area, so she decided to turn this idea into an innovative enterprise.\n\nZurelly says she gives credit to God and to her family for the chance to work together to make this idea a reality.  She and her three sisters started by teaching other employees how to work with them since finding qualified staff is a great challenge.  They must learn the techniques for establishing relationships, demonstrating patience, and being sensitive with their star clients, the children.  \n\nThis is her first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  Zurelly and her family have invested all of their savings so that they could move forward with their dream.  Their efforts have been invested in advertising because trying to draw publicity is not an easy task.  At the moment, Zurelly needs operating capital to diversify the services she offers.

They live in their own home located in the Peruvian jungle (in the Pumpuriani native community center).  Everyday, she goes to a small home on the side of her land; here, she can spend more time taking care of plants and her land.  Lorena grows coffee, banana, corn, and yucca; she has very little time because as soon as she finishes cleaning and fertilizing her land, she takes care of her chickens.  She has worked in agriculture for the last 30 years and she is very happy.  She enjoys the time she spends with her family.  She has purchased 4 blocks of banana fields where she would like to grow large amounts of bananas.  With this purchase, Violeta will have 5 blocks of coffee plants, and 4 blocks ready to be planted.  This is the 4th loan she will receive from MFP and she is grateful to the village bank since she has learned a lot in the classes that they offer.

Together with her husband she slaughters them and sells the meat by the pound to neighbors and other people of the village. She works every day in raising her little animals, about three hours a day.

Mr. Theary V. has been selling cows for over more than 20 years, buying them from his villagers and the nearby district for resale to a middleman who comes to buy them at his house.<p>\r\n\r\nHaving already benefited from one Kiva loan, Theary  hopes to continue expanding his business and better support his family. He is therefore applying for his second loan of $1,000 to purchase cows for resale.<p>\r\n\r\nMr. Theary V. was not available for the picture, so his wife is pictured. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":610267,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase cows for resale.

T. has been engaged in this business for over five years and earns approximately 3,600,000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, T. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  T. has successfully repaid a previous L. of 6,048,000 VND from SEDA.  This previous L. was used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale.  She is now requesting a new L. of 7,392,000 VND which will be used to invest in expanding the business.  The L. will be the third L. taken out by the borrower from SEDA.  T. plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve or expand the borrower's business.\r\n\r\nAbout the Other Borrowers in the Group:\r\n\r\n1.  L\u00ea Th\u1ecb H.

Hu\u1ec7 is the group leader for a five-member group loan offered by SEDA.  While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.  The official name of this borrowing group is Th\u00f4n \u0110o\u00e0i 1 - nh\u00f3m 05 (Nh\u00f3m 05).\r\n\r\n\r\nHu\u1ec7 is married and has two school-aged children.  To make a living, Hu\u1ec7 owns a tailoring business.  The main source of income for the business comes from providing specialty tailoring services to local community members.  Hu\u1ec7 has been engaged in this business for over four years and earns approximately 4.200.000 VND a month from it.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Hu\u1ec7 joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Hu\u1ec7 has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6.048.000 VND from SEDA.  This previous loan was used to purchase additional fabrics and materials.  She is now requesting a new loan of 7.392.000 VND, which will be used to purchase a new sewing machine.  The loan will be her fourth loan from SEDA.  Hu\u1ec7 plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to expand her business.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the Other Borrowers in the Group:\r\n\r\n\r\n1.  Ng\u00f4 Th\u1ecb S.

has run a livestock business for many years which he has used to support his large family.

Currently, Safarali needs to purchase more livestock in order to grow his business. Intelligently, he is seeking a loan from IMON International in order to acquire additional animalsfor his farm.  \r\n \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC, and communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language. Today it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to provide poor and low-income clients with a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC, and communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language. Today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to offer poor and low-income clients a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC, and communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language. Today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

His daily business revenue is between 18,000 and 35,000 MNT and his daily operating cost such as fuel for his car is 8,000 MNT. His wife sells a variety of vegetables that she grows in their own field, at an outdoor stall at the local market during the harvest season. Her daily sales revenue is between 15,000 and 30,000 MNT. This year, they harvested 600kg of potatoes, 500kg cabbages, 300kg of carrots and 50kg of beets. The continued growth of both businesses, transportation and vegetable trading, enabled them to decorate their house and helped them to improve their quality of life. \r\n\r\nSuhbold works hard and is a modest and open-minded person.

Sari-sari stores basically sell small quantities of various foodstuffs, grocery items and beverages. \u201cSari\u201d is a native Filipino word for variety. This is a small store that is either attached to the owner\u2019s house or in a small native cottage, not far away from the owner\u2019s house. Such stores are convenient for people in the village who lives far from the marketplace. \r\n\r\nJanice started her variety store through her initiative in dealing with customers. She wants to continue her business; it gives them good proceeds to support the education of her three children. She is requesting a loan of PHP18,000 so that she can have the funds needed to buy more food products and basic household necessities. This will allow her to attract more customers and increase her sales. With profit from her business, she wants to buy a hog for fattening for supplementary income. After four months of raising or fattening, pigs will be sold either alive or slaughtered for meat to be sold per kilo. Her long-term goal is to have her own restaurant someday, so that Janice will give the opportunity of employment to others. \r\n  \r\nJanice dreams of growing her variety store into a mini-grocery store and expanding it to another village, so as to send her three children all the way through college, and to have their own beautiful house and lot for comfortable living. Her three children are her inspiration to pursue her variety store. She now feels very happy about the service of ASHI and its KIVA partnership. It gives them a great possibility to pursue their family dreams. She hopes that they continue the service for a long time and help many families who want to get ahead.\r\n\r\nShe has shown herself to be hard-working to make her dreams come true and hopes that her

She has promised herself that she would work hard and teach good values to her children so that they will not suffer the same fate as she. \r\n\r\nGina is a very dynamic mother who has always dreamed of a bright future for her children. She joined Ahon sa Hirap, Inc., a partner MFI of KIVA in the Philippines, in 2006. She started selling fish in their community but now after several years her business has improved. She is applying for a loan of Php 20,000 to finance her now enlarged fish trading business. She will buy more fish and supply directly to fish vendors in the market. \r\n\r\nShe has already identified buyers and she is planning to market her fish in other towns and provinces. She is hoping that KIVA lenders will support her business plans so that she can generate more profit and be able to pay for her children\u2019s schooling. Her ultimate dream is to send her children up through college and see them earn a degree. \r\n\r\nNote: Please ignore the date on the picture; the setting on the camera is not properly adjusted.

Yairo has subsisted on a produce sales business for more than 4 years. He is a fledgling agro-sales business trend setter whose example is bound to stand out as a benchmark for other people in his home area of Nyaruharo, Rukungiri. Many in his area preoccupy themselves with self-destructive activities instead of working hard and taking on their family responsibilities. With his hard work ethic, R. Yairo has managed to take firm root, earning 250,000 UGX monthly. With his savings, he has managed to diversify his small business, selling coffee, beans, bananas and milk.

Afterwards she moved into women's garments, when she started to work in the town of Barranquilla and afterwards started her business of selling her own designs, sharing the workshop with her mother. Her main customers are the owners of department stores to whom she makes clothing for women, dresses and children's clothing, with the most delicate knittings that according to her only her mother knows how to do. Their shop consists of 4 machines and in the high season her sister and other employees work for her and she pays for their work. \r\n\r\nMaribel is a very organized and responsible person that managed to build her business with the guidance of the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation in conjunction with the Barranquilla chamber of commerce. She is always open to learning, and this is why she participates in the management training of this same organization, through which she has received six loans that have allowed her to increase her profits and generate jobs for her own family. She also managed to improve her quality of life and establish a credit history. With this credit she will buy cloth and raw material necessary to make elegant, feminine dresses for women and girls; as the holiday season is approaching she must prepare for this commercial event. Maribel dreams of moving, because she is close to the ocean and the land gets really muddy; whenever there is torrential rain there is no way to use the roads. Her biggest challenge is the humidity of the area, which forces her to give constant preventive maintenance to her machinery. To fulfill her dream of moving, she works persistently."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":741.39,"image":{"id":608437,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"buy

is part of the communal bank \u201c21 de Mayo \u2013 El Roble\u201d and resides in the city of Lota. Pedro has a stand located in the main streets of Lota, where he sells delightful sweets and children's crossword puzzle and word search books. Pedro's business sits in a commercial district area and is quite far from his home. Pedro's stand has no roof, so Pedro uses an umbrella to protect it from the sun and cover for the rain. Pedro has worked this stand for the past 15 years, but has worked in this type of business for the past 25 years.\r\n\r\nPedro started selling items in the street fairs and little by little he started working towards establishing the stand he holds today from Monday to Saturday. For many years, Pedro\u2019s wife has also run a stand, but of fruits and vegetables, in the street market.\r\n\r\nWith this loan Pedro will purchase merchandise, a new and larger umbrella and will send his stand-booth to get repaired. Pedro is a father of three; the two oldest sons are professionals and no longer reside with him. Pedro\u2019s youngest son just graduated from high school and is 18 years old; he still resides with Pedro and is looking for work to continue his studies. Pedro\u2019s goal is to support his son through his studies as he did with his older sons, thanks to his business and wife. \r\n\r\nThe entrepreneurial training offered by Kiva Partner Fondo Esperanza has been very helpful to Pedro, as he has improved his money management skills. Pedro is also grateful for his loan officer and the companionship of his other fellow group members. \r\n\r\nIn Mapudungun (the language of the indigenous Mapuche population), Lota means \"Humble Village\".

Balaring, Silay City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating three business ventures:  fishing, dried fish vending, and pig fattening. Her husband Virgilio J. Jr, who is 55 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have 4 children who are 27 to 33 years old.\r\n\r\nElizabeth joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 5 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Elizabeth has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 5,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 2,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 6th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000, which she intends to use to purchase bamboo and nets for her fishing business, so that she can continue improve her family's living conditions. Elizabeth J. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Overflow, Brgy. Hilamonan, Kabankalan City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating three business ventures: a general store, food vending and pig fattening businesses. Her husband, Manuel M., who is 55 years old, works as a sand and gravel contractor to earn his living. They have nine children who are 16 to 37 years old:  six of them already have their own families and the remaining three work to help support the family. \r\n\r\nBenita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2003 because she wanted something better for her family. With the help of her past 13 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, and by the sweat of her brow, Benita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty. Her previous loan of 22,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of 5,000 PHP, improving the family's standard of living. This time, for her 14th loan, she is borrowing 25,000 PHP, which she intends to use as additional working capital in her businesses so that she can continue to save up for the future security of her family and sustainability of her business. Benita M. is a <i>Dungganon<\/i> woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means <u>honorable<\/u>).

B. is a widow who lives in Prk. 5, Brgy. Batinguel, Dumaguete City, Negros Oriental. She earns her living by operating a general store.  \r\n\r\nLoreta joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2003 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 14 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Loreta has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 6,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 2,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 15th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 14,000, which she intends to use to pay for more stock to sell in her general store, so that she can continue to save up for future home repairs. Loreta B. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Her husband Santiago N. who is 30 years old works as a pedicab driver to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have five children who are 2 to  9 years old. \r\n\r\nJaneth joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2006 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 10 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Janeth has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 9000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4800,  uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 11th loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000, which she intends to use to buy more materials for her jewelry-making business and stock for her dry goods business so that she can continue to save up for future home repairs and to purchase a vehicle. Janeth N. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

She is a very happy and hardworking person. She lives together with Roberto, 40 years old, and they have three children together: Frank, 11 years old, Jean, 8 years old, and Derlis, 3 years old. They live in a rented house in the city of La Union Leticia. Every morning for the first few hours of the morning she participates in a support program promoted by the Peruvian government called \"Building Peru\". Through this program she cleans the streets of the neighborhood. The topography is varied, including rivers, sloping terrains, plains, hills and small mountains that impede transport to the region's inhabitants. Faustina works arduously to help the population of her district.  With great energy, in the afternoon she goes out to her plantations where for the last 20 years she has cultivated carrots, potatoes, corn, and lettuce. She later sells the harvest in the central market of her city (Tarma, Peru). What she most likes is to work together with her family out in the fields. For this reason she is saving her money to be able to be able to purchase her own home. This is her third loan with MFP and she is happy to be  part of her community bank, location where she finds happiness and progress.

Because of lack of capital she was only able to make the bare minimum variety.  Because many people sought her out, however, she decided to solicit a loan from a Communal Bank although it was difficult for her because she wasn\u2019t used to having debts.  However, facing the need to help her business grow she asked for 5000 quetzals and, thanks to God, earned good profits and became better known still for her delicious, fresh sweets.

She also wants her children to get ahead and attend the university so that they can become professionals and have good jobs later on.

He has an excellent location, surrounded by big state-owned and private companies, and on a main route where many people pass by on their way to the commercial centre. His idea for the business began 38 years ago, when he arrived in Barranquilla and started working for various companies. Eventually he responded to his independent streak and put into action his dream of having a small business preparing delicious natural orange juice. With this business he has succeeded in providing for his family and contributing, along with his wife, who is employed in domestic service, to the education of his three children who are now aged between 23 and 30. Above all, he has succeeded in keeping their own roof over their heads. Sixto's Kiva loan is his first loan with field partner Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, an organisation that was recommended to him by a friend who is also a client of the field partner. With the money he will buy oranges and also raw materials, in bulk, for making fries, which he would like ot add as a new product in his range. At the same time he will pay off other loans that have become very costly. Sixto's main goal is to help his wife sert up a shop  in thier home, where she will be able to earn money for the family's expenses so she can become independent and not have to keep working as a maid. The main challenge in his business is inclement weather, especially when it rains. This reduces the number of customers and his sales, because as an outdoor salesman he has to take shelter.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":610784,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"To buy oranges and ingredients in bulk for making fries, and also to repay a costly, informally arranged, debt.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2010-10-05T20:10:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sixto Tom\u00e0s","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":800000,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":72317},{"due_date":"2010-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":74726},{"due_date":"2011-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":76158},{"due_date":"2011-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":77618},{"due_date":"2011-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":79105},{"due_date":"2011-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":80622},{"due_date":"2011-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":82167},{"due_date":"2011-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":83742},{"due_date":"2011-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":85347},{"due_date":"2011-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":88198}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.68},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.03},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.84},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.66},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.35},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.22},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.1},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.01},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.61}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":82.71,"local_amount":147043,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:08:34Z","rounded_local_amount":149211.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182550783,"comment":null},{"amount":86.5,"local_amount":153776,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:38:58Z","rounded_local_amount":156044.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191427610,"comment":null},{"amount":44.5,"local_amount":79105,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-16T08:40:23Z","rounded_local_amount":80271.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196001031,"comment":null},{"amount":45.35,"local_amount":80622,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:09:10Z","rounded_local_amount":81811.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201289042,"comment":null},{"amount":46.22,"local_amount":82167,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:05:02Z","rounded_local_amount":83378.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206157192,"comment":null},{"amount":47.1,"local_amount":83742,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:08:46Z","rounded_local_amount":84977.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216509072,"comment":null},{"amount":48.01,"local_amount":85347,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:49:35Z","rounded_local_amount":86605.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221673299,"comment":null},{"amount":49.61,"local_amount":88198,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:02:16Z","rounded_local_amount":89498.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227319863,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-10-06T17:53:33Z","paid_date":"2011-09-17T08:02:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":236036,"name":"Mercedes Marinelly","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Picoaza consta en los libros como uno de los pueblos abor\u00edgenes parte de la cultura mante\u00f1a, esta parroquia urbana situada a tan solo diez minutos de la ciudad de Portoviejo capital manabita est\u00e1 llena de muchas historias aqu\u00ed se re\u00fanen cada quince d\u00edas las socias del Banco Comunal Mar\u00eda Asunci\u00f3n.\n\nLa se\u00f1ora Mercedes es socia del Banco Comunal hace ya siete a\u00f1os y le gusta mucho por la labor social que realizan.
