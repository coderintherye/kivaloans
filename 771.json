She has a business in which she sells blankets that she started years ago. \r\n\r\nThe loan which she is currently requesting is to increase her capital, for the purchase of blankets that she will buy in Ceja and later will resell them in her market stall. This business allows her to make income, to be able to support her family. She is married and has two children. \r\n\r\nWhen she was asked what she likes about 'Pro Mujer' she said she likes the area of health. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":988843,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Knitting","sector":"Arts","use":"Compra de mantas","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz  \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2012-01-25T18:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-24T18:00:03Z","loan_amount":3475,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Estela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eva\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francisca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teodora Magdalena\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cristina Pamela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angelica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eulogia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Raquel Gisela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":23737.35,"loan_amount":3475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":2373.8},{"due_date":"2012-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2373.8},{"due_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2373.8},{"due_date":"2012-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2373.8},{"due_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2373.8},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2373.8},{"due_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":2373.8},{"due_date":"2012-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2373.8},{"due_date":"2012-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2373.8},{"due_date":"2012-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2373.15}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":347.51},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":347.51},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":347.51},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":347.51},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":347.51},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":347.51},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":347.51},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":347.51},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":347.51},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":347.41}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-01-28T18:12:35Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":384074,"name":"Abdulrazaq","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Abdulrazaq is 28 years old, a married man with two children.

To support her large family Jyldyzkan opened a grocery store in 1995. With a starting capital of 5,000 som (KGS) and a lot of hard work and perseverance Jyldyzkan expanded her business to yield 5,000 som (KGS) monthly profits.

","en":"Saltanat is 46 years old, married and is raising three children.  In 2006, in search of an income source for her family, she started her own business of selling office and household goods, using a sum of 10,000 som (KGS) as an initial capital.  Traveling to a market to sell their merchandise, Saltanat and her husband put forth all their efforts to develop this business and achieved success.  Today, they have a goods turnover of about 50,000 som (KGS).  Currently, the goods selection is limited, and this is why Saltanat requested a loan in the sum of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company.  Purchasing merchandise will allow her to expand the goods selection, increase the number of customers and increase sales.

She has been doing this for 4 years and as of yet has not complained about the income that this activity generates.  She likes this business because it allows her to bring in additional income to cover expenses and also feel busy and as a business woman with strong desires to get ahead.  When her car breaks down, however, it brings her many expenses instead of income, this does not upset her because she can count on the other income with which she can support herself.  This will be loan # 5 with MFP, and she looks for its support so that she can continue with her goals.  She feels good about her community bank and feels that they are good people.  The loan amount of 1000 soles she will invest in the planting of her oil palm product and contract laborers.     \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":116.03,"image":{"id":989515,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to contract laborers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-01-26T00:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-25T00:20:05Z","loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lola ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":149.88},{"due_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":159.53},{"due_date":"2012-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":158.92},{"due_date":"2012-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":171.42},{"due_date":"2012-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":177.81},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":182.44}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.21},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.82},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.59},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.29},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.68},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.41}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":56.21,"local_amount":149.88,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:18:32Z","rounded_local_amount":151.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257246322,"comment":null},{"amount":59.82,"local_amount":159.53,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:30:27Z","rounded_local_amount":161.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263386334,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-26T05:11:23Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":383900,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"","en":""}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":56.21,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Property","sector":"Housing","use":"to buy materials to build more rooms","delinquent":true,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-01-26T00:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-25T00:20:05Z","loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":149.88},{"due_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":159.53},{"due_date":"2012-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":158.92},{"due_date":"2012-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":171.42},{"due_date":"2012-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":177.81},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":182.44}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.21},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.82},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.59},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.29},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.68},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.41}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":56.21,"local_amount":149.88,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:19:20Z","rounded_local_amount":151.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257246324,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-27T21:46:27Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":384857,"name":"Aida","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Aida lives in the city of Kampala, Uganda.

She has four children ranging in age from 9 to 18. She lives with her husband and she's a very hardworking woman. She sells breakfasts and lunches in a place located in the wholesale square of the public market of Los Pl\u00e1tanos. She has been doing this for five years, although her experience dates back eight years. That's when she, along with her husband, began selling corncob rolls from her own home, with very little working capital. Through their hard work, perseverance and work discipline, they succeeded in expanding the business into a rented spot at the commercial aisle in the market. Everlides still wishes to have the business grow and to keep on improving her facilities, but her working capital is insufficient for achieving her goals. This is the reason why she turns to credikiva, her first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. With it she will purchase supplies for food making, fix the kitchen counter and repair the fridge where she stores meat products. Her first customers were neighbors and local customers, and after she expanded into the spot where she is currently located, she gets customers such as the salespeople from both the formal and informal retail businesses around her. She has been getting along with them very well and for that reason she stayed there, expanded the business and now she has two employees under her supervision. Meanwhile, her husband distributes goods in the villages of the municipality of the Atlantic deparment, where he also has been doing well because he has been well-received by a large clientele."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":35.11,"image":{"id":988570,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase supplies for food making, to fix the kitchen counter and to repare the fridge where she stores meat products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-01-26T01:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-25T01:50:02Z","loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Everlides Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":63839},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":74662},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":76404},{"due_date":"2012-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":78187},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":80011},{"due_date":"2012-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":81878},{"due_date":"2012-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":83789},{"due_date":"2012-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":85744},{"due_date":"2012-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":87745},{"due_date":"2012-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":89792},{"due_date":"2013-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":91887},{"due_date":"2013-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":106062}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.11},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.07},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.02},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.01},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.03},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.08},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.16},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.26},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.39},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.54},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":35.11,"local_amount":63839,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:35:25Z","rounded_local_amount":64043.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263325139,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-26T15:26:51Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":383903,"name":"Liz","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Liz, de 24 a\u00f1os es una mujer sencilla.

He is married to Helen, a housewife and mother to their only child. Ronald, together with his wife, manages their own household while operating the business. At this time, he is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nRonald operates a junk shop. Trash is not actively segregated in the Philippines, and while waiting for their local dump trucks, people scavenge garbage dumps and trash bags for recyclable materials like metal, copper, plastic, paper, and other materials. They sell these to junk shops like Ronald's for a little profit. Junk shops then stack, clean, and gather huge quantities of these materials and sell them back to foundries like factories and others of the like. Ronald's regular customers are from the local community. He earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help him continue the operation of his business, he is requesting a loan of 8,000 PHP. He will be incorporating the loan into his current revolving fund to buy recyclable materials from collectors. He expects a boost in his business income as he expands his business. \r\n\r\nRonald hopes his business grows more in the coming years. He faithfully meets up with his co-fellowship* members to share stories of his work every week and also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God he studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":80,"image":{"id":992170,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Recycled Materials","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase scrap materials needed in his business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Tanza, Cavite","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-01-26T03:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-25T03:30:02Z","loan_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ronald","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":533.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":26.67,"local_amount":1067,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:48:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1151.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257146189,"comment":null},{"amount":53.33,"local_amount":2132.98,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:00:58Z","rounded_local_amount":2300.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263275432,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-26T06:23:09Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":385077,"name":"Marlyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marlyn is a married woman with four children.

In the beginning, it was complicated since she had to learn how to keep the fish fresh and in the process she lost a large investment. However, with time she learned how to maintain them fresh and is doing much better. In the future, she hopes to have a refrigerator to keep her fish fresh and not have to worry about them rotting. This will be her third loan with MFP. She is very happy in knowing that she will have financial support since she will have more confidence growing her business.

Fulgencio Genoveva plans to use it to purchase wafers, bags and masking tape at wholesale. Lorena Rosalba is 32 years old, has a third-grade education and is married with three children, two boys and a girl, who are all in school. She makes wafers and is requesting the loan to purchase flour, oil, paint, bags and masking tape to have the necessary materials to continue working. She started the business 16 years ago while watching her husband also make wafers so he could buy machinery to do farm work. Her business is important because it supplies resources and gives her daily work. She is proud to make wafers. In her community almost everyone makes a living in this business. She is happy about the loan so she can stock up on supplies. Her hopes and dreams are to keep working so she keeps receiving orders and for her children to keep studying. The members of the group want to tell Kiva and Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad, \"We thank you for the loans and we hope you keep supporting us.

There she has a stand where she sells flowers and in small boxes arranges her roses, carnations, and violets. She works alone since with the passage of the years has learned how to give herself time to do almost everything. She likes her job a lot because she enjoys having conversations with other sellers and also likes to offer her flowers to different people who come to visit their family member's tombs and mausoleums.

Isma\u00ebl did not get the chance to progress in his studies, and about seven years ago, he learned how to get involved in the business of buying and selling flower pots and kitchen utensils.  He sells these items in a shop located in the new market of M\u00e9dine, in Sikasso.  His customers come from all socioeconomic groups.  He is a very popular seller, thanks to the quality of his products.  In order to better satisfy an ever-increasing number of customers, he decided to join the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso about a year ago.  He was granted a loan which was properly repaid.  In order to further enhance his business, he is requesting a second loan which will allow him to buy 20 boxes of flower pots (of various brands), 3 boxes of aluminum cups, 5 boxes of plates, 2 dozen spoons and 2 dozen forks.  He will buy these items in Bamako.  He is expecting monthly profits to reach 200,000 CFA francs, part of which will be used to contribute to his family's expenses, pay off his loan's interests, while the rest will be invested in his business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":80,"image":{"id":992487,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy various retail items.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2012-01-26T10:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-25T10:50:03Z","loan_amount":800,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Isma\u00ebl ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":400000,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2012-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2012-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2012-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2012-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2012-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2012-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2012-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":40000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":80,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2012-02-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T11:00:52Z","rounded_local_amount":40304.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263424855,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-28T22:30:26Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":385132,"name":"Nandintsetseg","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Nandintsetseg, 31, is a secondary school teacher in Darkhan, the second largest city in Mongolia.

He is married and has a 10 year old child who attends sprimary school. He and his family live in the center of the city of Santo Domingo which is the fourth most populous city in Ecuador after Guayaquil, Quito and Cuenca. Its population is growing rapidly because it has a rich trade sector and the largest cattle market in the country. The province is 3857 km \u00b2 in area and has an average temperature of about 25.5 \u00b0C which sometimes reaches 38 \u00b0C. The whole province of \"Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas\" appears as part of the mountainous territory of the coast of the western mountain range, historically known as Yumbos Province and Capital de los Colibr\u00edes (capital of the hummingbirds). Located in the humid tropics of Latin America, this province is considered new since it was created in 2007.\r\n\r\nJorge has had a stall selling casual clothes for several years. He learned the trade from his relatives. He works alone as his wife spends all her time taking care of their child and the household chores. He works 10 hours a day approximately. He wants to invest in more merchandise and in this way take advantage of the Christmas season during which sales are the highest in the year. He is thinking of buying clothes to increase his stock and thus offer his customers more options to secure the sale. This is his first loan and he feels very optimistic. Although prices have increased and his profit margin has beeen affected, Jorge believes that with this investment he can make good profits again.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":159.26,"image":{"id":962928,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy merchandise.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santo Domingo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2011-12-27T13:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-25T13:50:04Z","loan_amount":1075,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jorge Geovanny","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1067.2,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":76.64},{"due_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":81.46},{"due_date":"2012-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":84.17},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":84.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":86.77},{"due_date":"2012-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":87.99},{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":90.05},{"due_date":"2012-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":91.44},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":93.21},{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":95.2},{"due_date":"2012-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":96.86},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":98.74}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.2},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.06},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.78},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.29},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.4},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.64},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.71},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.1},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.89},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.9},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.57},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.46}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":159.26,"local_amount":158.1,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-19T07:44:09Z","rounded_local_amount":159.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263316994,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-02T19:38:00Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":375462,"name":"Luis Alberto","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Luis de 33 a\u00f1os de edad vive en el municipio de Puerto Colombia, a orillas del mar con su esposa y su hijo de 6 a\u00f1os de edad; \u00e9l tiene una tienda salsamentar\u00eda con la que genera el ingreso de su hogar y est\u00e1 ubicada al norte de la Ciudad de Barranquilla.

Aroldo plans to buy 2 washings machines and also invest more in ingredients and raw materials for the preparation of cakes and hayacas, products that have an increased consumption in the year-end holidays, which is why they want to take advantage and earn a little more money than usual.

In the Philippines, the whole working community and most families only eat home-cooked meals during the evenings when all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons, when buying cooked rice and other prepared foods cost less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php30,000 loan.

","en":"Soatmoh is a 43 year-old woman, who is married and is a mother of four children.  She is a master of her craft - a seamstress of women's dresses.  She previously sewed at home and now leases work space, where she and her apprentices sew to-order.

This large family lives in a house of their own located in the Zona Patria community, Chanchamayo Province.\n\nMarcelina is an enterprising woman.  Her main economic activity is farming.  Since her youth she\u2019s worked at this demanding occupation but she feels happy because everything she obtains is the fruit of her sweat and it\u2019s all for her children\u2019s education.  In restitution for so much affection, her children help her with the field work.  F\u00e9lix, her spouse, also exhibits willingness and desire when the time to plant comes. Marcelina owns nine fields but only produces on four of them; she gets 30 sacks of coffee from that area.\n\nNot satisfied with just that, she also installed a store at home.  She has photocopiers, telephone booths, printers and a computer there.  She thus provides printing, word processing and papers and documents photocopying.  She is happy with what she does.\n\nThrough her untiring work she educates her children and provides them with proper living conditions.  She can\u2019t complain.

She has been working in this field for 13 years and she does it along with her partner Carlos.  She feels very good about her work since it permits her to have a good income as well as to work at home and see and care for her children as she desires.  At first when she started the business she only did repairs, but with time the clients started leaving their own items for her to sell.  Now things are going well since the business generates good income.  For that reason she wants to purchase more used items in order to repair them and get them working.

They are handmade with corn dough and wrapped in corn husks and cooked or boiled.  They are traditional and deeply rooted in the Caribbean coast of Colombia, where they are prepared and sold on the street by street vendors.  Among them are women, with their unmistakable hawking, who are gradually being helped by loans and are achieving the growth of their businesses.  They also get customers from stores in the neighborhood and stationary informal businesses outside or inside supermarkets.\r\n\r\nThis tradition came to be part of the daily chores of Ana, who is of Palenque ancestry and tradition.  [Palenque is a Spanish Creole language.]  She learned it from her mother and later got her best experience helping her sisters, who worked in the same business independently once their mother died.  Currently, although they still work in the family home, they have their own families and work together, each one with her own customers, to support their households.\r\n\r\nAna is an enterprising woman who relies on her nephews for producing and distributing the rolls in six stores and one restaurant.  She sells on credit in the morning and collects her money in the evening.\r\n\r\nAna finished high school and took degree courses in computer science and industrial machine operation.

He lives in Nazca, a city characterized by its hot climate and the majestic Nazca Lines which draw countless tourists. Luis, like a good Peruvian, likes food. His favourite dish is the rich Adobo de Pollo. Luis studied until the fifth grade of secondary school, but he would have liked to study civil engineering. Luis lives with his partner, and they have a little four-year-old who is in primary school.\r\nLuis currently works as a bricklayer, building homes and other buildings. He works approximately eight hours a week and is able to serve one or two clients per day. He works hard, and he believes that it is going very well for him because he does good work, and because he goes door to door and to construction sites to offer his services. Clients know him and recommend his services.\r\nLuis is very grateful to the Kiva lenders, since thanks to your help he will be able to build a room.

Currently she has a knitted goods business that she has been working at for some time.\r\n\r\nThe loan she is requesting is to expand her capital to buy wool which she will acquire wholesale from La Ceja and later knit and sell at her sales stall. This kind of work enables her to generate earnings to support her family since she lives with her partner and has three children.\r\n\r\nWhen asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, she responded that she enjoys the training.\r\n\r\nIn the photo Sra. Yhovana is missing because she had to see a doctor. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":785.01,"image":{"id":988708,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Knitting","sector":"Arts","use":"to purchase wool.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz  \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2012-01-27T00:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-26T00:20:03Z","loan_amount":3925,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tomasa\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jerson Felipe","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leydi Tatiana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alian","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jhenny","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Antonieta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paola Ruth\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Magaly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yhovana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Maria Hilda\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Cistina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":26767.65,"loan_amount":3925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":5353.57},{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":5353.57},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":5353.57},{"due_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":5353.57},{"due_date":"2012-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":5353.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":785.01},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":785},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":785.01},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":785},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":784.98}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":785.01,"local_amount":5353.57,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:52:59Z","rounded_local_amount":5385.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263418170,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-27T23:21:20Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":375791,"name":"Maritza Del Carmen","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Maritza, se ha decidido por un nuevo pr\u00e9stamo era la compra de mercader\u00eda agregando m\u00e1s rubros al negocio como son pl\u00e1sticos, focos, carteras, para diversificar el negocio y ofrecer al cliente mayor mercader\u00eda, la intenci\u00f3n de ella es que sus clientes puedan encontrar varias clases de productos para generar m\u00e1s ventas.\nElla considera que estos pr\u00e9stamos le han ayudado a superarse tanto ella como su familia, adquiriendo mayor experiencia y obteniendo mayores ganancias.\n","en":"Maritza has decided to apply for a new loan.
