He has found that he can make a good income from this career, so he would like to continue and make it better.  \r\n\r\nShe would like to send all of her children to school until they finish high school. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":664,"image":{"id":792448,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"To buy a motorbike and a carriage.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Takeo province","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":9,"posted_date":"2011-06-21T15:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Heang","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2011-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2011-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2011-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2011-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2011-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2012-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2012-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":87}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-16T07:59:21Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221813822,"comment":null},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2011-08-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-19T07:56:53Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227529884,"comment":null},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-19T07:57:33Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":233327617,"comment":null},{"amount":166,"local_amount":166,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-21T09:09:08Z","rounded_local_amount":166,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":239509918,"comment":null},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:39:26Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250825463,"comment":null},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:07:49Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257235526,"comment":null},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:18:23Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263374823,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-06-22T06:51:09Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":307606,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":""}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":349.44,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Rickshaw","sector":"Transportation","use":"To add to the money the borrower has and buy a rickshaw.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He would like to get a loan of 5,000 TJS to increase his working capital and expand his business. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country has produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. It is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Today it is home to a complex mix of Islam, Soviet culture, western culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet Republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve the country's agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Manuela's husband is a motorcycle taxi driver and they both contribute to the financial progress of their household.\r\n\r\nManuela is requesting a loan for 3,000 Peruvian soles from Edpyme Alternativa to put together with some savings that she and her husband have made, so that they can buy a motorcycle taxi (a motorbike with a cabin in back for transporting passengers) that her husband will use to provide a public transport service as, right now, he rents his vehicle.\r\n\r\nManuela is a very responsible client as she repaid her previous loan from us without a single day's delay.  This investment will allow her family to make progress financially."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":792853,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","use":"to buy a motorcycle taxi","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chep\u00e9n, La Libertad","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2011-07-03T13:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Manuela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":209.85},{"due_date":"2011-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":213.6},{"due_date":"2011-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":223.55},{"due_date":"2011-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":223.05},{"due_date":"2011-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":242.55},{"due_date":"2011-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":243.7},{"due_date":"2011-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":250.05},{"due_date":"2012-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":263.2},{"due_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":268.9},{"due_date":"2012-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":277.9},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":288.45},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":295.2}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.95},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.32},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.96},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.79},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.93},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.36},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.69},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.6},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.9},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.76},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.24}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":155.27,"local_amount":423.45,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-19T07:45:18Z","rounded_local_amount":428.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":222206032,"comment":null},{"amount":81.96,"local_amount":223.55,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-16T08:02:20Z","rounded_local_amount":226.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227182796,"comment":null},{"amount":81.79,"local_amount":223.05,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:46:27Z","rounded_local_amount":225.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232779749,"comment":null},{"amount":88.93,"local_amount":242.55,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:46:50Z","rounded_local_amount":245.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238584300,"comment":null},{"amount":89.36,"local_amount":243.7,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:42:04Z","rounded_local_amount":246.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244542477,"comment":null},{"amount":91.69,"local_amount":250.05,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-02T09:05:00Z","rounded_local_amount":253.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250752997,"comment":null},{"amount":96.5,"local_amount":263.2,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-01T09:00:28Z","rounded_local_amount":266.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257395030,"comment":null},{"amount":414.5,"local_amount":1130.45,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:12:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1144.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263290460,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-07-15T10:59:11Z","paid_date":"2012-03-15T09:12:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":307813,"name":"Danaire","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Donaire is 27 years old and lives in Tegucigalpa, Honduras with his wife.

When she was younger, she would work in the fields with her parents because Narcisa Elizabeth was the only help they had.

He drives his own car and earns approximately 500 Laris per month. Recently, the number of customers has decreased because he has had to charge higher prices for his service because of the petrol price increase. Not many villagers can afford to use the taxi service at a higher price. Because of the abovementioned problem, Valiko has decided to change his taxi's fuel system from petrol to gas, which is cheaper than petrol and will reduce the cost of transportation by 40 to 45 per cent.

As an enterprising woman, she is proud to be able to be the head of her family.  She spends the greater part of the day taking care of her children and working her land.  She has been growing potatoes and vegetables for 20 years.\r\n\r\nWhat she likes the most about her work is being able to see how the plants develop.  Selling all of her productions depends upon the growth of her plants.  She usually sells in the market in her city.

That way she will have stock for the customers she usually has in the capital.  That is where she travels to sell her production.  She is currently employing techniques to increase her sales.  Therefore, she hopes for support from each one of you so that she can carry out her proposal of buying farmland.  That way she will get greater income, which will allow her to provide her children with the quality of life that they deserve.\r\n\r\nShe belongs to the Los \u00c1ngeles de Llanco Communal Bank.

You might best characterize him as a loving father.  He lives in a house that he owns with his wife, Rina, 25, and their much-loved daughter, Abigail, 3.  Roland works hard for Abigail.  He's been a farmer all his life, learning to care for the land and living on what he grows from an early age.  He grows potatoes, maize, beans and peas.  He gets up every morning to take care of his crop because he depends on good harvests to support his family.  He sells what he grows at the central market at Tarma because that's where he can get the best price for his crop.  The thing that Roland likes best about farming is harvesting the land because that's when the months of hard work pay off.  He's worked the farm for 15 years and his biggest challenge is fertilizing his land because the job takes days and even weeks to finish.  His wife sometimes helps him, but she spends most of her day caring for their cows, milking them and making cheese from the milk.  Roland sells the milk and cheese products in the cities of Palca and Tarma because there's a big demand for them in those places.  For the future, he wants to increase his income by improving his harvests and investing in better cows for his milk and cheese business.  Roland belongs to the Los Pinos de Antabamba community bank and this is his sixth MFP loan.  He's grateful for the loans because they help him advance his business.  He is committed to repaying this loan in the agreed-upon time, just as he's repaid past loans.  He also wants to thank the members of his community bank for being responsible and supportive of one another.  Roland will use this loan to buy a Holstein cow which, on average, cost two thousand new soles.  He will also buy sacks of an organic manure, called Mamalucha, to fertilize his potato crop\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":793169,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy a cow and supplies for his farming and livestock business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-06-18T17:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":925,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rolando ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":925}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2011-06-19T12:21:48Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":307922,"name":"Yadira Agustina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"En la parroquia Quiroga de la  ciudad de Calceta, localidad donde la gente dedicada  en gran parte a la agricultura y cr\u00eda de  animales, se re\u00fane cada quince d\u00edas  El Banco Comunal Quiroga.\n\nEn este lugar conocimos a la se\u00f1ora Yadira, tiene 32 a\u00f1os de edad y mantiene una relaci\u00f3n de uni\u00f3n libre de la cual ha  procreado dos hijos de 12 y 3  a\u00f1os de edad, el mayor de sus hijos estudia en colegio.

He is noted for being a very simple and hard-working father.  He lives in his own home together with his wife, 57 year-old Julia, and his three dependent children who he looks after with a lot of dedication.\r\n\r\nIgnacio's arduous workdays on his farm have helped him to improve his family's economic situation.  He and his wife are responsible for looking after their children's well-being and so they work as hard as they can, growing potatoes, peas, beans, corn and other vegetables.  They then take their produce to sell in the wholesale market in the city of Tarma.\r\n\r\nWhat Ignacio most enjoys about his work is caring for his crops since he knows that healthy produce fetches a better price.  He has been in this business for 12 years and he considers the hardest part of his work to be having to climb the steep hills of Antabamba which is where he has his farmland.\r\n\r\nIgnacio has support from his wife who buys and sells cattle.  She fattens them up and then sells them on for a higher price.  In the future, Ignacio hopes to improve his farm and sow all of his land.\r\n\r\nIgnacio is a member of the \"Los Pinos de Antabamba\" (The Pine Trees of Antabamba) community bank and this is his sixth loan from MFP.
