M. lives in the Rudaki region. She is 40 years old, married, and has 2 children. She is in the business of cattle breeding and agriculture. These are the main sources of income for her family. Agricultural activities tend to be seasonal, so for this reason she is asking for loan to finance her cattle business. She plans to purchase a milk cow at a low price as in February they tend to drop down due to lack of food. This will give her an opportunity to get a good price and continuously have milk for both her family and for sales. She plans to pay off the loan within 12 months.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Russian by Vasilisa Budnikova, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\u041c\u0430\u0445\u043c\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430

Kanjaeva lives in the Rudaki Region. She is 45 years old, married, and has 3 kids. She is in the business of cattle breeding: she buys animals at a low price and resells them at a higher price. This loan will be used for her business. She plans to purchase 2 young bulls at a low price because during this time of the year the prices go down due to lack of food for these animals. This will give her an opportunity to earn a higher margin by selling the bulls during the spring season at a better price. She plans to pay off the loan within 12 months.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Russian by Vasilisa Budnikova, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\u041a\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0436\u0430\u0435\u0432\u0430

has sufficient experience and is a scholar at his trade. He has been in the animal husbandry business for the past six years. His family helps him take care of the livestock. The cow house is located on a wide farm-yard near his house. <p>\r\nHis current business is very stable and has a good capital turnover. His business consists of buying, feeding and growing and then selling of cattle. The profits grow more with each month and he uses part of the profits to support his family and the rest to reinvest into his business to buy fodder for the cattle. As you can see on the photo, the cow house is a bit small and Akmal wants to build a new one. In the future, he wants to increase the number of livestock, but there's a small problem with the premises. A credit counselor advised him to apply for a loan with Kiva. He hopes to receive a loan soon and promises that he will pay it off within 10 months.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Elena Fedorchuk, Kiva

She runs a grocery store, making about $30,000 Ugandan shillings (the equivalent of $27 U.S. dollars) each week. In order to meet her basic needs, including maintaining her home and paying for her children's school fees, Rehema hopes to buy more stock so she can grow her business. <p>\r\n\r\nRehema has applied for a loan of $1,600 U.S. dollars along with four other women. Rehama has taken out a loan before and paid it back on time, so she is confident that she will be able to repay this one as well. In this type of group loan, the money is divided among each woman to invest in her own business. They guarantee each other's loans, so that if one woman can't repay it, the others will cover her share. With her portion, Betty K. will buy equipment for her beauty salon, and  Harriet B. will start a retail shop.

She makes a living by running a poultry business in Kamuli, Uganda, and wishes to buy more merchandise to expand her store. Currently, she earns $25,0000 Ugandan shillings, or $12 U.S. dollars, each week; with the extra profits, she plans on covering basic needs like shelter. <p>\r\n\r\nMonic has applied for a loan of $1,300 U.S. dollars along with three other women. In this type of group loan, the money is divided among each woman to invest in her own business. They guarantee each other's loans, so that if one woman can't repay it, the others will cover her share. Veronica M. wishes to grow her retail store, while Jackie N. hopes to expand her sweet potato company. With her portion, Olivia N. wants to buy a poultry feeder for her poultry business.

However, she has always been brought face to face with the lack of financial means to undertake a large economic endeavor. Upon her husband\u2019s retirement, the family moved to Ouelessebougou, not far from the premises of the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso.

She stocks up on the local markets of Dankassa, Sankama, Keleya, Selingu\u00e9, Faraba, Sidoba and of Ouelessebougou. She carries out a market survey before going to Bamako and selling to wholesalers. Her profit margin is on average 3.000 FCFA (~USD 6) per bag. Her monthly profit is 150.000 FCFA (~USD 333).
