Little by little, she started to build up her clientele until she had a steady customer base and was able to offer a variety of products. <p>\r\nWithout a doubt, Mar\u00eda thinks that it is necessary to move ahead and find a better future for her children. Thus, she is seeking a loan of $475 which will be repaid in installments over 6 months.  The loan will be used to buy more merchandise for product demos; this will enable her to attract more customers to buy her products.  With your help, Mar\u00eda will be able to grow her business as well as increase possibilities for self-improvement for her two sons. \r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b> Translated from Spanish by Geraldine Kim, Kiva Translator. <\/b><\/p>\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda del Rosario es una mujer que lucha constantemente por sus dos hijos que tanto quiere, y desea que salgan adelante en la vida a base de estudios.

She is retired from the work force due to her health condition. In 2003, after learning a bit about TYM fund, she decided to become a member because she found that it would suit her situation. She applied for  a loan  to open up a  stationary\/souvenir store.  In the beginning she did not have enough inventory so sales were low. After a while, she started getting more and more customers as she used her loan to add more products. She has a lot of students as customers. The office stationary items are good seller but the best ones are souvenir and gift items. Her business is going well, there are always customers in her store. The revenue from the store is quite stable. Ms T\u00ecnh always participates in group activities organized by TYM despite the fact that she is very busy with her store. Her 2 children are attending university. This time she requests a loan of 325 USD to invest into her store, thus to raise her income.\r\n\r\n<P><B>Translated from Vietnamese by Khang Ho-Si, Kiva volunteer.<P><\/b>\r\n\r\nC\u00f4 L\u1ea1i Th\u1ecb T\u00ecnh, 55 tu\u1ed5i, l\u00e0 m\u1ed9t c\u00f4ng nh\u00e2n v\u1ec1 ngh\u1ec9 m\u1ea5t s\u1ee9c.

She has many children, but she earned her living solely from a couple acres of rice-field.  In August 2002, Mr.s H. joined TYM Fund.  With her initial loan of 60USD, she buy and raise pigs.  Years after years, she has becomes more confident with her ability to manage the loan.  With her experience and self confidence, Mrs. H. is applying for a loan of 750USD.  She wants to use this money to buy pigs, soybean to make tofu and mash to make wine.  She just bought a machine to make tofu, so her production has increased significantly (On average, she sells 30 to 50 kilogram tofu per day).  Mrs. H. uses by-products from making wine to feed her pigs.  Every year she sells 4 litters of pigs (which weigh about 2 to 3 tons).  Her husband is a farmer.  He often helps her with her job, so she can have time to participate in her cluster activities as well as other hamlet and commune activities in general.  Everybody in her commune trusts and respects her.  Mrs. H. was appointed one of TYM\u2019s best entrepreneurs in 2006.  She hopes to continue to be member of TYM Fund, so that she can have bigger loan to expand her business. \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Vietnamese by Phuong Nguyen, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nTr\u01b0\u1edbc n\u0103m 2002, \u0111i\u1ec1u ki\u1ec7n gia \u0111\u00ecnh ch\u1ecb Tr\u1ea7n Th\u1ecb H\u1eadu g\u1eb7p nhi\u1ec1u kh\u00f3 kh\u0103n, nh\u00e0 \u0111\u00f4ng con, ngo\u00e0i l\u00e0m m\u1ea5y s\u00e0o ru\u1ed9ng ra gia \u0111\u00ecnh ch\u1ecb c\u0169ng kh\u00f4ng bi\u1ebft l\u00e0m g\u00ec th\u00eam n\u00ean cu\u1ed9c s\u1ed1ng \u0111\u00e3 kh\u00f3 kh\u0103n l\u1ea1i c\u00e0ng kh\u00f3 kh\u0103n h\u01a1n.

The \"People Committee\" of her village (UBND x\u00e3 ) had implemented a program to encourage farming. They would exchange farm land for  unexploited one. Ms T\u00e2m and her husband decided to make an exchange for an acre of land for fish farming. She was one of the first to exploit farming. She had some successes and some failures but she did not get discouraged. She was determined to reach her goal. With dedication and determination, she had been able to turn her farming business into a profitable one. Today she owns 1 acre for fish farming, a paddle of 200 egg laying ducks, 150 chicks. She had also invested in pig raising, she has 3 sows and 3  herds of piglets. The production from her family's farm is quite impressive (2 tons of pork, 1 ton of fish, 200 egg laying ducks). On average, her family makes about 450 USD\/ month.

Barang yang dijual pun beraneka macam seperti makanan ringan dan kebutuhan pokok setiap hari bahkan sayur mayur.Setiap hari Ni Ketut Suarni membuka warung pada pukul 07.00 wita dan tutup pada pukul 18.00 wita. Karena warung ada didepan rumahnya, maka jika tidak ada pelanggan yang berbelanja Ni Ketut Suarni bisa melakukan pekerjaan rumah tangga lainnya. Dalam menjalankan usaha ini Ni Ketut Suarni membutuhkan  dana untuk menambah usaha warungnya karena pelanggannya banyak sedangkan modal yang dimiliki sangat terbatas. Disamping melayani konsumen secara individu untuk kepentingan sendiri, Ni Ketut Suarni juga menjadi suplyer bagi para pedagang yang lain yang lebih kecil karena modal yang mereka miliki sangat kecil dan terbatas. Sekarang setelah Ni Ketut Suarni mendapat tambahan modal ia dapat melayani para konsumen lebih banyak lagi dengan keuntungan bersih perhari  mencapai Rp.150.000,- yang dulunya hanya memperoleh keuntungan bersih perhari Rp 50.000. Usaha warung ini ditekuninya dengan harapan  kedepannya usaha warung dapat lebih meningkat dan menjadi lebih besar lagi dari sekarang."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":83611,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To add the

The boda boda is a motor bike, and it gets its name from boda drivers taking passengers to the border and then another boda driver takes them once they cross the border, hence boda boda. So, Isma is a driver for hire. But he also uses his boda boda to transport his goats from the village to town.<p>Isma is very business oriented.

He supports three people and still lives in the home of his wife's parents.  He studied in Bangladesh and has a degree in economics.  He was raised among his family and is the second child.  He had a good childhood since his father was a doctor and made a reasonably good living.  He worked for various companies as an economist, but when his country was invaded and at war he became a refugee in Mozambique in 2000.  When he arrived to Mozambique life was difficult due to the cultural differences and because he had to leave his family behind.  He became friends with others who had come from Asia and through them was able to use the savings brought from his home country to establish as small general store and to marry a young woman from Mozambique.  Among his customers at the store he became friends with a general of the FADM who told him about HLUVUKU.  He decided to apply for a loan to increase the stock of merchandise in his store.  He successfully repaid his first loan.  Now he wants to take out an additional loan to expand his business.  He recently invested in another store and does not have sufficient capital to puchase enough merchandise to stock the store, especially with the increased demand of the holiday season.  Through this business he has gained a lot of good experience and has a vision for the future of his business.  He currently has 8 employees, with an average of 4 children each.  With the earnings from the store he pays his employees' salaries, covers his taxes, reinvests in additional merchandise for the store, and has just enough to cover his daily expenses.  With a loan for 160,000MT he intends to purchase additional basic household goods to stock his stores.  His business has no problem to do this because he owns his own transportation and when he cannot travel to purchase goods for the store he can send one of his employees.  His wife also contributes to the success of their business.  His vision for the future is to expand the business to import\/export products to the north, purchasing beans and peanuts to sell in Maputo and to take basic goods from Maputo to sell in the north.  The business is currently doing well and he is motivated to invest his money to buy a truck for the business.<p><b>\r\n\r\nTranslated by Kiva volunteer Julie Lerch<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nAbdallah Ahmede Razaque, nasceu em bangladesh na cidade de Sylhet a 37 anos aos 09 de Agosto de 1970, sustenta 3 pessoas e reside ainda na casa dos seus sogros, fez o ensino superior onde licenciou se em economia em Bangladesh.\r\nViveu e cresceu num ambiente familiar com os pais e irm\u00e3os, sendo ele o segundo filho.

The business is stable because Samir has been collecting his customers over the time he has been running this shop. Unfortunately, he has no capital to invest to diversify his inventory, increase turnover and thereby the income to provide all the necessities of life. Comercial banks demand collateral to give Samir credit, but Samir has nothing to mortgage. That's why he applied to Normicro's Saatli branch, where we disburse loans without demanding collateral.

At the store they sell things on credit, such as: blenders, cameras, irons, televisions, DVD players, washing machines, cellular phones, and even freezers and refrigerators, in addition to stereos and other things. Raimundo is one of the best sales people in the store.

Raimundo buys 18 karat gold at $13.00\/ gram and sells it at $16.00\/ gram. This is the third loan for Raimundo and he has a good payment history.

Ni Ketut Karni bought 2 mother pigs with a price of Rp600,000 (about US$66)\/piece, so for 2 mother pigs it was Rp1,200,000 (about US$132). The rest Rp700,000 (about US$77) was used to buy feed. Every day Ni Ketut Karni is busy with her animals besides being a mother raising 1 school aged child. According to Ni Ketut Karni raising mother pigs would bring faster results, because the 2 mother pigs will bore piglets and feed expenses would not be too high compared to fattening piglets. Usually every 5 months mother pigs could bore around 5-6 piglets per mother pig. From potential sales from 2 mother pigs could reach Rp2,500,000 (about US$275). Feed expenses only Rp500,000 (about US$55). So nett Ni Ketut Karni could profit Rp 2,000,000 (about US$220). With this profit Ni Ketut Karni likes to buy 1 more mother pig, to increase income and to enhance family life.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Gwan Liong Ang, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nDengan pinjaman modal yang di dapat dari Dinari sebesar Rp.1.900.000,- Ni Ketut Karni memulai usahanya. Ni Ketut Karni membeli 2 induk babi  dengan harga perekor Rp.600.000,- jadi 2 induk babi harganya Rp 1.200.000,-. Sisanya Rp.700,000,- dipergunakan untuk modal pakannya. Setiap hari Ni Ketut Karni  sibuk  mengurus usaha ternaknya disamping sebagai ibu rumah tangga yang mengurusi 1  orang anaknya yang masih sekolah. Menurut Ni Ketut Karni memelihara induk babi lebih cepat menghasilkan, karena nantinya dari 2 ekor induk babi ini akan beranak dan untuk biaya pakannya pun tidak terlalu mahal dibandingkan dengan memelihara babi pengemukan. Setiap 5 bulan induk babi ini akan melahirkan anak yang rata \u2013rata bisa beranak antara 5 sampai 6 ekor per induk dari hasil penjualan anaknya dari 2 induk babi pendapatan kotornya bisa mencapai  Rp 2.500.000,-. Pengeluaran pakan hanya Rp.500.000,-. Jadi bersihnya Ni Ketut Karni bisa  memperoleh keuntungan Rp 2.000.000,-. Dengan keuntungan ini Ni Ketut Karni ingin membeli induk lagi 1 ekor agar bisa menambah hasil dan memperbaiki kehidupan keluarganya."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":83952,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy

Makharram lives in the city of Saatli in Azerbaijan. He is 57, married and has 4 children. Makharram purchases calves, raises them with the help of his wife (see photo) and then sells them when they are grown up on the local market. This business allows him to provide his family with the bare minimum needed to survive in a small village setting. The children, however, are growing and so are their needs. Makharram is thinking about increasing the profit from his business by investing additional funds into it. He has come to the local microcredit organization - Normico, a partner of Kiva, asking to borrow $500 in order to increase the size of his business. With this money Makharram will be able to purchase 5 more calves than he usually purchases on an annual basis.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Jane Mazur, Kiva

Aflatun lives in the viscinity of the city of Saatli in Azerbaitsjan. He is married and has three children. His family is a low income family. His only source of income is a small herd of sheep and calves. Each year in August his wife (see photo) and him purchase lambs and calves with the money that they have been able to save over the year. They raise them on their property and then sell them to butchers on the local market. They use the money they obtain to provide for the family. However, the children are growing and so are their needs. Aflatun is planing to increase his income by increasing the amount of cattle he has in his herd. In order to do this he came to Normico, a Kiva partner, hoping to borrow $500. \r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Jane Mazur, Kiva volunteer<\/b><\/p>

Starting as a hobby in cooking and a having lots of free time. Wife of Putu Widana, up to now still childless started to fill in her free time by making food assortments, like: vegetables, cake and fish. Afterwards Ardani brought her cooking to a foodstalls, or to a travelling sales person in her village. Since Ardani's  income looks promising, this is currently the family's main income. Profit of Rp25,000 (about US$3)\/daily is felt by Ardani not enough for the family, so Ardani works harder. To expand the business,  Ardani borrows the capital from Dinari, that she used to buy a motircycle to support her business, since with a motorcyle, Ardani who earlier brought her production to foodstalls or other salesperson as middlemen, could sell directly to the consumers, by travelling sales in her village, and also other villages. This activity is done 2X\/day, morning from 5:00-8:00 AM, and afternoons from 2:00-6:00PM. Income \/ profit received by Ardani also increases to Rp60,000-80,000 (about US$7-()\/daily.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Gwan Liong Ang, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nBerprofesi sebagai pedagang sayur dan makanan sudah dilakukan Ardani sejak 2 tahun yang lalu.  Berawal dari hoby memasak dan banyaknya waktu luang yang di miliki.   Istri dari Putu Widana, yang sampai saat ini belum di karuniai anak ini memulai mengisi waktu luangnya dengan membuat berbagai jenis masakan seperti: sayur, kue dan ikan . Kemudian oleh Ardani semua masakannya itu di serahkan ke warung \u2013warung ataupun di titip pada pedagang sayur keliling yang ada di desanya. Melihat hasil yang di dapat oleh Ardani sangat menjanjikan , usaha ini dijadikan sebagai sumber pendapatan utama keluarganya saat ini. Keuntungan Rp 25.000, \/ hari yang di dapat oleh Ardani dirasakan kurang mencukupi kebutuhan keluarganya , hingga Ardani harus bekerja lebih keras lagi . Untuk mengembangkan usahanya Ardani meminjam modal dari Dinari , yang di pergunakan untuk membeli sebuah sepeda motor untuk menunjang kelancaran dari usahanya, karena dengan sepeda motor ini Ardani yang dulunya hanya menyerahkan hasil produksinya pada warung atau pedagang lain , kini Ardani  bisa menjual langsung kepada konsumen (pelanggan )dengan berkeliling di  desanya bahkan sampai keluar di desa-desa lain. Kegiatan ini dilakukan Ardani sampai dua kali sehari, yaitu pagi dari jam 5 sampai jam 8, dan sorenya mulai pukul 2  sampai 6 . Hasil \/ keuntungan yang di dapat Ardani pun meningkat yaitu berkisar Rp 60.000,- sampai Rp. 80.000 \/ hari

He was emprisoned at the age of 19, when he tried to join the political group Front for the Liberation of Mozambique (FRELIMO), and released a few years later as the war for independence went on. Alexandre is the father of  7 children and a client of Hluvuku since 2003. This is his 6th loan cycle and he intends to use the requested amount to repair one of the two mini-buses he owns and runs as public transportation. His limited insurance won't cover the repair costs and he needs the vehicle in order to make a living. His transportation business employs two full-time drivers and two part-time helpers. Buses run from 6:00 am to 7:00 pm and consistently bring in a good profit after all expenses are paid. The money he makes from the business goes toward household and school expenses, and to the maintenance of the two vehicles. His activities have a very positive impact on his community, since the mini-buses are the most commonly form of transportation used by it. Alexandre hopes to improve his business in the near future by adding more mini-buses.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Portuguese by Aline Pereira, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nLocaliza\u00e7\u00e3o: Bairro Polana Cani\u00e7o-Maputo\r\nCliente: Alexandre Mateus V.\r\nActividade: Transporte, reabilitacao da viatura\r\nValor de empr\u00e9stimo: 100.000,00 ( 4.000 usd)\r\nAplica\u00e7\u00e3o: , Reabilitacao da viatura\r\nIn\u00edcio: 07-11-07\r\nFim: 30-04-09\r\n\r\n\r\nAlexandre Mateus V., nasceu aos 22 de Junho de 1951 em  Macalauane, Distrito de Chibuto Prov\u00edncia de Gaza, apartir dos 18 anos veio a Maputo onde viveu com sobrinho, qual foi respons\u00e1vel pelo seu estudos.

She's 42 years old and lives with her partner and children. At the age of 6 she went to live with her grandparents, and was able to attend school until 4th grade. She has been with her partner, the father of her children, since she was 17. \r\n\r\nRight after starting a small business selling basic groceries, in 1992, Elisa got ill and was forced to stop working for a year. Once she got better she decided to dedicate herself to the business of selling clothes, which she has been doing for 4 years now. Elisa buys the clothes in downtown Maputo (the children's clothes are the most lucrative ones) and rents a car to have the pieces delivered to her neighborhood, where she sells them at a stand located near home. Elisa doesn't have a bookkeeping system to keep track of her transactions (she doesn't know how to do it and says she prefers to keep it all \"in her memory.\") Business is going very well for her, and she wants to use her loan to increase her inventory. Profits  from the sales are divided between helping with the household expenses, reinvesting in the business and saving. The Hluvuku loans have had a very positive impact on Elisa's life so far, and she hopes it will help her buy a piece of land in her home province, one day.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Portuguese by Aline Pereira, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nLocaliza\u00e7\u00e3o: Bairro ferrovi\u00e1rio \u2013Maputo\r\nCliente:Elisa Armando C.\r\nActividade:Com\u00e9rcio\r\nValor de empr\u00e9stimo: 15,000.00mt ( 600usd)\r\nAplica\u00e7\u00e3o: venda de Roupas\r\nIn\u00edcio: 08\/10\/07\r\nFim: 30\/01\/2009\r\n\r\nElisa Armando C., nasceu aos 25 de fevereiro de 1965 em Namaacha prov\u00edncia de Maputo, tem 42 anos de idade, casada maritalmente tem    filhos estudou at\u00e9 4\u00aaclasse .\r\nViveu com os pais at\u00e9 aos 6 anos e com aus\u00eancia do pai teve que ir viver com os av\u00f4s at\u00e9 aos 16 anos , aos 17 anos junta-se com seu marido.\r\nEm 1992 iniciou o neg\u00f3cio de venda de produtos da 1\u00aa necessidade num dos mercados da cidade, algum tempo depois fica gravemente doente facto que lhe obrigou ater que parar durante um ano.depois de melhorar retoma o neg\u00f3cio tendo mudado o tipo de neg\u00f3cio passando a vender a roupa at\u00e9 ent\u00e3o e faz este neg\u00f3cio a 4 anos.\r\nN\u00e3o tem forma\u00e7\u00e3o neste neg\u00f3cio e n\u00e3o emprega ninguem por enquanto.Com o empr\u00e9stimo de 15,000.00mt comprou fardos de roupa para revenda.\r\nAbre o seu neg\u00f3cio as 8 horas e para chegar no seu posto de trabalho n\u00e3o usa nenhum meio de transporte por este  se localizar perto de casa.

She was brought to Dar es Salaam over 4 years ago by her sister in order to find work, after she and her husband separated. Since then, her sister has passed away.\r\n<p>\r\nHaelen opened her shop in 2003. There, she sells sugar, beans, rice, sodas, ice cubes, and other general food items.  She makes about $18 a week from this business. Rent for her shop costs about $20 a month and she pays her shopkeeper a salary of the same amount. \r\n<p>\r\nRealizing that the shop business was not dependable because of the fluctuating costs of her inventory, Haelen started selling clothes on the street about 6-7 months ago. From this business, she makes a profit of about $35 a week.  Her customers generally pay her by weekly installments. Besides paying for school fees and general expenses, she is using her profits to build a house on land that she recently purchased.\r\n<p>\r\nEarlier this year, Haelen took out a loan which helped her move her shop to a different location. Having paid this back successfully, she hopes to take out another loan to increase her shop\u2019s inventory and to buy more clothes to sell. \r\n<p>\r\nShe belongs to the group \"Giraffe,\" which consists of 27 other members who keep each other accountable and insure one another in paying back their loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":84061,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To increase inventory","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":87,"posted_date":"2007-11-15T15:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Haelen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-11-29T19:32:26Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":1000000,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":250000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":225}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":225,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2007-12-29T10:19:24Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-05T15:21:45Z","rounded_local_amount":253912.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":104679,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":225,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2008-01-29T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-05T15:21:45Z","rounded_local_amount":253912.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":124084,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":225,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2008-02-29T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-05T15:21:45Z","rounded_local_amount":253912.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":145795,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":225,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2008-03-05T15:21:45Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-05T15:21:45Z","rounded_local_amount":253912.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":150226,"comment":"Haelen was able to pay the remaining amount of her loan early.

Because of this Rosa, with a loan from Manuela Ramos, began crafting mats from leftover wooden scraps to help supplement the family\u2019s income.\r\n\r\nShe runs her business from a small shop where she takes scraps of wood and creates the mats.

Eldar lives in the city of Saatli in Azerbaidjan. He is 54, married and has 4 children. Eldar is the only breadwinner for the family. He earns money by raising cattle and selling it on the local market. Each year he buys young calves from nearby farmers and neighboring villages and raises them for 8 to 9 months on his property. When they are all grown up, Eldar sells them to the local butcher shops. Currently Eldar is thinking about increasing the size of his business because current income is insufficient to provide for his four children. He is planing to purchase 2 more calves than usual. In order to be able to do that he requires an additional $500. This is why he came to Normico, a Kiva partner looking for help.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Jane Mazur, Kiva volunteer<\/b><\/p> \r\n\r\n\u0413-\u043d \u0415\u043b\u044c\u0434\u0430\u0440
