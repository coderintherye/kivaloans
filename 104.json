E. is 19 years old, is a native of Bluefields, Nicaragua, and is single.  For a year has been making a living selling perfumes and other beauty products from the Selsa company.  This business functions as follows:  based on orders, a Selsa company representative sends beauty products to young G. on credit and she is responsible to sell these and to pay for the products, for which they pay her a commission of 30% on the sales.  In this way young Norma G. takes home this pay to help with the expenses of the house of her mother, who is a single parent.  Nonetheless her main problem is that her clients who are mainly women, buy these products on payment terms (in two and three twice-monthly or monthly payments), thus although G. is selling a lot of products, her commission is small. It should be mentioned that young G. only sells these products since the orders that she makes out are for products ordered in advance and she only needs to deliver them once they are sent to her.  It is for this that she needs a loan in order to buy these products which will permit her to make a profit of 60% on each item. She wants to buy:  4 bottles of Ferratt perfume at $10 each, 4 bottles of Mistery perfume at $50 each, 4 bottles of Esse perfume at $15 each, 4 bottles of papaya shampoo at $10 each, 6 containers of hair gel at $13 each, 4 dandruff shampoo at $11 each, 6 ladies\u2019 deodorants at $4 each, and 3 acne lotions at $13 each.\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by Diane Lister, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nLa joven Norma G. E. tiene 19 a\u00f1os de edad, es originaria de Bluefields, es soltera y desde un hace un a\u00f1o se dedica a venderle perfumes y otros productos de belleza a la empresa Selsa. Este negocio funciona de la siguientes manera, una representante de la empresa Selsa le envia en base a solicitud productos de belleza a la joven G. al credito y esta se encarga de venderlo y cobrar el producto por lo cual le pagan una comision del 30 % sobre las ventas. De esta manera la joven Norma G. lleva este pago a su casa para ayudar en los gastos de la casa a su mama que es madre soltera. Sin embargo su problema  principale es que sus clientes que son mas  del genero femenino le compran estos productos con facilidades de pago (en dos y tres cuotas de pago quincenal y mensual), por lo que aun que vende bastantes productos, su comision es poca. Cabe mencionar que la joven G. vende estos productos ya que los pedidos que realiza son por encargos y solamente tiene que entregarlos una vez que se los envian. Es por esto que requiere de un financiamiento para poder comprar estos productos de los cuales les permite obtener una ganancia hasta del 60% por cada uno. Quiere comprar: 4 perfumes Ferratt a US$ 10 dolares cada uno, 4 perfumes Mistery a US$ 50 dolares cada uno, 4 perfumes Esse a US$ 15 dolares cada uno, 4 shampoo papaya a US$ 10 dolares cada uno, 6 gel

She and her husband together with their children live a simple life. Gusti Ayu works as a manufacturing worker in a furniture factory, however her salary is not enough to meet her family's daily needs. Therefore around 6 months ago she decided to take for a loan from Dinari so she can afford to buy a breeding pig and to start a small pig breeding business as her side business. <p>\r\nWith the loan money she bought 2 breeding female pigs which in turn can produce 18 piglets. These piglets were sold for IDR 250 thousand\/ piglet (around USD 31\/ piglet) so her revenue was  IDR 4.5 million (around USD 562). This revenue was deducted with money spent for pig feed for a 6 month period of IDR 1.4 million (around USD 175), so she earned a net profit of USD 387 in a 6 month period. <p>\r\nTherefore she is now decided to again applying for the 2nd loan from Dinari so she can continue expanding her business.

Melalui program DINARI, pada periode pinjaman pertama digunakan untuk membeli 2 ekor induk babi. Dari 2 ekor induk babi tersebut melahirkan 18 ekor anak babi dan bisa dijual dengan harga Rp. 250.000 \/ ekor. Dari 18 ekor anak babi tersebut diperoleh hasil penjualan sebesar Rp. 4.500.000.- \/ 6 bulan, yang dipotong untuk pakan induk sebesar Rp. 1.400.000.- \/ enam bulan.

Thi Mai had started planning with her husband, Thanh Van Nguyen, to join the Tinh Thuong Fund which focuses entirely on agricultural ventures.  From then on the couple decided to  borrow money to invest in raising livestock.  In every funding round the couple had used the money to invest in livestock.  With this focus, the family\u2019s finances have improved markedly and they have been able to afford more conveniences.  Mrs. Mai\u2019s son earns an average of 2,500,000 VND per month from his work, and this amount is used to make the weekly payment to the Fund.  Extra income is put towards larger and more important uses.  In this round of funding the family is requesting 13,000,000 VND to invest in raising pigs.  The family\u2019s average income is 4,000,000 per month.  \r\n<p><b>Translated from Vietnamese by Chi Nguyen, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nNgay t\u1eeb nh\u01b0ng ng\u00e0y \u0111\u1ea7u Qu\u1ef9 tri\u1ec3n khai tr\u00ean \u0111\u1ecba b\u00e0n th\u00f4n nh\u00e0, ch\u1ecb Mai Th\u1ecb Ki\u1ec1m \u0111\u00e3 b\u00e0n b\u1ea1c c\u00f9ng ch\u1ed3ng l\u00e0 anh Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Thanh, tham gia v\u00e0o Qu\u1ef9 T\u00ecnh Th\u01b0\u01a1ng, v\u1edbi m\u1ed9t \u0111\u1ecba ph\u01b0\u01a1ng thu\u1ea7n n\u00f4ng ngu\u1ed3n thu nh\u1eadp ch\u00ednh ho\u00e0n to\u00e0n ph\u1ee5 thu\u1ed9c v\u00e0o n\u00f4ng nghi\u1ec7p.

Thi Nguyen, though only 26 years old, is praised by the local people for her very keen business sense.  She joined the Fund in 2002.  She and her husband boldly borrowed from the Fund to raise pigs; after many rounds of funding and the livestock business going well they have been able to save a decent amount of money.  With this money and supplemental loans from family they have been able to buy an automobile with the goal of offering freight service to people in need. Because of these bold business ventures the family\u2019s finances are relatively good compared to local standards.  Both of their children are school-aged and they are very obedient and are doing well in school.  In this round of funding, the couple is asking for 9,000,000 VND to continue investing in raising livestock.

deciding to settle in the city of Juliaca with her family, Lidia has fought to make progress and provide peace and education to her three beloved children. This exemplary mother and her husband, Aurelio, have, little by little, established a small workshop, where they transform metal into beautiful doors and windows for orders. At present, they live in the home of her in-laws, where they were able to set aside a space to establish their workshop, but seeing the discomfort and the little space that they have, they long for the day that they have their own premises. With this goal in mind, this diligent family works with determination. In addition to this work, Lidia wants to enter the handicrafts trade. She is sure that knitting and selling her beautiful pieces of clothing will significantly help with her household expenses.  \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by A.
