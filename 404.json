It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Most of the group members have moved from their village to the city to be able to feed their families.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by David Gibbons, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":543787,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"To provide business working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"Mbour","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.5 -17","type":"point"}},"partner_id":108,"posted_date":"2010-05-22T11:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":975,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aissatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ndiaya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ndeye","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maty","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Diarietou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2011-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2011-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2011-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":97.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-17T08:36:28Z","rounded_local_amount":50866.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151971398,"comment":null},{"amount":97.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-23T09:37:40Z","rounded_local_amount":50866.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159708686,"comment":null},{"amount":97.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-08-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T11:40:59Z","rounded_local_amount":50866.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166922717,"comment":null},{"amount":97.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:49:07Z","rounded_local_amount":50866.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172189232,"comment":null},{"amount":97.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-10-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-18T13:02:49Z","rounded_local_amount":50866.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177484651,"comment":null},{"amount":97.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-11-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-17T11:57:51Z","rounded_local_amount":50866.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182620895,"comment":null},{"amount":97.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-12-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-11T14:35:16Z","rounded_local_amount":50866.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188758468,"comment":null},{"amount":97.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2011-01-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-01T11:45:06Z","rounded_local_amount":50866.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191495371,"comment":null},{"amount":97.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2011-02-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-25T09:26:21Z","rounded_local_amount":50866.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195923343,"comment":null},{"amount":97.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2011-03-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T12:19:16Z","rounded_local_amount":50866.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201365764,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-05-22T15:17:45Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T12:19:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":202566,"name":"Gilberto","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gilberto C. was born in Maputo city, the capital of Mozambique, in 1971 and has never lived anywhere else.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

This will minimize the time spent in looking for animal feed and provide a constant supply.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Paul would like to supply more milk and have pure breeds in the next five years.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":543800,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To construct a store for animal feed","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Litein","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2010-05-22T11:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Paul","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":50000,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-13T08:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":4166.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":55.25,"local_amount":4250,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:59:09Z","rounded_local_amount":4400.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151920640,"comment":null},{"amount":55.25,"local_amount":4250,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:29:58Z","rounded_local_amount":4400.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159661010,"comment":null},{"amount":110.5,"local_amount":8500,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:19:15Z","rounded_local_amount":8801.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172142265,"comment":null},{"amount":55.25,"local_amount":4250,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:57:00Z","rounded_local_amount":4400.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177437096,"comment":null},{"amount":65,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:47:31Z","rounded_local_amount":5177.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188712235,"comment":null},{"amount":45.5,"local_amount":3500,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:19:19Z","rounded_local_amount":3624.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191450034,"comment":null},{"amount":110.5,"local_amount":8500,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:57:44Z","rounded_local_amount":8801.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195872104,"comment":null},{"amount":44.42,"local_amount":3416.7,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-21T08:10:19Z","rounded_local_amount":3537.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":202029964,"comment":null},{"amount":54.16,"local_amount":4166.67,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-19T07:54:45Z","rounded_local_amount":4314.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206668060,"comment":null},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":4166.63,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-16T08:12:15Z","rounded_local_amount":4314.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211446607,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-05-22T16:04:05Z","paid_date":"2011-06-16T08:12:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":202578,"name":"Andr\u00e9","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Andre Tome S. was born in the Mozambican Sofala province.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Pour sa famille, elle compte faire grandir ses enfants et le voir terminer tous les \u00e9tudes dans les meilleures conditions.\nMadame Kavugho B. remercie l\u2019IMF Hekima pour  les cr\u00e9dits permanents qu\u2019elle re\u00e7oit sans aucune garantie mat\u00e9rielle car gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 ces cr\u00e9dits, elle parvient \u00e0  se prendre en charge et subvenir aux enfants. \nCe groupe Faida est  compos\u00e9 de 22 membres femmes.                 \n\n\n\n","en":"Kavugho B. is the president of the borrowing group Faida. She is standing on the far left and raising her hand in the photo. She is 42, married and the mother of seven children who are presently attending school. Her husband is the doorman at the residence of a Baptist church pastor at the Africa Center (CBCA). \r\n\r\nKavugho B. sells used clothing at the central market of Virunga. To increase her income, Mrs. Kavugho B.  also makes tablecloths and sells cooking sets. She has been selling used clothing for 8 years. She began her business with her own funds, which she had received from her brother-in-law, and also with money earned selling small items for her neighbor. Her initial working capital amounted to US$ 10. \r\n\r\nWith the MFI Hekima loan, she is intending to buy one bale of used shirts and 1\/2 bale of used pants. Her greatest challenge is that sometimes in a bale of used clothing, she finds items that are completely worn out and sometimes torn. In a bale of used clothing, there are sometimes useless items that no one will buy. This constitutes a loss for her. \r\n\r\nMrs. Kavugho B. hopes to manage to get a container of bales of used clothing and become a wholesaler in her town. This would be possible with a loan of US$ 5000 which she hopes to obtain one of these days. As for her family, she intends to raise her children so as to see them finish their studies under the best possible conditions. \r\n\r\nMrs. Kavugho B. thanks Hekima for the continued loans that she receives without any collateral, for it is due to these loans that she is able to support herself and her children. \r\n\r\nThis Faida group consists of 22 members. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated

leap in the dark.

Her calling card in all this uncertainty was her sense of self-esteem. She believed she could give a good account of herself in this business.\r\n\r\nScovia worked incessantly hard to overcome all the problems that had manifested themselves at her business's inception. Before all this, she was into another business \u2013 selling charcoal. With persuasion from a friend, she decided to venture into something different. One and a half years later, after being prevailed upon, she took root in her bar and restaurant business.\r\n\r\nScovia\u2019s down-to-earth line of conduct has won her laurels amongst her clientele. Her current financial status exemplifies how rapidly her business is growing by leaps and bounds and she earns profits amounting to 90,000 shillings a week. She also runs another business to eke out a living \u2013 a piggery.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Scovia wants to purchase more drinks for her bar and also more food for her

is a 37-year-old mother of two who lives with her family in San Rafael, San Jose, located in the central valley of Costa Rica. She has been a client of Fundacion Mujer over the past twelve years, utilizing loans to finance her various entrepreneurial activities.\r\n\r\nThe loan consultant who has been working with Nancy over the years describes her as an organized, dedicated, hardworking and independent entrepreneur with a fighting spirit. In the past, Nancy has experienced difficulties making repayments on time. The loan consultant says that now, with Nancy\u2019s mother helping to take care of her children, Nancy will have more time to dedicate to her business and struggle less to make repayments.\r\n\r\nNancy has a business selling various products including jewelry, clothing and perfumes to members of her community. This loan will be used specifically to finance the purchase of perfumes and colognes which she plans to sell at a 50% profit margin. Her most expensive perfumes sell for 100,000 colones (approximately 180 USD).\r\n\r\nNancy spends all day Saturday dedicated to her business, making sales and collecting payments. Throughout the week, clients pass by Nancy\u2019s house to make purchases; if she isn\u2019t around, her mother will make the sale. Nancy acts as a supplier to her husband, who sells products to his customers (he drives a taxi as well), and to her cousin who sells products at her high school.\r\n\r\nFor her perfume-selling activity, Nancy\u00b4s sister has put her in touch with a supplier in Alajuela, the neighbouring province to San Jose, where Nancy hopes to secure a good price for some perfumes in order to increase her income. She says her most popular products are her least expensive perfumes.\r\n\r\nAlthough she has only a high school education, Nancy has proven herself as an adept businesswoman. Her goal is to open a type of bazaar in her house where customers could peruse the various product she has to offer.\r\n\r\nNancy says her main obstacle is working capital but she also sometimes has trouble collecting payments from new clients. To address this issue, She tends to keep a closer eye on newer clients, allowing them longer pay periods and the purchase of more expensive products on credit only as the clients prove they are trustworthy.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, business is good. Nancy is making a good amount of sales and her client base is growing.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":532782,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Perfumes","sector":"Retail","use":"To

He specializes in auto painting. His typical activities include auto body work, painting and cosmetic repairs. This is an occupation that he had chosen because he felt attracted to it. Mr. F. is 52 years old; he lives in a suburb of Dalifort and has been a mutual fund member for six years already. He is seeking a credit of 100,000 West African Francs in order to purchase supplies needed for his work, such as paint, polish etc. He is happy that the popularity of his shop in the community has been steadily growing  And thus in an average month, the number of cars he has to paint can reach 10 and more, and he can earn 100,000 West African Francs per month. In this way, he earns an income allowing him to take care of his own needs and to provide for his family. He already repaid a previous loan; the new loan would help him keep his commitments to the customers, enhance his work and strengthen his business.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ekaterina Sukhanova, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":543886,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Auto Repair","sector":"Services","use":"Bolstering business capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"DAKAR","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.695112 -17.443886","type":"point"}},"partner_id":108,"posted_date":"2010-05-23T17:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ousmane","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":100000,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2011-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2011-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2011-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":20,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2010-06-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:25:06Z","rounded_local_amount":10434.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151971401,"comment":null},{"amount":20,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:15:53Z","rounded_local_amount":10434.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159708690,"comment":null},{"amount":20,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T11:40:33Z","rounded_local_amount":10434.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166922721,"comment":null},{"amount":20,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-04T14:22:47Z","rounded_local_amount":10434.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172189236,"comment":null},{"amount":20,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:36:14Z","rounded_local_amount":10434.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177484655,"comment":null},{"amount":20,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:48:11Z","rounded_local_amount":10434.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182620899,"comment":null},{"amount":20,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2010-12-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:54:17Z","rounded_local_amount":10434.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188758472,"comment":null},{"amount":20,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2011-01-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T05:54:59Z","rounded_local_amount":10434.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191495375,"comment":null},{"amount":20,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2011-02-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:25:36Z","rounded_local_amount":10434.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195923346,"comment":null},{"amount":20,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2011-03-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T12:18:49Z","rounded_local_amount":10434.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201365767,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-05-23T22:02:25Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T12:18:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":202638,"name":"Bernadette A.","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"D.

Married to Jean Sossou, Marie-Louise is the mother of five children, all of whom have attended school. Just two children are still in the care of Marie-Louise and her husband. Almost thirty years ago Marie-Louise settled in the Ay\u00e9lawadj\u00e8 district of Cotonou, where she still lives with her family. She and her husband share the household expenses. Marie-Louise received very little schooling. To meet her expenses, she sells ice, hibiscus juice, yoghurt and ice pops out of a shop in her home. At the same time, she sells \u201cbouillie,\u201d a type of porridge made from corn starch, and telephone calling cards. Marie-Louise gets her supplies from Dantokpa, Benin\u2019s international market. She has been running this business for 15 years and has already obtained five loans from ALID\u00e9. Marie-Louise repaid all her loans in full. Marie-Louise has had some financial difficulties in the past and wishes to boost her business to better satisfy customer demand, This is why Marie-Louise is requesting a sixth loan.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Sarah Llewellyn, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":543902,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"To buy corn to make bouillie, and sugar, hibiscus, etc. to make fruit juice","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Cotonou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.35 2.433333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2010-05-23T00:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lydia Marie-Louise ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":150000,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2011-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":30,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:40:38Z","rounded_local_amount":15651.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144653485,"comment":null},{"amount":30,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:08:46Z","rounded_local_amount":15651.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151835697,"comment":null},{"amount":30,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:10:07Z","rounded_local_amount":15651.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159576094,"comment":null},{"amount":30,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-30T08:14:35Z","rounded_local_amount":15651.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166954608,"comment":null},{"amount":30,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-28T09:52:04Z","rounded_local_amount":15651.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172056265,"comment":null},{"amount":16,"local_amount":8000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-03T10:26:17Z","rounded_local_amount":8347.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177347800,"comment":null},{"amount":4,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-05T09:07:03Z","rounded_local_amount":2086.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188617652,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:09:16Z","rounded_local_amount":52170.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191361053,"comment":null},{"amount":30,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-28T09:13:22Z","rounded_local_amount":15651.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195779754,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-05-23T06:03:27Z","paid_date":"2011-03-28T09:13:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":202650,"name":"V\u00edctor Alejandro","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"V\u00edctor Alejandro F.

He is a hard working and responsible husband and father who lives in his own home with his wife, Justa, 52, and their 3 minor children to whom he wants to offer a better quality of life.  With his wife's support, Alejandro decided, 35 years ago, to buy some plots of land in which to work and thus improve his family's finances.  At present, he is still working the land, but it is much more productive now than before. Over time, he learned how to have greater production from his fields. What he likes the most about his job is the close relationship he has with the earth, and he also enjoys watching his plantings grow. He has been doing this for 40 years and he considers the hardest thing to be taking care of his fields in inclement weather, since any oversight can affect the crop. Looking ahead, he hopes that the price of vegetables goes up, since his working capital will be affected if the opposite happens.  This is the fiftth loan Alejandro has had with MFP. He is very happy to have obtained it, since he needed it urgently for his business. He is a well liked member of his communal bank, since he always brings order to the meetings. With the two thousand nuevos soles he has asked for, he will purchase more fertilizer for his plantings and he will also invest in purchasing cattle.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ellen Donohue, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":543917,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"He will purchase fertilizer and some heads of cattle.

He has been doing this type of work for 16 years and thinks that the most difficult part of the job is to have to work the land for the entire day.  This does not leave him with much time for other activities.  In the future, he would like to have lands dedicated to sowing fields of peas, which are the best sellers these days.  \r\n\r\nThis is the fifth loan for Alejandro through partner organization MFP.

He lives in a house he owns with his wife, Rina, 25, and his much-loved daughter, Abigail, 3.  Rina and Abigail are the reasons that Ronald works so hard to get ahead.  He operates a business cultivating potatoes, maize, peas and broad beans.  Every day, starting very early, he works in his fields because he knows that the money that he will get for his crop depends very much on its quality.  He sells his crop in the city market because that is where he can get the most for it.  What he most likes about his job is harvesting his fields because that is when he feels that his hard work has paid off.  Ronald has worked at farming for 15 years and says that the hardest thing about it is spraying the crop with pesticides because the chemicals can damage the plants.

Her family helps her to carry out the daily responsibilities of running the pizzeria. The majority of her regular clients work in the surrounding area. These include banana field labourers and telecommunications sector employees. Katty plans to open a second pizzeria in Jimenez; for this reason she needs to buy another oven.

Giorgino is 12 years old, and Dayana is 7 years old.  They all live in their own house.\r\n\r\nZoila has been selling tamales (typical food in the city, the base is ground corn) for over three years.  Previously she made these dishes in her home, and sold them as a street vendor in her neighborhood.  Other times she makes them to fill an order.  Thanks to her good seasoning, her food is requested a lot.  \r\n\r\nSaturdays and Sundays are the days that Zoila has the most customers.  That is why she likes her work so much.

Nevertheless, preparing the tamales takes time and great precision to achieve the flavor that her diners like so much.\r\n\r\nIn the future she wishes to expand her business and increase her production.

She still needs to buy zinc sheet metal, nails, sand, and cement in order to make this upgrade, which will be very satisfying to her.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Hugo Reyes, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":544144,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"Building materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:25Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Flor De Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":8000,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2011-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2011-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2011-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":42.43,"local_amount":848.52,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:03:37Z","rounded_local_amount":900.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159562146,"comment":null},{"amount":40.16,"local_amount":803.13,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:18:15Z","rounded_local_amount":852.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166771053,"comment":null},{"amount":39.09,"local_amount":781.83,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T07:46:15Z","rounded_local_amount":830.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172204945,"comment":null},{"amount":41.05,"local_amount":820.93,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T12:03:27Z","rounded_local_amount":871.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177330639,"comment":null},{"amount":40.49,"local_amount":809.73,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T11:42:43Z","rounded_local_amount":859.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182465791,"comment":null},{"amount":39.62,"local_amount":792.46,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-19T09:10:37Z","rounded_local_amount":841.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189097930,"comment":null},{"amount":39.32,"local_amount":786.45,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T00:47:01Z","rounded_local_amount":835.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191348526,"comment":null},{"amount":40.38,"local_amount":807.61,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:05:42Z","rounded_local_amount":857.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195766200,"comment":null},{"amount":40.08,"local_amount":801.67,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T09:57:43Z","rounded_local_amount":851.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201209269,"comment":null},{"amount":37.38,"local_amount":747.67,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T09:58:46Z","rounded_local_amount":793.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206078118,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-06-04T18:30:28Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T09:58:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":202768,"name":"Jaqueline","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jaquelin, es una madre de familia muy trabajadora, vive con su esposo y sus 3 hijos en casa de su madre.

Years ago she began to sell school supplies, but did not have much success, so she turned to another business: the sale of used clothes. However, her greatest inclination was to sell stuffed animals, since very few people sell this product. She now makes a good income, successfully selling them to customers who buy them as gifts.\r\nHer husband did not initially have much faith in her work, but now that he sees how happy she is, he supports her purchases. She has been in this business for 5 years, and the most difficult aspect has been gaining a space in the market, as it has been informal up until now. This is her twelfth loan with MFP and she knows it will be very useful. It will increase her working capital. She promises that she will repay the instalments on time. She intends to invest this loan in the purchase of more stuffed animals, and on the other hand she wants to help her husband buy a tire for his motorcycle.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Christine Cooper, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":544142,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Stocking up on stuffed animals","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:25Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jaqueline ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":221.95},{"due_date":"2010-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":234.23},{"due_date":"2010-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":243.18},{"due_date":"2010-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":254.48},{"due_date":"2010-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":267.17},{"due_date":"2010-11-06T07:00:00Z","amount":278.99}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.68},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.98},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.12},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.06},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.51},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":77.68,"local_amount":221.95,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:03:22Z","rounded_local_amount":223.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151934568,"comment":null},{"amount":81.98,"local_amount":234.23,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:37:03Z","rounded_local_amount":235.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159673341,"comment":null},{"amount":85.12,"local_amount":243.18,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:27Z","rounded_local_amount":244.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166887165,"comment":null},{"amount":89.06,"local_amount":254.48,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:13Z","rounded_local_amount":255.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172154176,"comment":null},{"amount":93.51,"local_amount":267.17,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:13:41Z","rounded_local_amount":268.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449486,"comment":null},{"amount":97.65,"local_amount":278.99,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:00:12Z","rounded_local_amount":280.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588157,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-06-15T02:44:11Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T15:00:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":202769,"name":"Ana Gabriela","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ana Gabriela is a 29-year-old mother of two who lives with her husband, children and a friend in her mother-in-law's house in Las Vegas del Tortuguero, located in Lim\u00f3n near the Caribbean coast of Costa Rica.

Ana organizes her work day so that in the morning she tends to the animals, and in the afternoon she completes her household duties.

C. is from the village of Thailand, Banisilan, South Cotabato. She is 41 years old, married and has four school-aged children. To make a living, Emily owns and operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling both food and daily use products in the local community. Emily has been engaged in her business for over four years and earns approximately 15,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Emily joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan from HSPFI which was used to purchase additional inventory and working capital. Emily is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be the sixth loan she has taken out from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

C. is from the village of Eastern Wao, Lanao del Sur. She is 29 years old, married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Annie owns and operates a specialized retail business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling scrap metal, empty bottles and other used products in the local community. Annie has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Annie joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She is requesting a loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be the first loan she has taken out from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Its main economic activities are cattle and agriculture, specifically the farming of grains, tubers, and oranges.\r\n\r\nSince she was a child, Petrona has gotten up at 4 am every day to milk her family's cows.  Dairy farming has always been a part of her life. In her village, there is plenty of demand for the milk she produces, and she has always been able to feed her family.  Nevertheless, she would like to buy more cows to increase her production and thereby make more use of skills.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, Petrona has asked for 662,000 colones ($1,200) to buy three more cows so that she can expand her business and offer her children a better life.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Petrona  is a member of Empresa de Cr\u00e9dito Comunal Unidos por un Desarrollo, one of 100 organizations affiliated with EDESA in Costa Rica. This will be her first loan.  She is thankful for this type of microfinance and credit organizations for giving her access to the financial services that will allow her to dedicate more time to her business.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ross Forman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":544221,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase three cows","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Alajuela","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":127,"posted_date":"2010-05-24T21:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Petrona","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":662000,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":220666.66},{"due_date":"2012-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":220666.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":220666.67}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":400}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":400,"local_amount":220666.66,"processed_date":"2011-06-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:52:22Z","rounded_local_amount":220835.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216487551,"comment":null},{"amount":0,"local_amount":0.34,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-18T08:54:27Z","rounded_local_amount":0.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257701122,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-05-25T05:04:42Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":202823,"name":"Juvelyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Juvelyn H. is from the village of Eastern Wao, Lanao del Sur.

V. is from the village of Kilikili, Wao, Lanao del Sur. She is 42 years old. Virginia is married and has 4 school-aged children. To make a living, Virginia owns and operates a furniture-making business.  The main source of income for the business comes from making and selling cabinets and wardrobes to local businesses and community members. Virginia has been engaged in her business for more than 4 years and earns approximately 16,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Virginia joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Virginia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from HSPFI. That loan was used to to purchase tools and other equipment to expand the business. Virginia is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP to be used to purchase raw materials to make additional furniture. This loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by Virginia from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Cynthia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 12,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used as working capital and to purchase additional inventory. Cynthia is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP, to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the 5th loan taken out by Cynthia from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Orly has been engaged in her business for more than 3 years and earns approximately 9,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Orly joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Orly has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used as working capital, and to purchase additional inventory. Orly is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by Orly from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

U. is from the village of San Roque, Mahinog, Camiguin Province. She is 47 years old. Elisa is married and has 5 adult children. To make a living, Elisa owns & operates a business selling tamarind candies, potato chips and peanuts in the local community. Elisa has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Elisa joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and the ability to engage in business activities. Elisa has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase raw products and ingredients. Elisa is requesting a new loan of 11,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be the 3rd loan taken out by Elisa from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the income of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

To make a living, Luzviminda owns & operates a business baking and selling bread such as ensaymada, sputnik bread and cakes in the local community. Luzviminda has been engaged in her business for over 4 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Luzviminda joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and the ability to engage in business activities. Luzviminda has successfully repaid a previous loan of 16,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase the raw ingredients needed to make the products she has for sale. Luzviminda is requesting a new loan of 16,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be the 6th loan taken out by Luzviminda from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Marina is requesting a new loan of 7,000 Php which will be used to purchase more dried squid to sell. This is the second loan taken out by Marina from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \n\nAbout HSPFI:\n\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Arlene has been engaged in her business for less than one year and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Arlene joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Arlene has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Arlene is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory and working capital. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Arlene from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

Even though she is financially unable to consistently combat poverty and the challenge to supporting her family, Sampaguita has never seen a life happier than hers since her family supports one another through thick and thin. \r\n\r\nHer husband works hard in the field farming rice as a hired laborer. His small and sporadic income is remitted to Sampaguita, being the one in charge of the family budget. A large portion of it goes for the education of her two children in high school.  \r\n\r\nSampaguita really wants her children to graduate from college and have a better career in the future. She was frustrated when her eldest child stopped schooling after elementary. However, she had no choice then because she didn\u2019t have enough income to support her education. With that, Sampaguita learned a lesson. She realized she has to have her own business and supplement the income of her husband. \r\n\r\nThis realization led her to ASHI in 2002. Since then she has been receiving loans and has able to put up her own small \u201csari-sari\u201d (variety) store, selling a small volume of various grocery items, foodstuffs, beverages and other commodities. People would tend to buy things they need from her than going to market and spending carfare. Therefore, Samapguita\u2019s store has acquired a lot of customers from around their village. \r\n\r\nProceeds from this business have somehow made life easy and enjoyable for her family, especially her children. Because she sees the potential of improving their standard of living once her business has grown, as well as its profit, Sampaguita is applying for a much larger  loan amount from ASHI. Her husband supports her decision for this because he sees his wife enjoying her career running her own business.

During her almost five years in ASHI, she has shown herself to be industrious and determined to make her dreams come true. Her family is very thankful that she has an opportunity to improve their standard of living through the proceeds of her variety store business that she has established with the support of the loans she has requested from ASHI.The variety store business has brought happiness to Evelyn\u2019s family, and especially to her. Because of its profits, she has been able to send her children to school. Being a good mother, Evelyn\u2019s dreams are always for her children and family. She always wanted to support her children to have a brighter tomorrow and a decent life.\r\n\r\nWith that in mind, Evelyn is requesting a loan from ASHI amounting to 30,000 Php to purchase more supplies for her store in order to attract more customers. Specifically, the amount will be used to pay for inventory of groceries for her store. She is very determined and disciplined to use the money which is lent to her. This would not only provide her with happiness in life, but would also make her business grow and make more profit, which will allow her to support the educational needs of her four children until they graduate from college.\r\n\r\nEvelyn is hopeful that her business will grow into a full-fledged mini-grocery store and that someday she will have branches in nearby villages. One of her aspirations is to be able to build a house that is durable and spacious.\r\n\r\nHer long-term goals are to purchase a new 'jeepney' (public transport vehicle) and tricycle (three-wheeled motorcycle) so she can expand her business to other surrounding neighborhoods.   By owning her own transportation, Evelyn will save time and money in purchasing a greater variety of inventory.  With her hard work, Evelyn is hopeful that her business ventures will continue to grow and improve the overall quality of living for her family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":544663,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

being poor and having limited access to a lot of opportunities to improve herself and life, having been married and becoming  a mother to her two-year-old only child at an early age, Ronnah felt happy and blessed when she became a member of ASHI in 2008. Aside from being able to receive a loan and finance her own business, she is happy about the opportunity of meeting other women and mothers in their village and listening to their sharing of experiences in growing a business and how they balance their own career being a wife and mother at the same time as a business woman. Aside from her family, members of ASHI in the center she belongs to are her inspiration to become a better and more productive woman.\r\n\r\nRonnah wants to support the education of her only child until she graduates from college. Therefore she has started growing her small \u201csari-sari\u201d store now while Jorin Mikaela, her daughter, is still young. \u201cSari-sari\u201d means a small volume of various grocery items, foodstuffs, beverages and other commodities. People tend to buy things they need from here than going to market and spending carfare. Profit gained from this business is Ronnah\u2019s means of supporting the needs of her family. She also wants to start up a hog fattening and hog-raising business in their backyard through the loan she requests, so that her father whom she supports will have his own means to earn an income.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to her small \u201csari-sari\u201d store turning into a big grocery store which sells complete commodities through loans she can access through ASHI, Ronnah hopes to build up a savings fund to finance her dream of building their own house and living independently from her

She has been managing a small variety store for quite some time now.\r\n\r\nBrenda Lee has been a regular member of Center for Community Transformation (CCT) for almost six years. She regularly attends its weekly fellowship meetings* and pays her weekly dues consistently. Her good repayment performance with her previous loans means she was able to borrow thirteen times from CCT\u2019s cooperative. She is consistent in paying her dues because she used the money she borrowed to expand and improve her business.\r\n\r\nTo ensure the success of her business, Brenda Lee would like to apply for a loan of 24,000 PHP.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling daily use products such as canned goods, some snack food, eggs, shampoo, soap and toothpaste. She also sells electronic loads in the local community. Jovelita has been engaged in her business for over four years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Jovelita joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from GDMPC which was used to purchase additional products to sell. Jovelita is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will also be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the fifth loan she has taken out from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's general living conditions. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.
