This is 30-year-old Josephina N. from Mbeya. She is married and has three children between the ages of 1 and 13. She is also responsible for supporting one dependent whose parents cannot care for her. \n\nJosephina has been running a genge business since 1999. \"Genge\" is the Swahili word a type of outside shop or stall. A genge is usually a very basic structure made of wood with a tin roof where the proprietor sells general items such as onions, tomatoes, chilli, oil, rice, and dried fish. It is the kind of place where local people send their children running to fetch something when they are in the middle of cooking the evening meal and don\u2019t have time to go all the way to the market to buy the missing ingredient.\n\nJosephina works at her business for 12 hours per day, 7 days per week, and is assisted by two employees. Josephina currently earns about $51 USD each month from her business. She is requesting a loan of $800 USD to purchase more sugar, kerosene, soap and cooking oil in bulk. In the future, she plans to increase the quantity of goods in order to get more profit from her business .

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":288038,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase more sugar, kerosene, soap and cooking oil in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-03-16T03:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Josephine B.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

This is 40-year old Rebecca K. from Mbeya. She is single with two children, between the ages of 10 and 14. She is also responsible for supporting one dependant because he is an orphan. Rebecca has been running a local restaurant known as \u201cmama lishe\u201d since 1998. When you see a SELFINA entrepreneur whose business title is \u2018restaurant\u2019 or \u2018caf\u00e9\u2019, you may have to adjust your mental image of what that is. A local restaurant or caf\u00e9 in Tanzania usually consists of a rough wooden table and some long, wooden benches, with the sky as a ceiling. Such places don\u2019t even appear in the Lonely Planet\u2019s budget guide, but if you\u2019re looking for a cheap and tasty meal, and someone to have a chat with, this is the place to be. The food is all local: rice, ugali (a hot sticky dough, made from maize flour), plantain (a cooked savory banana), all served with beans, vegetables, meat, and a variety of yummy sauces.\n\nShe works at the business for 9-12 hours per day, 6 days per week. Four employees assist her. Rebecca currently earns about $250 USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of $550 USD in order to make improvements to her restaurant and quality.

Ruth has been running a local restaurant known as \u201cmama lishe\u201d since 2008. When you see a SELFINA entrepreneur whose business title is \u2018restaurant\u2019 or \u2018caf\u00e9\u2019, you may have to adjust your mental image of what that is. A local restaurant or caf\u00e9 in Tanzania usually consists of a rough wooden table and some long, wooden benches, with the sky as a ceiling. Such places don\u2019t even appear in the Lonely Planet\u2019s budget guide, but if you\u2019re looking for a cheap and tasty meal, and someone to have a chat with, this is the place to be. The food is all local: rice, ugali (a hot sticky dough, made from maize flour), plantain (a cooked savory banana), all served with beans, vegetables, meat, and a variety of yummy sauces.\r\nShe works at the business for 9-12 hours per day, 6 days per week and one employee assists her. Ruth currently earns about $120 USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of $400 USD in order to buy rice, beans, flour, cooking oil, and sugar in bulk for her business. In the future, she plans to to open the same business at a new location. Ruth thanks you for your support!\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":288125,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"To buy rice, beans, flour, cooking oil, and sugar in bulk ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-03-16T21:10:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ruth M.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:27:18Z","rounded_local_amount":85933.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027639,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-05-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:15:42Z","rounded_local_amount":85933.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613640,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:03:57Z","rounded_local_amount":85933.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010719,"comment":null},{"amount":66.68,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:40:28Z","rounded_local_amount":85933.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63233005,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-08-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:55:16Z","rounded_local_amount":85933.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664796,"comment":null},{"amount":66.65,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:49:10Z","rounded_local_amount":85933.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105508,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-03-16T21:30:12Z","paid_date":"2009-10-16T02:49:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":95172,"name":"Ahmad","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ahmad is a 35-year-old man who lives in Saida, Southern Lebanon with his wife and their child.

When you see a SELFINA entrepreneur whose business title is \u2018restaurant\u2019 or \u2018caf\u00e9\u2019, you may have to adjust your mental image of what that is. A local restaurant or caf\u00e9 in Tanzania usually consists of a rough wooden table and some long, wooden benches, with the sky as a ceiling. Such places don\u2019t even appear in the Lonely Planet\u2019s budget guide, but if you\u2019re looking for a cheap and tasty meal, and someone to have a chat with, this is the place to be. The food is all-local; rice, ugali (a hot sticky dough, made from maize flour), plantain (a cooked savoury banana), all served with beans, vegetables, meat, and a variety of yummy sauces.<P>\r\n\r\nTina works at the business for 12 hours per day, 6 days per week, and is assisted by one employee.

Her business purchases crops from farmers and sells them in town for a higher price. She works at the business 12 hours per day, 6 days per week. Rebeka currently earns about 65USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of 325USD in order to purchase bags of rice and beans in bulk.

Rebeka thanks you for your support!\r\n<p>\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":288209,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":288215,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To

She  liked Microinvest's terms so she decided to obtain a new loan in order to increase her sales business's working capital.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Anna Brown, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2675,"image":{"id":288221,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To expand the business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Isfara","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.116667 70.633333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":"2009-03-19T02:10:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Saboat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":10000,"loan_amount":2675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":865.63},{"due_date":"2009-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":893.04},{"due_date":"2009-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":921.32},{"due_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":950.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":980.6},{"due_date":"2009-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1011.65},{"due_date":"2009-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1043.69},{"due_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1076.74},{"due_date":"2009-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1110.83},{"due_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1146}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":231.56},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":238.89},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":246.45},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":254.26},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.31},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":270.62},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":279.19},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":288.03},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":297.15},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":306.54}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":231.55,"local_amount":865.63,"processed_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T22:06:30Z","rounded_local_amount":869.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36015997,"comment":null},{"amount":238.89,"local_amount":893.04,"processed_date":"2009-05-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:13:49Z","rounded_local_amount":896.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44599725,"comment":null},{"amount":246.45,"local_amount":921.32,"processed_date":"2009-06-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:58:04Z","rounded_local_amount":924.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52994167,"comment":null},{"amount":254.27,"local_amount":950.5,"processed_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-06T11:01:51Z","rounded_local_amount":954.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63215447,"comment":null},{"amount":262.31,"local_amount":980.6,"processed_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-10T10:26:36Z","rounded_local_amount":984.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73644941,"comment":null},{"amount":270.62,"local_amount":1011.65,"processed_date":"2009-09-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-14T09:16:29Z","rounded_local_amount":1015.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87084490,"comment":null},{"amount":279.19,"local_amount":1043.69,"processed_date":"2009-10-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-04T09:30:12Z","rounded_local_amount":1047.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97000762,"comment":null},{"amount":288.03,"local_amount":1076.74,"processed_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-25T09:22:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1081.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103846172,"comment":null},{"amount":297.15,"local_amount":1110.83,"processed_date":"2009-12-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-10T08:42:21Z","rounded_local_amount":1115.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110737292,"comment":null},{"amount":306.54,"local_amount":1146,"processed_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-06T08:21:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1150.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118127024,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-03-19T12:43:58Z","paid_date":"2010-04-06T08:21:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":95190,"name":"Lilian J.","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mambo (Greetings!) from Tanzania! This is 30 year old Lilia M. from Mbeya. She is married with 2 children, between the ages of 1 month and 2 years old. Lilian has been running Agricultural Inputs since 2006. Her business purchases agricultural equipment in wholesale bases and sells them to farmers in retail bases.\r\n<p>\r\nShe works at the business 12 hours per day, 6 days per week and is assisted by her husband. Lilian currently earns about 188USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of 800USD in order to purchase more agricultural equipment in bulk for reselling. In the future, she plans to open the same business at another location. Lilian thanks you for your support!\r\n<p>\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":288225,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase more agricultural equipment in bulk for reselling","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-03-16T21:10:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lilian J.

Currently, she raises pigs and grows rice and vegetables at her home.  Outside the time she spends on her animals and farming, she works part-time as a waitress in a local restaurant in order to earn some extra income for her family.  With an income of 2,500,000 VND (144 USD) per month, the standard of living of her family is now steadily improving.  In the next round of lending, she hopes to borrow 10,000,000 VND (575 USD) to buy more pigs and animal feed.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by Robert Sides, Kiva

Before she joined the Fund, the financial situation of her family was very difficult because their income depended solely on raising animals and farming.  When she joined the Fund, she used this source of capital to expand her activities raising animals and to buy equipment for brewing wine.  Now, these are the main sources of income for her family, providing them with income of 2,000,000 VND (117 USD) per month.  Besides helping H\u1ea3i with the animals, her husband Minh works as a motorbike taxi driver to earn an extra 1,000,000 VND (58 USD) per month for the family.  In the next round of lending, she hopes to borrow 15,000,000 VND (875 USD) to buy more pigs to raise.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by Robert Sides, Kiva

Sharofat is 40 years old. She\u2019s married with four children. The difficult circumstances and hardships in her life made her recognize the value of work from a very young age. For about 11 years she has been purchasing young sheep and calves in the local market, fattening them and then selling them. \r\n<p>\r\nSharofat is a very hard-working woman, and her diligence is incredible. She works with a strength worthy of immense admiration. She has always looked for a way to provide extra income to her household. Sharofat wakes up early every morning to feed her cows and bulls, with the goal of fattening them and selling them at the best price in the local market. \r\n<p>\r\nThanks to this activity she is supporting her children with education. Sharofat wants to keep educating them because she hopes that they\u2019ll reach the goals that they have laid out for themselves. \r\n<p>\r\nWith this purpose in mind, she is requesting a loan of $750 to buy calves in order to expand her business. Let\u2019s support this brave woman who has a lot of courage and strength to live.    \r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes being a key post along the Silk Road and being the location of the end of the rule of Alexander the Great. It is also known for its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi, and many others. The country, filled with epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and boasts a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nMore about IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Before she joined the TYM Fund, the financial situation of her family was very difficult because their income depended solely on raising animals and farming.  When she joined the Fund, it provided her with capital to invest in a business selling scrap materials.  Currently, raising animals and her scrap materials business are the main sources of income for her family, for a total of 4,000,000 VND (230 USD) per month.  In the next round of lending, she hopes to borrow 10,000,000 VND (575 USD) to invest in buying up scrap materials for her business. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by Robert Sides, Kiva

is a 43-year-old woman who lives in Bourj el Barajneh, southern suburbs of Lebanon, with her husband and their four children. Hiyam has owned a bakery since 2003. She has a saj oven in which she does mankoucheh or markouk. The saj is the metal oven where you make the saj bread, a traditional Lebanese cooking dome used to make Markouk (thinned) bread, doughy confections or mankoucheh. A mankoucheh looks like a folded pizza and its most common toppings are zaatar (thyme), jebneh (cheese) and lahm bi ajin (minced meat). You can eat it any time of the day, but somehow it tastes better in the morning.\r\n<p>\r\n Hiyam requested a loan of $1,000 from Al Majmoua in order to purchase raw materials for her work and change the d\u00e9cor of her bakery. This is the first time that Hiyam has requested a loan.\r\n<p>\r\nHiyam is special in her work because she does it well and she is also the only one who does it in her neighborhood. Her clients are her friends and neighbors. When she first started her business, she was lucky to not have any difficulties. Hiyam decided on doing her business because her mankoucheh is good and plus, she always wanted to open a bakery. In the future, she plans on improving her business.

is a 35-year-old divorced woman who lives in Bourj el Barajneh with her daughter. Houda has been doing tattoos since 2002, and has been doing eyebrows for a year. Houda requested a loan of $1000 from Al Majmoua in order to purchase tools for her tattoos. This is her fourth loan cycle and she has always paid on time. \r\n\r\nHer previous loans helped her purchase what she needed for her work, and with them she was able to meet her family\u2019s needs.

is a 45-year-old man who lives in Bourj el Barajneh, in the southern suburbs of Lebanon with his wife and their six children. Hassan has owned a grocery store since 1979. He is requesting a loan of $1000 from Al Majmoua in order to purchase merchandise for his store.

Sedangkan yang kedua, perempuan bernama Ni Luh Kadek Febrianti, baru kelas 2 SD.\nPekerjaan suami Ni Made Suderti yang hanya seorang petani, belum mencukupi kebutuhan rumah tangganya. Padahal Dia juga masih harus membiayai kedua anaknya yang masih bersekolah. Di jaman seperti sekarang ini, biaya sekolah tidaklah murah. Untuk itu Ni Made Suderti memilih memelihara 1 ekor induk babi dan 2 ekor penggemukan. Namun Ni Made Suderti tidak mempunyai cukup dana untuk membeli pakan ternak untuk babinya tersebut. Karena dalam 6 bulan, Ni Made Suderti bisa menghabiskan biaya \u00b1 Rp. 500.000,- untuk 1 ekor babi.\nNi Made Suderti mengajukan pinjaman modal ke Dinari, dengan program 6 bulan dan dibayar di akhir periode. Dengan pinjaman ini, Ni Made Suderti berencana menggunakannya untuk membeli pakan untuk ternak babinya. Ni Made Suderti berharap setelah mendapat pinjaman modal ini, usahanya memelihara babi dapat berkembang. Sehingga Dia dapat membantu suaminya memenuhi biaya sekolah anaknya, serta kehidupan rumah tangganya dapat pula meningkat.\n","en":"Ni Made Suderti lives in a simple house in Katulampa village in manistutu region.

from Tanzania! This is 35-year-old Sarah F. M. from Dar es Salaam. She is married with two children, 8 and 17. Sarah has been running a charcoal business since 2007. She sells charcoal, which are small, black pieces of dry earth that are used by many Tanzanians as a fuel to cook their daily meals. Women cook food in small coal pots, in which they arrange mkaa (charcoal), and add paper, dry grass, old plastic bags or kerosene in order to light them. <P>\r\n\r\nBecause there is such a high demand for charcoal across the country, being a charcoal seller is quite lucrative!\r\nSarah works at the business for 12 hours per day, seven days per week and is assisted by one employee. Sarah currently earns about US$ 150 from her business. She is requesting a loan in order to purchase additional stock of charcoal. In the future, she plans to expand her business. Sarah thanks you for your support!<P>\r\n\t\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. <>\r\n\r\nCustoms and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. <P>\r\n\r\nOne of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

She has been a member of TYM Fund (Kiva Partner in Vietnam) since 2006.  Before joining TYM Fund, her family's main source of income comes from raising animals and farming.  After joining TYM, Mrs. P. was confident to use her loan to open her tailor shop at home to meet the needs of the villagers and increase her family income.  Her business is very good, bringing her family a stable monthly income of 2,000,000 VND (equivalent to 122 USD).  This time Mrs. P. would like to borrow 9,000,000 VND (equivalent to 550USD) to buy more materials to make clothes.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by P.

What you are now is the result of your actions.\u201d \r\n\r\nThis is the philosophy of Everlyn R. of Sta.Lucia, Bagabag, Nueva Vizcaya. She lives happily with her beloved husband Edwin R. and their two children, Charmaine and Charmon R.. The eldest is now in her second year of high school, while the youngest is a grade III pupil.\r\n\r\nEverlyn manages a small 'sari-sari' store at home, meaning 'a small community store' in Filipino. Her husband is a jeepney driver. Both businesses are their major source of family income. At the store, Everlyn only earns an average of PHP750 weekly, while her husband's income from driving a jeep is fluctuating. At times, they are cash-strapped when their children require financial assistance for school. Thus, the couple want to improve their business in order to increase their income and satisfy their needs. \r\n\r\nEverlyn joined a lending institution to support their business and get some benefits offered by the microfinance institution. She is applying for a loan of 7,000 pesos to increase her store capital.\r\n\r\nWith financial support and hardwork, she hopes to make their business grow.

Thi Hoa, 53 years old, has 3 chilren, one of which is still going to school. In 2003, she joined the TYM Fund and started borrowing to invest in raising livestock. Currently, besides livestock, her family also has a small general store. Her husband, mr. Trong, always helps her in raising livestock so that she has more time to take care of the store. With the monthly income of 2,000,000VND, her family has been able to improve their standard of living. This time, she would like to borrow 15,000,000VND to purchase more goods to supply to the villagers. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by Yen Thanh Pham, Kiva

Her husband, Mr. Bey Sopheap, is a farmer who owns a small piece of land where he cultivates both rice and vegetables. However, he now faces an obstacle because his field is infertile and this has damaged his crop. In order to deal with this problem, Mrs. Mom M. decided to ask for a loan to buy fertilizer, and she will use the rest of money to purchase gasoline to use to water the field and make her crop more productive. She is 42 years old and the mother of three children who are attending the local school. Mrs. L.

She is 51 years old, and is married with 12 children between 5 and 33 years of age -- 8 sons and 4 daughters Her 7 oldest children are working, and the other 5 are in school.\r\n\r\nAna's father died after she was born, so her mother married a second time and had to leave her in her older brother's care. But he abused her and she only managed to get through what was called first grade in the old system. When she was 10 years old, she ran away with her friend to Maputo to look for work. She worked as a domestic servant there for five years, and then left Maputo for Namaacha, a village on the border with Swaziland, when she met her husband, who worked for Petromoc in Namaacha. He gave her funds for her to start raising chickens. She's been raising them for more than 10 years. She has between 200 and 300 chickens. She spends 20,000 mt, and earns 7000 mt a month. She manages to save 2000 mt and rents a hencoop for 1000 mt, so that in the future her two children will be able to take care of her nephew, whose parents are dead.\r\n\r\nThis is the first loan Ana will receive from Hluvuku and Kiva. These 15,000 mt will be used to buy and raise chickens, and she is certain she will repay the loan early because besides the chickens she also has her husband's help. Her goal is to build her own hencoop and become a large poultry producer.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Andrea Rosenberg, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":236066,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase chicks to raise poultry","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Namaacha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-25.970278 32.025556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana Valente Mazive ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":15000,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":751.43},{"due_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":773.05},{"due_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":795.29},{"due_date":"2009-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":818.17},{"due_date":"2009-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":841.7},{"due_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":865.92},{"due_date":"2009-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":890.83},{"due_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":916.45},{"due_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":942.82},{"due_date":"2009-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":969.94},{"due_date":"2010-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":997.84},{"due_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1026.55},{"due_date":"2010-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1056.08},{"due_date":"2010-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1086.46},{"due_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1117.71},{"due_date":"2010-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1149.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.8},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.63},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.49},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.36},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.27},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.19},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.15},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.13},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.14},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.18},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.25},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.35},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.48},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.65},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.85},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":95344,"name":"Peme","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Peme O. is a rice grower.

Thiem V. is a villager in Tonle village in Takeo province. She is a chicken breeder. Her husband, Mr. Hang Chha, is a farmer who owns a plot of land where he cultivates rice to earn a living.

Tuichiboy is a very courageous man who manages tough jobs like raising sheep and agriculture. He's the father of four adult children and has the responsibility of supporting his family and providing them with everything that they need. In spite of his difficult economic situation, and after much time, he has been able to get ahead in his business through the purchase of sheep to breed them on his property. His greatest goal now is to improve his economic situation and provide a better way of life for his family. It's for this reason that Tuichiboy is requesting a loan from IMON International to purchase sheep so that he can breed them.  \r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<strong>More about Tajikistan<\/strong>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<p>\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. Although the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\n<strong>History of IMON International<\/strong>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Charles resides in Porto-Novo, the administrative and political capital of B\u00e9nin.  He is the father of two children who are both in school.  Charles is an electronics technician and has made this trade his principal work.  It brings in the revenues that help him to earn his living.  Since electronics is a field requiring significant means, he lacks enough funds for buying the equipment enabling him to make his workshop competitive, so as to do well in satisfying the large number of customers he has.  He also lacks the funds for earning enough to meet his various responsibilities.

He works the fields with the support of his wife, who is also dedicated to the production. This couple has been perfecting and modernizing their production processes. The maintenance of the land has a high cost, due to the attention that must be given to the plants in each phase of the process, such as manually weeding and using organic fertilizer and natural supplements for the control of diseases. These give better yields to their crops, since they prevent the soil from deteriorating so much, provide better conditions for cultivation at planting time and improve the quality of the crop, increasing its value. Organic products currently obtain better prices in the market. Dilovar requests a loan for the purchase of supplies for his crops, such as seeds, fertilizer, fuels and lubricants. He will use part of the loan to pay wages to the hired workers. The loan will greatly improve Dilovar\u2019s income and his family's living conditions.  \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road, the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Ikromidin is 37 years old. He lives with his wife and has two children. Like his parents, who cultivated large crops, he has been a farmer since he was a boy. He enjoys being a farmer. Like his brother, he plants crops and then eventually he or his wife takes the products directly to market to sell. This way, he does not have to give away any of his efforts to middlemen.\r\n<p>\r\nFarming brings Ikromidin good earnings. He tells us that to succeed, you only need to know how to take care of what you plant and to pay attention to what the crops need. Therefore, he fertilizes his crops so that he has a good harvest. \r\n<p>\r\nThis is his fourth loan with IMON International and he is responsible with his payments. The money he is requesting will be invested in high-quality seeds and fertilizer. Ikromidin is very grateful to everyone who is helping him to achieve his goals with this loan.  \r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes being a key post along the Silk Road and being the location of the end of the rule of Alexander the Great. It is also known for its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi, and many others. The country, filled with epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and boasts a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nMore about IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This work is satisfying, and it enables him to purchase goods for his home. \r\n<p>\r\nFathullo would like to request a loan of 6000 Somoni, which he can use to buy necessary farm inputs like seeds and fertilizers that are very expensive.

It is also known for its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi, and many others. The country, filled with epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and boasts a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nMore about IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It is also known for its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi, and many others. The country, filled with epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and boasts a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nMore about IMON International\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History:<p>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"deleted","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":288732,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"purchase stock of vitenge in bulk.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":1500000,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":136363.64},{"due_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":136363.64},{"due_date":"2009-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":136363.64},{"due_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":136363.64},{"due_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":136363.64},{"due_date":"2009-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":136363.64},{"due_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":136363.64},{"due_date":"2009-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":136363.64},{"due_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":136363.64},{"due_date":"2010-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":136363.64},{"due_date":"2010-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":136363.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.82},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.82},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.81},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.82},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.82},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.82},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.82},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.82},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.81},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.82},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.82}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":95394,"name":"Davlyatniso","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Davlyatniso S. is a 47-year-old widowed mother of four children.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed noncreditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed noncreditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":288753,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy stock for

They named their group Me to You. They are local entrepreneurs in Makeni City. They have had several loans from Kiva through SMT. Previous loans have been a great help to the members of this group. Those loans enabled them to expand their businesses, make more profit, and consequently improve the living conditions of the members of the group. Having repaid their last loan successfully, they have requested a loan for Le 500,000 each. \n\nGbasseh B. (right) is the leader of the group. She is 28 and was born in Makeni, in northern Sierra Leone. She is married and her husband is a businessman. They have four children: two are in primary schools, one is in nursery school and the last is still very young. Gbasseh sells palm oil (the most popular cooking oil), rice and \u201cgara lapper\u201d (locally dyed clothes). She also sometimes assists her business by selling second-hand clothes. Gbasseh has been a businesswoman for more than 15 years now.\n\nWith this new loan, Gbasseh will expand her business. She will use the loan to buy two barters (five gallons make a barter) of palm oil, three bags of rice and any other local produce she finds that would be profitable. She will also invest some into her gara lapper (dyed clothing) business. Gbasseh buys her goods from a village called Faradugu.

Her business is to buy the cows and butcher them. She works at the business for five hours per day, seven days per week and is assisted by two employees and her husband.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":288756,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher Shop","sector":"Food","use":"To buy a

Technical Institute Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"These gentle men are staff members of the Government Technical Institute Magburaka, Tonkolili District, Northern Sierra Leone. Government Technical Institute, Magburaka, was founded in 1962 by the government for the promotion of technical and vocational education. They teach mechanical engineering, carpentry and joinery, block laying and concreting, automobile engineering, plumbing and sheet metal work, painting and decoration and many more. Presently, the institute has a total of fourteen staff and twenty-five students. \n\nThe ten years old civil war tremendously disrupted the smooth running of the institute. Before the war, the institute used to have an enrollment of about 200 \u2013 300 students. In 1997 \u2013 2002, rebels vandalized the whole institute \u2013 buildings were unroofed, labs and libraries destroyed. However Sababu Education, a World Bank sponsored project is currently rehabilating the institute. But the project does not call for reequipping the laboratories and libraries.\n\nGovernment Technical Institute Magburaka is the only government technical institute in Magburaka town. Over the years, the institute has been able to train so many technicians serving both within and without Sierra Leone. It makes good grades at the external examinations organized by City and Guilds of London Institute. The institute also serves as a consultancy and guard to the people of Magburaka. \n\nThis is the first loan Government Technical Institute is requesting from Kiva through SMT. With this loan, some of these teachers will start a small business and those who are already running small businesses will invest the loan into their businesses. Some of the staff members will be using the loan to buy pieces of furniture, others to pay either for their children in their education or pay for themselves to pursue further studies. Others will use their loan in home building projects.  \n\nDavid E.A. K. is the principal at the Institute. He has been a teacher for forty-three years now.  Mr. K.

from Tanzania! This is 36-year-old Fatuma H J. from Dar es Salaam. She is married with two children. Additionally, Fatuma has been running a charcoal business since 2002. She sells charcoal, which is a small, black piece of dry earth used by many Tanzanians as a fuel to cook their daily meals. Women cook food in small coal pots, in which they arrange mkaa (charcoal), and add paper, dry grass, old plastic bags or kerosene in order to light them. Because there is such a high demand for charcoal across the country, being a charcoal seller is quite lucrative!<p>\r\n\r\nShe works at the business for 13 hours per day, six days per week. Fatuma currently earns about $100 USD from her business. She is requesting a loan in order to buy charcoal stock.  In the future, she plans to increase her stock. Fatuma thanks you for her support!\r\n\t\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus, they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":288774,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Charcoal Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

She considers herself a spirited woman, reliable and responsible with her repayments. \r\n<p>\r\nAmadith is very grateful to Manuela Ramos for allowing her to grow not only as an entrepreneur but also as a woman.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Carolyn McCaffrey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":288862,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Spare Parts","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchase spare auto parts such as headlights and exhaust pipes for a variety of vehicles.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"San Mart\u00edn - San Mart\u00edn","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2009-03-23T16:30:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Amadith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":416.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":133.33,"local_amount":416.67,"processed_date":"2009-03-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:16:07Z","rounded_local_amount":423.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27111833,"comment":null},{"amount":133.33,"local_amount":416.67,"processed_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:18:39Z","rounded_local_amount":423.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36007026,"comment":null},{"amount":133.33,"local_amount":416.67,"processed_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:43:35Z","rounded_local_amount":423.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44590700,"comment":null},{"amount":133.44,"local_amount":416.99,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:27:45Z","rounded_local_amount":424.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52984962,"comment":null},{"amount":133.22,"local_amount":416.35,"processed_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:14:54Z","rounded_local_amount":423.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63205325,"comment":null},{"amount":133.35,"local_amount":416.65,"processed_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T18:47:43Z","rounded_local_amount":423.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73634600,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-03-23T19:30:19Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T18:47:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":95466,"name":"Dorcas","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dorcas I. is 43 years old and married with 5 children.

It is also here where she has had a shop for 8 months, as she noticed that this business would be a great opportunity as her house is located in a central and busy zone.  Since then she has started to see the fruit of her labours.  Her kids and her are in charge of attending to the clients that come in to buy the foods that she sells, and out of preference she serves them in the morning and dedicates herself to domestic chores in the afternoons.  Helvia is very satisfied with this business as well as constantly growing personally as she is independent and has now decided to keep moving forward with her business until she becomes a vendor of foodstuffs by bulk.  It is her first loan with MFP and she was invited to join the communal bank of which she is now a member of because they saw in her a strong, responsible and committed woman.  For her part Helvia assumes the committment of playing a postive role in the development of the group.  The money she has asked for is to invest in buying sacks of vegetable stew, rice and sugar, which are the most in-demand products in her store, and each sack of 50 kilos costs on average 70 soles.

Previously, she worked for someone else, but her childhood experience of watching her parents with their own business has encouraged her to start a restaurant business of her own, which is growing rapidly. \r\n\r\nEvery day, she cooks and tends to the restaurant, serving up to 40 meals per day.  The only day she rests is on Wednesday, because the sales are lower on that day.

For the past three years Olimpia has run the risk of losing her merchandise during the trip because during the rainy season there are landslides on the highway that prevent travel and food products spoil.  As this happens in the first few months of the year, she has decided to sell locally during those times.  In the future, Olimpia wants to have a grocery store, but in the meantime will continue to work as before.  This is the first time she has had a loan with MFP.  She is happy to be a member of the community bank and has promised to be an active participant in the group's development.

She lives with her husband and 3 children in their own house.  She has had a store for one year.  Her decision to start this business was driven by the need to generate income to help support the household.  Every morning she opens her store to sell her merchandise, basic needs items.  Sales are down during the school year because her neighbors have more expenses buying school supplies for their children.  She has less merchandise during these months, but she keeps reserves to stock her store.  Waiting on her customers is enjoyable and one of the things Sonia most enjoys.

San Cristobal is a mountainous area where people make their living from such activities as business; cultivation of vegetables, coffee, and other crops; handicrafts; cattle, and many other activities.  Jose Mauricio is single and lives with his mom, his sister, and his nephew.  He owns a farm where he grows vegetables and has dairy cows for the production of milk.\r\nDairy farming is a business that he learned from his family; his parents have developed the business over many years.  At the present time, Jose Mauricio milks six cows, which takes up half of his time.  He wishes to purchase a milking machine which would save him a great deal of time and allow him to improve other aspects of the dairy operation.  Jose Mauricio sells milk and cheese to his neighbors in the community, and they have been very satisfied with being able to buy fresh products made in an atmosphere of trust by someone they know.\r\nJose Mauricio has been a member of the group Empresa de Credito Comunal San Crist\u00f3bal Norte (SACRIN) for eight years.  This is one of the 100 member organizations of EDESA in Costa Rica.  During that time he has received 15 microloans in order to run his farm.  He has paid off each one responsibly.  At this time he is requesting a loan of $1,200 to buy the milking machine over 24 months to be paid in fixed installments each month.

Brigada is a full time employee of the Sobolma company.  She works as an assistant paper cutter.  Additionally,  with her daughter's help she sells all kinds of sweets and candies .  She sells them outside of a kindergarten that is taught on the premises of the local Red Cross.

Uzma baji completed her education until 10th standard, but she couldn\u2019t study further because her parents married her off to A. A. who is a tailor with 5 years of experience. Uzma khanum baji is the mother of three kids: two sons and one daughter. All of her kids are enrolled in a school which is near their home. Uzma baji is also involved in a sewing clothes business. She sews clothes by taking orders from her neighbors and relatives. She charges $2 per dress. She uses her income to pay off the school fees for her kids, because her husband bears the household expenses. She successfully repaid her first loan from Asasah (a microfinance institute of Pakistan). Now she is applying again for a loan to buy an electric sewing machine for her husband so that he is able to sew more clothes. \r\n\r\nUzma baji is the group leader of three other women from her locality.

All the members of the group know one another because they live in the same neighborhood. Carolina and Justina share a blood relationship; they are cousins but work with incomes totally independent of each other. The members carry out different commercial activities; the majority of them work with already established businesses like grocery stores, clothing sales, food, cosmetics, and other activities like mechanic service and metal refinery. Each one makes a daily income. With regard to the competition, they are aware of it and this is why they need financing to fight it. The loan is planned to be used to boost store stocks, buy work material, and purchase tools to improve fulfillment of services. The majority of the members worked in the first loan cycle and demonstrated honesty and responsibility with their payments.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jay Osborne, Kiva

For more than 26 years he has lived with the mother of his 4 children.  One child still lives at home with them.  His business is agriculture.  He inherited some small farms from his father.  Passion fruit grows on the farms.  Cultivating them does not require much investment or fertilizer.  He only uses organic manure.   After every perennial harvest he sells the produce, but it is not very profitable for him.  He therefore grows medicinal plants and other herbs for teas.  This way he can pay for his children's studies. He also has another business.  He buys and sells gasoline and petroleum products.  He takes advantage of the location of his house, which is located on the central road.  His customers drive heavy duty trucks, which increases his income.  Luis is happy to combine agriculture and the petroleum business because it allows him to increase his earnings, which go toward his home and educating his children.  He has been very active with MFP; this is his 5th loan.  He has always made all of his payments responsibly.  He is very conscientious with his community bank, and is pleased with the savings he deposits every month.

Before joining the TYM Fund, her family's economic situation was very difficult as her husband had died and she had two small children. The main source of income was from farming and livestock raising. To date, after 10 years of participation in the Fund, she proactively borrowed money to expand the farming and livestock raising business and learn to be a tailor. Currently, apart from raising livestock, she and her daughter make gloves and clothes for garment workshops. The family's income is at VND4,500,000 per month.\r\n<p>\r\nIn this loan cycle, she wishes to borrow VND15,000,000 to buy sewing machine and textiles to make clothes.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from
