She lives in the Saqa district in Chiclayo province- a tourist area where most of the people are in farming or cattle raising.\r\n\r\nCarmen raises poultry such as hens and ducks in pens behind her house.  She feeds the birds a balanced diet and once they have grown to an optimal size, she sells them to the people in the district who in turn sell them to people from outside her area.\r\n\r\nShe will use the loan to buy more birds and food for them, and thus take care of her expenses and needs.    She decided to request a loan from Edpyme Alternativa of 1000 new sols with the goal of helping her son get ahead and to have a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nCarmen is a mother who wants to improve her life by being responsible and hard-working in everthing she does and in this way improve her son's life."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":302.35,"image":{"id":763098,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy poultry and animal feed","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Saqa -

She has been living there with her family in a single room brick house for the past 16 years. She is 44 years old and married to R. A., who repairs cooking ranges. He is very good at his work and provides first class repair services to his clients at a very reasonable cost.\r\n\r\nAzra has given birth to two sons and two daughters. Her sons are young and at school while her daughters have a hosiery business. Azra also works. In order to support her husband financially, she weaves carpets. The income she earns helps her pay the school fees for her children. She is also a very good housewife and fulfills her household work very well.\r\n\r\nAzra has applied for a loan from Kiva's partner, Asasah, for the improvement of her husband\u2019s business. With the loan, he will buy tools to provide better quality repair services to his clients and earn more profits.

She is a very supportive lady who tries her best to provide relief to her family with her work. She has applied for a loan from Kiva partner Asasah to improve her husband\u2019s business.

He works in the home tile business. He has seven years of experience in this field. He is trying to develop his business and improve his financial situation and social status, as well as the financial situation and social status of his family, as he has a very good relationship with his family and provides them with all of their material needs. He stands out in his field due to his experience and skill; however, what is hindering his progress in his business is a lack of capital. He needs capital in order to progress in his business and develop himself financially and socially. He has customers from his community and his neighborhood. With a loan from al-Majmoua, he would like to buy a truck (model \"Rapid\") to use in his work, as well as new equipment to expand his business.

Beatriz y su pareja son el sost\u00e9n de sus hijos, ella desde muy ni\u00f1a trabaj\u00f3 en las tierras de sus padres y hoy es toda una conocedora de la labor que realiza en el campo, es campesina y cuenta con 05 hect\u00e1reas de terreno cultivado con caf\u00e9, barbasco y pl\u00e1tano, plantas nativas de la zona selv\u00e1tica.

She is 37 years old and she is a very hardworking woman. She lives in a house that she owns together with her husband, Romulo, 39 years old, and their 7 beloved children, to whom she wants to provide a better future. Beatriz and her partner are the support for their children. Since she was a very young girl she worked the land with her parents and today she is an expert in agriculture. She is a farmer and she has 5 hectares of land where she cultivates coffee, barbasco (an inedible shrub that is used to stun fish), and bananas. These are native plants to the jungle region. She has been working in this business for 10 years and during the harvest she has her children's support and that of farm hands to quickly collect the products. What she most enjoys about her work is the harvest. This is when she feels that the months of arduous work are rewarded with the quality of the product. The most difficult part of her work is having to transport the products from the fields to the collection centers in the city of San Francisco. She also struggles with an insufficient income to cover the advance payments to the farm hands that help with the harvest. This is why she requests a loan through MFP (Kiva Field Partner). But her priority now is to plant more coffee plants. She has 2 hectares of land that are ready to cultivate. This is her 13th loan with MFP and she says that the funds from this loan will help her a great deal in the progress of her business. She is very well liked by the other members of the communal bank. With the 2000 nuevos soles that she requests she will hire farm hands to provide her with the help that she needs with the harvest and to combat against plagues."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":763484,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to hire farm hands to help her with the harvest and to combat against plagues.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-05-04T13:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Beatriz ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-04-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":725,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:18:13Z","rounded_local_amount":2056.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245163,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-05-04T21:24:17Z","paid_date":"2012-02-15T11:18:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":295766,"name":"Nasrin","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nasrin lives in the Negev.

She is married to Juan, 46, and their union has yielded 3 children.  They live in their own home in the Canal community, part of the Samugari district.  Ercelia\u2019s work involves tending to land where she grows cacao, coffee and citrus.  She does her work at the side her husband, who also works hard to generate income for the family.\r\n\r\nShe has found it convenient to take her products to the city of San Francisco where, as she tells us, she can get better prices for her goods.  When her workload increases, she has no problem finding migrant laborers to help her out.  What she enjoys most about her work is protecting the crops against plagues that threaten productivity.\r\n\r\nShe has been in farming for 20 years, and finds the most difficult aspect to be transporting her products.  The trip from her farm to her community is long and tiring, but this is where the drying of her respective products takes place.

Maribel y su pareja son el pilar de sus hijos, desde muy ni\u00f1a sus padres le inculcaron a remover la tierra, es por ello que aprendi\u00f3 a labrar la tierra. Hoy cuenta con 05 hect\u00e1reas de terreno cultivado con plantas de barbasco, cacao y caf\u00e9. En tiempos de cosecha cuenta con el apoyo de los peones quienes se encargan de cosechar y trasladar los frutos hasta los tendales.

Su dificultad radica en no poder contar con suficiente ingreso econ\u00f3mico para solventar los pagos por adelantado a los jornaleros quienes le brindan el apoyo con la extracci\u00f3n de sus frutos y sacar la maleza de sus campos; es por ello que acude a los pr\u00e9stamos que facilita la instituci\u00f3n MFP.

She lives in her own house with her partner, Candelario, 32, and their beloved children: Percy, 7, and Maricarla, 4, for whom she wants to provide a better wellbeing. Maribel and her partner are their children\u2019s pillars.  \r\n\r\nSince she was a young girl her parents taught her to work the land and she learned how to till the soil.  Today, she has 5 hectares of cultivated fields growing coffee, barbasco (an evergreen bush) and cocoa beans.  During harvest time she hires laborers to bring in the crops and transport the fruit to the drying spots.  What she likes best about her work is wandering among the green areas breathing in the pure air that nature provides.  She considers the most difficult part of the job having to transport her products from her community to the gathering centers located in the city of San Francisco which is where the best prices are to be had.  Her difficulty rests in not being able to find sufficient funds to pay her workers in advance for bringing in the crop and clearing out the weeds from her fields.  This is why she calls on the loans that MFP makes available. However, her main priority now is to plant more coffee plants because she has fields available to do so.  \r\n\r\nThis is her second loan with MFP.  She knows that if she repays it on time she will be able to access another loan more easily.  She will use the requested 1500 new soles to hire field hands to help her with the coffee harvest and to clear weeds from her fields.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":763569,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":" to hire field hands to harvest coffee and clear out the weeds.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-05-04T22:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maribel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-04-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":550,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:18:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1560.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245171,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-05-05T03:15:05Z","paid_date":"2012-02-15T11:18:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":295816,"name":"Nueva Esperanza Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Los socios pertenecen al banco comunal \u201cNUEVA ESPERANZA\u201d; Este banco se ubicada en el distrito D.

Por ahora espera sembrar m\u00e1s plantas de cacao ya que cuenta con terrenos por cultivar. Este es su octavo cr\u00e9dito con MFP, sabe que tiene que pagar todas sus cuotas puntualmente y est\u00e1 dispuesta a hacerlo. En su banco comunal es una socia muy solidaria y responsable. Con el cr\u00e9dito solicitado contratar\u00e1 jornaleros para que le brinden el apoyo en el mantenimiento de sus plantas, as\u00ed como en la cosecha. \n\n","en":"Paulina is 39 years old and a hard working woman who lives with her husband, 38 year old Clestinlo, and her five children who are the reason for her efforts.  The products that Paulina has managed to harvest have helped her get ahead in life.  Every morning she begins working her land to care for her cacao, coffee, and yam crops because she knows that the care will affect the quality of the harvest.  What she enjoys most about her work is caring for her crops and that makes her very happy when she sees them big and strong.\r\n\r\nShe\u2019s been doing this for 20 years and she considers the most difficult part to be transporting her harvest to San Francisco, where she can sell them for better prices.  For the time being she hopes to plant more cacao, since she has land to cultivate.  This will be her eighth loan through MFP, and she knows that she has to make all of her payments on time and she is prepared to do so.  She is considered to be very responsible within her communal bank and will use the money from this loan to hire field hands who will help maintain the crops and help with the harvest.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":763646,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to hire field hands","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-05-05T14:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Paulina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-04-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":900}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":900,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:17:29Z","rounded_local_amount":2553.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245174,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-05-05T22:14:39Z","paid_date":"2012-02-15T11:17:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":295844,"name":"Rosa Elva","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Rosa, reside en San Rafael Oriente, departamento de San Miguel, se dedica a la venta de medicina, vive con su mama, una hermana.

She is majoring in Accounting at Manab\u00ed Technical University; she\u2019s in her 7th semester.  She\u2019s been in the communal bank for 8 cycles and is the bank\u2019s Secretary.  She likes it because she gets help through the loans to have a business of her own to thus be able to continue with her studies.\r\n\r\nShe works Monday through Friday at a Cybercaf\u00e9 and also sells Avon brand catalogue products (beauty products, cosmetics, perfumes and women\u2019s accessories).  She works Monday through Friday afternoons because she attends classes in the morning.  She does her sales in her spare time although she also avails herself of the opportunity to sell to her coworkers and classmates.  She sells on credit and collects weekly.  She tells us that she\u2019s been doing this activity for two years and she does well.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to buy perfume, costume jewelry, cosmetics and creams, among other products.  Her goals are to complete her studies and own her own business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":763728,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":" to buy perfume, creams, costume jewelry, cosmetics, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2011-05-05T23:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zuleyka Alexandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-04-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":880,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2011-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2011-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2011-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2011-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2011-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2011-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":110}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":225,"local_amount":220,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:13:04Z","rounded_local_amount":225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211225229,"comment":null},{"amount":225,"local_amount":220,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:04:16Z","rounded_local_amount":225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216504020,"comment":null},{"amount":225,"local_amount":220,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:47:29Z","rounded_local_amount":225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221667965,"comment":null},{"amount":225,"local_amount":220,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T09:08:20Z","rounded_local_amount":225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227036714,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-05-08T19:17:02Z","paid_date":"2011-09-15T09:08:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":295890,"name":"Inmaculada Concepcion De Yungaqui Ii Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Los socios pertenecen al banco comunal \u201cURPIS D.

She worked hard and in 2003, using her start-up capital of 30,000 KGS, Gulnora started her own trade business.

Her loyal partners and customers were attracted by her optimistic attitude, responsibility and cheerfulness. \r\n<br>However, in June 2010, when violent clashes caused by the deposed political regime broke out in the city of Osh, Gulnora lost her business. Her shop was robbed and looted. But Gulnora isn't giving up and is ready to resume her lost business and continue to work. For this very reason, she is applying for a loan of 135,000 KGS, which she needs to restart her business. She plans to purchase a variety of detergents to resell at the local market.

I could be my own boss.\u201d \r\n \r\nNot long after that, Edwin and his wife, Maria, started a family-owned janitorial and handyman repair business. Thirty years later, the business is still going strong and now employs two additional workers to help manage a wide variety of jobs that range from installing tile in houses to gardening to cleaning office buildings.\r\n \r\nThe couple\u2019s favorite part of running a small business is the flexibility it affords them. They work hard, but have the freedom to create their own schedule and spend more time with family. \u201cAs my own boss there\u2019s nobody telling me what to do \u2013 but that also comes with responsibility. You have to be disciplined. You can\u2019t afford complaints from clients,\u201d said Edwin.\r\n \r\nDespite 30 years of experience and their strong work ethic, the recession has presented a significant challenge to the business: \u201cWhen the economy is bad, things are tough, because people don\u2019t have extra money to spend on fixing their houses.\u201d \r\n \r\nIn order to secure more work, Edwin and Maria needed capital, but many of the places they initially looked charged interest rates pushing 90%. Fortunately, their search also led them to Opportunity Fund, a local micro-lender, where they were approved for a $750 micro-loan (with an interest rate of 8%). With their loan, Edwin and Maria will be able to take on an extra account and build their credit for larger business loans in the future. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":764140,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"to take on an extra janitorial account and build their credit history.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"US","country":"United States","town":"Richmond, CA","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39.76 -98.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":132,"posted_date":"2011-05-06T01:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edwin And Maria","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-04-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":750,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":121.76},{"due_date":"2011-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":123.92},{"due_date":"2011-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":124.87},{"due_date":"2011-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":125.61},{"due_date":"2011-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":126.47},{"due_date":"2011-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":127.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.76},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.92},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.87},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.61},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":126.47},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":127.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":121.76,"local_amount":121.76,"processed_date":"2011-05-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-29T07:57:27Z","rounded_local_amount":121.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211284829,"comment":null},{"amount":123.92,"local_amount":123.92,"processed_date":"2011-06-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-22T07:59:30Z","rounded_local_amount":123.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":217381941,"comment":null},{"amount":124.87,"local_amount":124.87,"processed_date":"2011-07-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:20:38Z","rounded_local_amount":124.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221734791,"comment":null},{"amount":125.61,"local_amount":125.61,"processed_date":"2011-08-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-27T08:20:54Z","rounded_local_amount":125.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227105071,"comment":null},{"amount":126.47,"local_amount":126.47,"processed_date":"2011-09-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-20T08:09:57Z","rounded_local_amount":126.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232866404,"comment":null},{"amount":127.37,"local_amount":127.37,"processed_date":"2011-10-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T11:09:41Z","rounded_local_amount":127.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238682476,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-05-07T13:39:09Z","paid_date":"2011-11-15T11:09:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":296056,"name":"Anacleta","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La socia pertenece al banco comunal \u201cSAN ISIDRO D.

By increasing his sales he\u2019ll be able to meet expenses while becoming better known in the different places he sells because of having a good quality product.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 is known by the local merchants and in the various markets where he sells his products as being an honest, hard working man with a strong drive to improve in life providing his children with better opportunities in the society they are developing in.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":764144,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":" to renew his bee hives.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"M\u00f3rrope - Lambayeque","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2011-05-06T17:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jose De Los Santos","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-04-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1075}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1075,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-19T07:42:48Z","rounded_local_amount":3033.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":222205482,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-05-06T23:59:13Z","paid_date":"2011-08-19T07:42:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":296068,"name":"Bernardo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Bernardo tiene 63  a\u00f1os, es viudo y vive en su casa propia.
