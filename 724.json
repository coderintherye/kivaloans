She also offers a room for rent as an additional income. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 400 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, Nazaria is requesting a Php 27,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products to add in her inventory.

Hochi is 53 years old, and she is a mother of four adult children.  Her husband works at a pressure station and earns a minimum income of only 270 somoni or 55 dollars per month, and this is why the business brings in an additional income for the family.  The family has an average living minimum.  Hochi's youngest daughter, Nigora, helps her with the business.  Hochi's place of business is located among the rows of women's purses sales at the central Panshanbe market.  She primarily has loyal purse customers and also customers who leave for Russia and need to buy suitcases.  The photograph shows Hochi at the cash register on the day of loan disbursement.  She plans to use the 1500 somoni loan to bring in new types of purses and suitcases.

At the beginning of her entrepreneurial activity, she sold women's undergarments and had a small business turnover.  The selection of goods was also limited.  Salomat's husband works as a cook at a cafeteria, and his entire income gets used for family expenses.  Also, one of the client's sons works in Russia and sends them money for living expenses every month.  Salomat has been increasing her good turnover year after year with the help of the loans and used the resulting profits to marry off her daughter and repair her house.  Over the nine years of credit history, Salomat has not once violated the terms of the organization.

She has been selling children's clothing and shoes at a market for over ten years.  She has been obtaining loans from Arvand for over four years.  Marhabo works at the Panshanbe market in the city center of Khujand.  At the beginning of her entrepreneurial activity, her business assets amounted to only 600 dollars, and today her goods turnover expanded to 2000 dollars.  She previously brought in the merchandise from the wholesale market in Istaravshan, and now her youngest son travels for the merchandise to the city of Bishkek in the neighboring Kyrgyzstan.

In the Philippines, workers and most families only eat home-cooked meals in the evening because it is the time when all of the family members are home. This is not only a family tradition, but also a matter of convenience and frugality. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one or two people when it costs less to buy cooked rice and meat.  In addition to her food stall business, Alicia sells homemade snacks and pork meat for additional income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 600 Philippine Pesos (PHP) every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she requests a PHP 39, 000 loan.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nLeah operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, five peso's worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns profit by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the item. Her store is adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 700 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a 50,000-PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nLeah hopes to be able to expand soon.

She is a widow and a mother. She, together with her children, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nCatherine operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nCatherine hopes to be able to expand soon and dreams of being able to give her children a good and high-quality education through all her hard work on her business.

She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products through popular direct selling brands like Avon, The Fuller Life, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and others. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer who then has one month to pay. The dealer\u2019s prices to buy the merchandise are lower than the prices in the catalog, and the remainder of the customer's price is the profit that dealers can expect as their income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 4500 in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 25,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy merchandise and orders for her customers. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nErnelyn fervently hopes that her children will be able to graduate one day and hopes to grow her business in the coming years.

Since childhood Bakyt was included in the family farm, which was the main source of income for his own family. Since 2003 Bakyt started fattening and selling cattle with an initial investment amount of 23,000 som (KGS). Because of the tenacity and perseverance in the quest for a decent life for his family Bakyt worked tirelessly. Today, his farm with cows and sheep is developing successfully and brings a monthly income of about 20,000 som (KGS) from the sale of meat and dairy products.\r\n\r\nFor further development of his business Bakyt has turned to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan in the amount of 100,000 KGS for the purchase of bulls for fattening.

He is 62 years old and lives with his family--his wife, Narguli, and two sons who are 26 and 27 years old. Narguli works as a nurse in a local hospital, and their sons work for a local road service company. \r\n\r\nAlexander manages the agricultural business of the family, which is the main source of income for them. He grows various fruits and vegetables on 1.2 family-owned hectares of land and sells harvested products to local retailers. Also, the family has two milk cows. Narguli and Alexander produce cheese and sell it locally.

He says so because farming requires a lot of patience, hard work, optimism and \u2013 of course \u2013 funds.

","en":"Mankanay is 54 years old, married, and has raised two children. During the Soviet times, Mankanay milked cows at a collective farm, while her husband operated a combine harvester. After collective farms ceased to exist, Mankanay and her husband decided to start their own farm, raising and selling animals. They started out in 1995, with 20,000 KGS, and today their farm brings in 10,000 KGS per month from sales of dairy and meat. Also, Mankanay grows various crops for the animals on her own land, allowing her to save money on feed. With the goal of increasing the number of heads of cattle on her farm, Mankanay has turned to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 125,000 KGS, to purchase additional animals. Income from the loan will be used to expand her farm.

Vitoria has been engaged in this business for over four years and earns approximately 480 WST a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Vitoria joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Vitoria has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1650 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase harvesting equipment.  Vitoria is now requesting a new loan of 1750 WST which will be used to purchase general farm supplies and equipment.  The loan will be the fourth loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.

Caroline is 19 years old and lives in the town of Kyengera in the Kampala North region of Uganda. For the past 3 years, Caroline has been working hard to manage her poultry farm, which sells chicken. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Caroline has requested a loan of 400,000 Ugandan shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more chicken for resale, and will help Caroline to generate greater profits and pay school fees for herself. Caroline hopes that in the future she will be able to study catering. \r\n\r\nCaroline is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills training. The ELA program has increased Caroline's future prospects by helping her to improve her business.

Lazia is 20 years old and lives in the town of Kyengera in the Kampala North region of Uganda. She is married and has two children with one of them currently in school. For the past two years, Lazia has been working hard to manage her small shop, which sells shoes. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Lazia has requested a loan of 400,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more shoes for resale, and will help Lazia generate greater profits and pay school fees for her child. Lazia hopes that in the future she will be able to expand her business. \r\n\r\nLazia is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training. The ELA program has increased Lazia's future prospects by teaching her how to save.

Shalon is 16 years old and lives in the town of Kyengera in the Kampala North region of Uganda. For the past year, Shalon has been working hard to manage her small market, which sells food. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Shalon has requested a loan of 200,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy food for resale, and will help Shalon generate greater profits and buy books to help her through her studies. Shalon hopes that in the future she will be able to study nursing. \r\n\r\nShalon is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training. The ELA program has increased Shalon's future prospects by helping her improve her business.

He also works oven baking chicken, turkey, etc.  This is a secondary occupation which he learned from his father.  Alejandro is a hard-working, determined, very tenacious man who has a great desire to get ahead in life.  He has been working in his beauty products business since 2008 and earns 180 soles a week.  He will invest the loan that he receives thanks to Kiva in expanding his small business, so that he can bake birds and other things, by building a small <i>horno artesanal<\/i> (literally: an artisan's oven - these are most often made from clay, brick or stone) which will provide him with facilities and, of course, a lot more income.  One of Alejandro's dreams is to study for a degree so that he can become a great professional and, over time, enjoy a better type of life.  His loan officer believes him to be a good client and believes that he will make his loan repayments on time.\r\n\r\nAlejandro lives and works in Chinca, Chincha Alta, Per\u00fa. Chincha is named after its early Chincha culture.  The Chincha were celebrated for their advanced knowledge of agriculture and their maritime prowess. Today Chincha is an incredible mix of cultures, with a large Afro-Peruvian population, indigenous people and influences from the Spanish empire. The city, along with others near the Pacific coast, was damaged during the 2001 and 2007 Peru earthquakes but it has been preserved as it has been for much of its history.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":121.38,"image":{"id":928774,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to build an oven","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chincha","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2011-12-01T08:04:48Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alejandro Jesus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":102.96},{"due_date":"2012-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":104.92},{"due_date":"2012-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":108.76},{"due_date":"2012-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":115.58},{"due_date":"2012-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":116.98},{"due_date":"2012-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":122.4},{"due_date":"2012-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":125.74},{"due_date":"2012-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":131.2},{"due_date":"2012-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":135.15},{"due_date":"2012-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":140.1},{"due_date":"2012-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":145.59},{"due_date":"2012-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":150.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.47},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.22},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.69},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.3},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.85},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.92},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.2},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.29},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.81},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.7},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.81},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.74}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":39.47,"local_amount":102.96,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:37:07Z","rounded_local_amount":106.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250735428,"comment":null},{"amount":40.22,"local_amount":104.92,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:46:04Z","rounded_local_amount":108.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257142476,"comment":null},{"amount":41.69,"local_amount":108.76,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:57:31Z","rounded_local_amount":112.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263271068,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-12-21T09:58:24Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":362949,"name":"Pascal","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Pascal is 29 years old and married with one child.

It is in this hot, arid climate that we find the client's home and business.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":121.38,"image":{"id":928810,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy merchandise for the Christmas season (shoes)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ica","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2011-12-01T08:04:48Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":102.96},{"due_date":"2012-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":104.92},{"due_date":"2012-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":108.76},{"due_date":"2012-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":115.58},{"due_date":"2012-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":116.98},{"due_date":"2012-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":122.4},{"due_date":"2012-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":125.74},{"due_date":"2012-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":131.2},{"due_date":"2012-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":135.15},{"due_date":"2012-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":140.1},{"due_date":"2012-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":145.59},{"due_date":"2012-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":150.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.47},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.22},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.69},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.3},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.85},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.92},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.2},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.29},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.81},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.7},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.81},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.74}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":39.47,"local_amount":102.96,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:37:13Z","rounded_local_amount":106.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250735429,"comment":null},{"amount":40.22,"local_amount":104.92,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:46:10Z","rounded_local_amount":108.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257142477,"comment":null},{"amount":41.69,"local_amount":108.76,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:57:43Z","rounded_local_amount":112.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263271069,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-12-14T20:02:07Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":362980,"name":"Maria Elpidia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda Elpidia se dedica a la venta de cosm\u00e9ticos, desde hace m\u00e1s de 7 a\u00f1os que tiene este medio de vida.

This way, their father can provide them with both learning and food.  It's going very well for him, as he has good sales. He is a supplier to three important mills in the area, who are always waiting for him to bring them his crop to sell, as he produces one of the best crops in the area.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning, it was very complicated for him to carry out this work, as he didn't have a lot of knowledge.

In the future he wishes to have his own small farm, as when he rents, this takes away part of his earnings. \r\n\r\nIn addition, he wishes to set up a small store in his house, where his partner can sell merchandise and generate additional income for their household finances. \r\n\r\nThis will be his fourth loan with MFP.

Moreover, he is committed to once again making his instalment payments. \r\n\r\nWith the amount applied for, 1,500 soles, he will buy products for stocking the store in his house, and also spend a bit to pay laborers, so that he can maintain his small farm.

They live together in their own home, and they want to have a good future.  Ines started up a grocery store where she sells rice, sugar and preserves.  She started this business 3 months ago, and it is going very well.  Once her neighbors found out about the store, they did not hesitate to buy her products.  Ines likes her work because she receives her neighbors with a lot of happiness and she tends to them in a friendly way.  What she considers most difficult is when she runs out of things quickly, as she needs capital to invest again.  With the loan she is requesting, she will be able to buy more grocery products such as a variety of detergents, cookies, rice, noodles, and other items.  This will be her first loan with MFP, and she is grateful for the opportunity they are providing her to accomplish her work.
