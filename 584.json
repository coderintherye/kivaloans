He started his business in 2001.  In 2004 his wife, Altantsetseg, also began working as a photographer too. His daughter, age 25, helps with the family business by picking up the films in order to process them at a laboratory. They prefer to use advanced cameras in order to provide quality service for their customers. So they began using digital cameras to capture images electronically which allowed them to print their pictures in a minute. They also offered a very special service of taking one's picture with Mongolian traditional clothes on. They are planning to continue and expand their business in the future.

Marites is requesting a new loan of 12000 PHP which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future. This loan will be the 7th loan taken out by Marites from ASKI.

D. is from Sta. Rosa, Gamu, Ilagan, Isabela. She is 39 years old. Perla is married and has 3 adult-aged children. To make a living, Perla owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising pigs. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for fattening and for sale. Perla has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Perla joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Perla has successfully repaid a previous loan of 15,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. Perla is requesting a new loan of 17000 PHP which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This loan will be the 7th loan taken out by Perla from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

M. is from Sta. Rosa, Gamu, Ilagan, Isabela. She is 49 years old. Marilyn is married and has 3 adult-aged children. To make a living, Marilyn owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for fattening and sale. Marilyn has been engaged in her business for over 29 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Marilyn joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Marilyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 13,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. Marilyn is requesting a new loan of 15000 PHP which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future. This loan will be the 4th loan taken out by Marilyn from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

F. is from Sta. Rosa, Gamu, Ilagan, Isabela. She is 50 years old. Lorna is married and has 3 adult-aged children. To make a living, Lorna owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting and harvesting a variety of vegetables for sale. Lorna has been engaged in her business for over four years and earns approximately 4000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Lorna joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Lorna has successfully repaid a previous loan of 13,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings and young crops to raise. Lorna is requesting a new loan of 15000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings and young crops to raise. This loan will be the 8th loan taken out by Lorna from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from operating tricycle transport services. Josie has been engaged in her business for over 20 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Josie joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Josie has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to repair existing vehicle for better service. Josie is requesting a new loan of 20000 PHP which will be used to purchase tires and other accessories. This loan will be the 7th loan taken out by Josie from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

She is 50 years old. Yolanda is the group leader of a four member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nYolanda is married and has seven adult-aged children. To make a living, she plants and harvests a variety of vegetables to sell. She has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately $47 a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Yolanda joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 13,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings and young crops to raise. \r\n\r\nYolanda is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful micro-finance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva

is a 52-year-old tractor driver. He and his family live in Babau Village, about 15 km from the city of Kupang. He is married to Feby, a 48-year-old woman and they have been blessed with 4 children namely: \r\n1.\\tDesta, 20 years old, working in rice mills \r\n2.\\tDesti, 17 years old, who is in the 3rd year of vocational school\r\n3.\\tDoni, 14 years old, in the 3rd year of junior high school\r\n4.\\tDani, 9 years old in the 3rd grade of elementary school \r\nYopi has been working as a tractor driver for 2 years. At that time he bought a tractor with his own money. Incidentally Yopi\u2019s house is situated close to the area of rice fields, which is why Yopi bought a tractor in order to look for a better income.\r\nHowever, the tractor cannot be used every day because farmers who commonly use his tractor service are seasonal farmers. Within one year the farmers could only grow rice two times, so there are many days where Yopi is not able to use his tractor. This situation makes Yopi unable rely on the income from his tractor.\r\nYopi realizes that in his village there is only a rice milling machine, so that many farmers need to stand in a line to grind the rice. Yopi plans take this opportunity as a new effort to increase his income.\r\nYopi is requesting a loan amounting to IDR 10,000,000 from TLM. He is sure that buying the rice milling machine will greatly help farmers in his village so they do not have to queue for too long and spend money for transport as he plans to set the location for the rice milling machine near to their rice fields.

Edward has been farming for the past five years, making a monthly income of 10,000 KES. \r\n<br>Edward was introduced to Kiva partner, KADET by an already registered customer. He has been a good client who repays his loans well. This is his third loan, with which he plans to buy farm inputs and some animals (for fattening, to be sold at a profit) and hire machinery for preparing the land. Wheat has proved to be doing well in his area due to good climatic conditions. With the profits Edward hopes to make from this loan, he plans to reinvest in the farm and plant more acres of wheat.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The rest of the income comes from agricultural activities: Konstantin and Leila have two cows and their dairy products are sold locally. Also the family owns 1.85 ha of agricultural land, where maize, wheat, haricot beans, potatoes and apple trees are grown. Part of the harvested fruits and vegetables are consumed within the family and another part is sold on the local market. Also Konstantin has 4 oxen. He uses them for transportation of wood from the forest.

comes from the village of Kvemo Khvedureti in the Kareli District. He is 23 years old and lives with his wife Natia, two children and parents. Omar and Natia are leading the family agricultural activities. Their daughter is two years old and their son is one month old.  The parents are retired. \r\n\r\nThe family has two cows. Their milk is used for cheese production. The cheese is sold locally. In addition, they own one hectare of agricultural land where potatoes, carrots, beets and onions are grown. Some of the vegetables are consumed by the family, but most of them are sold on the local market. \r\n\r\nWith the requested credit, Omar will purchase potato and carrot seeds and fertilizers.

A., a married father of one child, is a hardworking man who operates a bakery in a rented facility near the market of Shohmansur, where he sells his breads. Odiljon, who is helped by both his brother and sister in this business, is requesting a loan of  USD1500 to purchase more flour for his enterprise. Prior to starting the bakery, he grew vegetables at home to sell at the market.  <p>\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International <p>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes its role as a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History <p>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC, and communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Her goals are to expand her business and to hire someone to help her in her workshop since the demand for her services is high throughout the year.  Only during the months of May, June and July do her sales tend to drop.  However, throughout the year she receives private customers in her home.  \r\n\r\nHaydee lives together with her husband, her 24 year-old daughter and her 4 year-old grandson.  Her daughter is studying civil construction.  Haydee's dream on a personal level is to be able to better provide for her family's well-being.\r\n\r\nHaydee is very grateful for the loan she has been offered by Fondo Esperanza since it will enable her to invest in her business and make more profit.  She finds the meetings to be very pleasant and she shares a lot with the other members of her community bank.  The training sessions have enabled her to incorporate different accounting techniques into her business, above all as regards the recording of incomings and outgoings in her business.\r\n\r\nTalcahuano is a municipality and city-port in B\u00edob\u00edo region, in the south of Chile.  It is known as one of the main ports in the country.  Its name in Mapudungun (Mapuche language) means 'thunderous sky'.  It has a very attractive natural landscape, owing to the combination of rivers, sea, fertile plains, meadows and mountains, with beautiful vegetation.  Its economy revolves around its port, its naval base and an important industrial area with iron and steel companies, oil refineries, petrochemical companies, cement companies, gas companies, etc."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":756095,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"to buy an industrial overlock sewing machine and materials for her sewing, specifically fabric","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CL","country":"Chile","town":"Talcahuano","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-30 -71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":157,"posted_date":"2011-04-26T11:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Haydee","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-04-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CLP","disbursal_amount":413197,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":48134},{"due_date":"2011-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":50220},{"due_date":"2011-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":50851},{"due_date":"2011-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":51489},{"due_date":"2011-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":52135},{"due_date":"2011-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":52790},{"due_date":"2011-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":53453},{"due_date":"2011-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":54125}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.84},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.39},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.76},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.15},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.56},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.98},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.43},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.89}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":104.84,"local_amount":48134,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:56:25Z","rounded_local_amount":49207.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206150312,"comment":null},{"amount":220.15,"local_amount":101071,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:11:16Z","rounded_local_amount":103325.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211223403,"comment":null},{"amount":225.71,"local_amount":103624,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:03:09Z","rounded_local_amount":105935.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216502377,"comment":null},{"amount":231.41,"local_amount":106243,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:45:22Z","rounded_local_amount":108613.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221666374,"comment":null},{"amount":117.89,"local_amount":54125,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T09:06:00Z","rounded_local_amount":55332.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227035231,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-04-26T16:25:40Z","paid_date":"2011-09-15T09:06:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":292857,"name":"Ronald","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ronald M.

His wife is a businesswoman and they have three children aged between nine years old and two months old. They hope to educate their children to the university level. Livingstone operates motorcycles in Kakamega. Kakamega is a rich agricultural region in the western part of Kenya. The region is known for its large-scale production of sugarcane and thus it is called the sugarbelt region. \r\n\r\nBesides this business, Livingstone runs a clothing sales shop. He has been running this business for ten years and has managed to give employment to one person. His motorcycle business is profitable and his major challenge is weather changes: during the rainy seasons, the roads become impassable and people prefer to use vans.

It has three members who know each other very well.  They work together and also have their own businesses.  Together they have managed to get ahead.  Here we will provide details of their different business activities:\r\n\r\nSantos Cristina L\u00f3pez R. sells products.  She has a grocery store and a bicycle parts business.  She has several years experience in running this type of business which means that she has a very good customer base.  In her business, you can find a little bit of everything, both food products and, at the same time, a variety of bicycle parts.  This mode of transport is very popular in her area since it enables people to get to work and school and is also used for recreational purposes.\r\n\r\nCristina's business has been experiencing significant growth.  She now has electricity and can sell products that require refrigeration such as cold cuts, soft drinks popsicles and dairy products.\r\n\r\nCristina will use her loan to buy merchandise so that she can better stock her business and have a little bit of everything available so that she can meet her customer demand.\r\n\r\nNohem\u00ed del Carmen R. sells products.  She sells American clothes.  She has been in this business for four months.  Before this she used to have a small grocery store which she had to abandon.  Once they installed electricity in the area, the bigger businesses bought refrigeration equipment and she didn't have enough capital to invest in her business.  This meant that her business declined.  For this reason, she decided to start another business activity in order to make money.  She set up her new business selling American clothes.  She goes out to sell to her neighbors and in neighboring areas.  She makes her sales both for cash and on credit.  She uses the income from this business to cover her personal expenses and her household expenses.\r\n\r\nNohem\u00ed will use her loan to buy a bundle of American summer clothes so that she can satisfy her customers.\r\n\r\nSantos Juli\u00e1n L\u00f3pez R. is a small farmer.  He grows basic grains.

They have a variety of jobs such as selling underwear, perfume, jewelry, fish, and sewing.\r\n\r\nAt the back of the group in the photograph is Carmen with the light brown hair, lilac-coloured t-shirt, black sweater, and pink complexion. She makes all types of clothing and works every day of the week in the afternoons. Her workshop is located inside her house. Most of her customers are private individuals who primarily come to her to have alterations made to their clothes. She buys her supplies in Santiago where people with businesses can get lower prices, and it\u2019s also more convenient too. She can get her sewing machines mended there also.\r\n\r\nWith this loan Carmen plans to buy fabric and thread so she can have more supplies on hand. Her goal one day is to have a store where she can sell the items she makes. Currently she is making bedding (sheets and pillow cases) which have to be done by hand so she only does this by special order. She would like to have schools and businesses as customers.\r\n\r\nCarmen lives with her two children aged 13 and 22 and her sister. Her younger son would like to have his own business so he helps Carmen with the paperwork, deliveries of clothing to customers, and buying supplies.\r\n\r\nShe is very grateful for the loan from Kiva partner Fondo Esperanza as it has given her the opportunity to get her business going on a better footing. The group meetings are enjoyable as the members share experiences and information--everyone communicates with and supports each other. \r\n\r\nLinares is an important town in the Maule region located in the centre of the country. Agriculture is very important, and grapes for export are of increasing importance. Cereal crops (rice, wheat, maize, oats) and vegetables (beets, cabbage, lettuce, chard) and fruit grow well. Linares is the main producer of rice in Chile with 78% of national production coming from this province, especially from the community of

When the real estate bubble burst, he like many in the construction industry went from having more work than he could handle to no work at all and his license as a contractor went inactive. \r\n \r\nNow, Caleb is ready to start working on big projects again, but this time as his own boss. \u201cWhen I was working for general contractors, they weren\u2019t even around most of the time. They\u2019d leave me in charge of the crew and occasionally check in on the progress, but I was doing the work.\u201d \r\n \r\nCaleb has never taken on debt, which, until recently, seemed like a good thing. However, because he avoided things like credit cards in the past, Caleb hasn\u2019t built up a credit history. Not only does this make it difficult to secure a bank loan, but also a contractor\u2019s license. \r\n \r\n\u201cBefore the recession, [to secure a license] they\u2019d look at your performance and if there were any negative marks on your record. Now they look at your credit score, and if you don\u2019t have a credit history that license gets a lot more expensive,\u201d explained Caleb. \r\n \r\nWhen Caleb asked his bank for a small business loan to help him cover the costs of the license and insurance, which would allow him to take on a crew and larger jobs, they weren\u2019t interested in providing the small amount he needed. Instead, the bank referred him to his local microlender, Opportunity Fund, where he was approved for a $3,500 microloan. \r\n \r\nWith the loan, Caleb successfully secured his license, bond, and liability insurance. These three key elements will now help him grow his business. When asked if he had any favorite project to work on, he listed everything from elaborate door systems in Maui to decks in Marin County to old Victorian-style homes in San Francisco. \u201cI love being able to see the improvement; to look at what I\u2019ve done compared to what was there before. I like all the jobs I do, now that I think about it.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2136.24,"image":{"id":754230,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction","sector":"Construction","use":"to

came to Grameen America two years ago looking for an opportunity. She loved to cook and was always being praised for her talent in the kitchen, but had no way of transforming that gift into professional success. Now, Maria runs her own business selling ice cream and other desserts out of her food truck. She used her first three Grameen America loans to get her business off the ground and acquire the necessary licensing and permit stickers. Now, she is seeking a fourth loan of 3,000 USD to stock up on ice cream and other ingredients and to renew her permit sticker so she can continue growing her business doing what she loves. Maria hopes to one day buy a food cart big enough for her to cook and serve a wide array of her favorite foods, from ice cream to tamales.

The Mongolian winter is one of the harshest in the world. The temperature in winter time, especially at night, drops to -40 degrees of Celsius. Therefore, the houses should be well-insulated from the cold. Currently most households in Ulaanbaatar city use coal fired stoves for heating which pollutes the air to dangerous level. The Mongolian government takes some measures to improve the air quality by helping to replace coal fired stoves to gas ones and improve the insulation of the houses. Well-insulated houses require less charcoal to burn, emitting less poisonous smoke into the air and helps to save on heating costs of households. \n\nThe loan he is asking for will be used to pay for insulation materials for the walls, double-glazed windows and other building materials to finish the house and to make the house warm and well-insulated from the cold.

She has had her business for around four years, cooking foods and delivering them to people. She plans to use this loan to invest in her business by buying rice, beans, cooking oil, meat and chairs. She will use the additional profits to save and supply some needs for her only child and home.

Sometimes she is able to save some money in her bank account.\r\n\r\nSara has never had loans from other banks. She learned about Hluvuku through an enrollment effort. This is Sara's third Hluvuku loan, and she is asking for 9,000 meticais to buy merchandise (juice, beans, broths, onions and other items) to increase the amount of merchandise she has. The previous loans were for 3,500 meticais and 3,000 meticais, and both were for the business.\r\n\r\nShe promises to make her payments on time so she can take out more loans in the future. She intends to ask for more loans to finish building some bedrooms and building her shop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":204.19,"image":{"id":756482,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery

She has had her own business selling basic goods for over 15 years. She doesn't have any employees, and has monthly earnings of around 3000 to 4000 meticais, which she uses for household expenses while managing to save a portion in her bank account.\r\n\r\nShe has never taken loans from other banks, and learned of Hluvuku through a friend who is a client of the institution. This is her second loan with Hluvuku. The loan is for 20,000 meticais and she plans to purchase construction materials (sand, cement, beams, and other items) to start construction of her residence. The previous loan was for 11,000 meticais and was used for her business.\r\n\r\nShe is committed to repaying on schedule to be able to access future loans. She plans to request new loans to continue with her construction and to increase her inventory.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":431.18,"image":{"id":756511,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

She goes from door to door and sells from the Ch\u00e2teau market to a customer base made up of men and women.  Mrs C. hopes to generate an average monthly profit of 30,000 FCFA which she will reinvest in the business and use to meet her family's everyday needs.  Like the other group members, she wishes to boost her business revenues through this partnership with Soro Yiriwaso."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":756525,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"to purchase traditional cloths (finished Dali or Koba)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Segou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14 -6","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2011-04-24T19:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariam                  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata         ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yaya                     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sitan    ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam    ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Malado          ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maman   Doufi\u00e9  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-04-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":525000,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":87500},{"due_date":"2011-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":87500},{"due_date":"2011-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":87500},{"due_date":"2011-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":87500},{"due_date":"2011-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":87500},{"due_date":"2011-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":87500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.84},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.84},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":195.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":195.83,"local_amount":87500,"processed_date":"2011-05-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T12:00:26Z","rounded_local_amount":88237.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211301518,"comment":null},{"amount":195.84,"local_amount":87500,"processed_date":"2011-06-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:52:16Z","rounded_local_amount":88237.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216581099,"comment":null},{"amount":195.83,"local_amount":87500,"processed_date":"2011-07-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:30:29Z","rounded_local_amount":88237.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221750856,"comment":null},{"amount":195.83,"local_amount":87500,"processed_date":"2011-08-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T10:19:52Z","rounded_local_amount":88237.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227120161,"comment":null},{"amount":195.84,"local_amount":87500,"processed_date":"2011-09-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T10:13:30Z","rounded_local_amount":88237.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232882033,"comment":null},{"amount":195.83,"local_amount":87500,"processed_date":"2011-10-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T11:23:18Z","rounded_local_amount":88237.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238699135,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-04-25T00:28:55Z","paid_date":"2011-11-15T11:23:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":293052,"name":"Chheng","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Chheng T. is 27 years old and sells items such as cooking ingredients, sweets, and soft drinks in front of her house.

He is planning to complete the building work by laying insulation and bricks to the walls and by replacing the coal-fired heating stove to low-pressure central heating system, which reduces the emission of poisonous smoke into the air and saves on heating cost. Ulaanbaatar city's air quality is at dangerous level, few times exceeding the normal level.
