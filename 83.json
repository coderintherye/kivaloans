We intend to set up sales points in the various neighborhoods where people raise sheep, goats, and chickens. In general, it is very productive to set up such a project since breeders have to find feed daily for their livestock or their poultry. This project will allow us to create work for all the members of the group, since each of us will be responsible for managing one of the sales points in our eco-village. Thus, thanks to Kiva, we will be able to create jobs for young people who will then no longer have to consider taking off by sea to immigrate illegally, incurring who knows what consequences. <P> <B>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva volunteer<P><\/b>Notre projet consiste \u00e0 l'achat et au stockage d'aliments pour animaux d'\u00e9levage et ensuite les revendre aux \r\n\r\n\u00e9l\u00e8veurs qui sont dans les villes et les diff\u00e9rents quartiers de Dakar.

Regardless, at 25 years old, she manages her business very well.  As a result of her marriage, she realized that it was necessary to have an additional source of income apart from that of her husband's since it was not enough to have only one of them cover their living expenses.  Once she knew that she was pregnant, she decided to open a business in the market.  Currently, she has already had 8 months of business selling clothes at her stall.  Despite the new born baby who is a few months old, she works daily at her job.  She does not believe the baby is an inconvenience; rather, th baby gives her strength everyday to leave for work.

As a result, she decided to dedicate herself to selling food in the market during the evenings.  <p>\r\n\r\nSince it went well, she decided to rent another location at the market to work her small restaurant.  Today, with the passage of time and thanks to her hard work, Aurelia has managed to re-open her general store as well as continue to run her restaurant.

Simply put, SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women through an arrangement called a sale and leaseback transaction. More specifically, when a client needs working capital, SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extends a loan to her to facilitate the transaction, and then leases the equipment back to her. <P>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":140642,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To purchase additional stocks of shoes and African cloth.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-03-17T12:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":850,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Caroline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-04-01T04:57:14Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":1000000,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-05-01T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:32:06Z","rounded_local_amount":100342.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":198112,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-06-01T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:34:41Z","rounded_local_amount":100342.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":225099,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-07-01T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:37:51Z","rounded_local_amount":100342.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":254317,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-08-01T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:41:59Z","rounded_local_amount":100342.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283158,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-09-01T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-16T07:13:14Z","rounded_local_amount":100342.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":313252,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-10-01T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-12T07:17:20Z","rounded_local_amount":100342.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":344446,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":170,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2008-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T03:20:19Z","rounded_local_amount":200685,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347569,"comment":null},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-17T09:15:55Z","rounded_local_amount":100342.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970189,"comment":null},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:17:21Z","rounded_local_amount":100342.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886439,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-03-18T04:57:14Z","paid_date":"2009-02-15T15:17:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":41186,"name":"Cirila Alejandrina","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Over the past twenty years, Cirila and her husband have made great strides and put in much effort to advance their business in the clothing trade.

Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are not considered to be credit-worthy by financial institutions because they lack tangible assets that can serve as collateral. As such, low income women in Tanzania typically receive poor financial support and in turn only limited access to basic needs and services. <P> Fortunately, SELFINA has been a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women in Tanzania. Simply put, SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women through an arrangement called a sale and leaseback transaction.

Edither seeks a loan in order to purchase additional stocks of shoes, cosmetics, bags, and clothing. She thanks you for your support. <P>SELFINA is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback micro-finance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are not considered to be credit-worthy by financial institutions because they lack tangible assets that can serve as collateral. As such, low income women in Tanzania typically receive poor financial support and in turn only limited access to basic needs and services. <P> Fortunately, SELFINA has been a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women in Tanzania. Simply put, SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women through an arrangement called a sale and leaseback transaction. More specifically, when a client needs working capital, SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extends a loan to her to facilitate the transaction, and then leases the equipment back to her. <P>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":140674,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To purchase additional stocks of shoes, clothes, bags, and cosmetics.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-03-18T21:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edither","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-04-03T02:42:04Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":43,"local_amount":50588.24,"processed_date":"2008-05-03T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:32:29Z","rounded_local_amount":50761.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":200092,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":43,"local_amount":50588.24,"processed_date":"2008-06-03T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:34:48Z","rounded_local_amount":50761.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227086,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":43,"local_amount":50588.24,"processed_date":"2008-07-03T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:38:01Z","rounded_local_amount":50761.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":256326,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":43,"local_amount":50588.24,"processed_date":"2008-08-03T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:42:04Z","rounded_local_amount":50761.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":285067,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":43,"local_amount":50588.24,"processed_date":"2008-09-03T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-19T07:16:39Z","rounded_local_amount":50761.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315260,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":43,"local_amount":50588.24,"processed_date":"2008-10-03T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-13T07:10:00Z","rounded_local_amount":50761.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":346833,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":39.5,"local_amount":46470.56,"processed_date":"2008-11-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T03:20:24Z","rounded_local_amount":46629.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347572,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2008-12-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:05:29Z","rounded_local_amount":50171.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970192,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-01-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:09:58Z","rounded_local_amount":50171.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886442,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-02-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:00:04Z","rounded_local_amount":50171.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20435728,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-03-20T02:42:04Z","paid_date":"2009-03-16T21:00:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":41212,"name":"Delia","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Delia is a member of \"The Carnations\" communal bank and lives in Picota in the San Mart\u00edn region of Peru.

Working seven days a week, and 9 to12 hours a day, she earns about $430 each month from this business. She is assisted by her hursband, children, and one employee. Fatuma has already received and successfully repaid one loan from SELFINA, and now seeks a new loan in order to purchase additional stocks of soap, rice, sugar, biscuits, and cloth. She hopes that this loan will enable her to increase her monthly profits by approximately $175. In the future, Fatuma plans to open a new business. She thanks you for your support. <P>SELFINA is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback micro-finance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are not considered to be credit-worthy by financial institutions because they lack tangible assets that can serve as collateral. As such, low income women in Tanzania typically receive poor financial support and in turn only limited access to basic needs and services. <P> Fortunately, SELFINA has been a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women in Tanzania. Simply put, SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women through an arrangement called a sale and leaseback transaction. More specifically, when a client needs working capital, SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extends a loan to her to facilitate the transaction, and then leases the equipment back to her.

This is Asha P.. She is 37 years old, single, and has three children (between the ages of 10 and 14 years old) as well as one other dependent. In 2000, Asha established her general store business. Working six days a week, and 9 to 12 hours a day, she earns about $170 each month from this business. She is assisted by her children. Asha has already received and successfully repaid one loan from SELFINA, and now seeks a new loan in order to purchase additional stock in bulk. In the future, Asha plans to incrase the quantity and range of her stock. She thanks you for your support. <P>SELFINA is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback micro-finance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are not considered to be credit-worthy by financial institutions because they lack tangible assets that can serve as collateral. As such, low income women in Tanzania typically receive poor financial support and in turn only limited access to basic needs and services. <P> Fortunately, SELFINA has been a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women in Tanzania. Simply put, SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women through an arrangement called a sale and leaseback transaction. More specifically, when a client needs working capital, SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extends a loan to her to facilitate the transaction, and then leases the equipment back to her.

She thanks you for your support. <P>SELFINA is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback micro-finance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are not considered to be credit-worthy by financial institutions because they lack tangible assets that can serve as collateral. As such, low income women in Tanzania typically receive poor financial support and in turn only limited access to basic needs and services. <P> Fortunately, SELFINA has been a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women in Tanzania. Simply put, SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women through an arrangement called a sale and leaseback transaction. More specifically, when a client needs working capital, SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extends a loan to her to facilitate the transaction, and then leases the equipment back to her."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":140707,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","use":"To expand her business by purchasing additional clothes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-03-18T23:50:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sophia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-04-03T15:09:13Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":1200000,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":120000},{"due_date":"2008-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":120000},{"due_date":"2008-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":120000},{"due_date":"2008-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":120000},{"due_date":"2008-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":120000},{"due_date":"2008-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":120000},{"due_date":"2008-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":120000},{"due_date":"2008-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":120000},{"due_date":"2009-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":120000},{"due_date":"2009-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":120000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":103,"local_amount":120585.37,"processed_date":"2008-05-03T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:32:30Z","rounded_local_amount":121591.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":200095,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":103,"local_amount":120585.37,"processed_date":"2008-06-03T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:34:56Z","rounded_local_amount":121591.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227089,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":103,"local_amount":120585.37,"processed_date":"2008-07-03T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:38:01Z","rounded_local_amount":121591.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":256329,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":103,"local_amount":120585.37,"processed_date":"2008-08-03T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:42:04Z","rounded_local_amount":121591.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":285070,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":103,"local_amount":120585.37,"processed_date":"2008-09-03T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-19T07:16:46Z","rounded_local_amount":121591.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315263,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":103,"local_amount":120585.37,"processed_date":"2008-10-03T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-13T07:10:02Z","rounded_local_amount":121591.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":346836,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":99.5,"local_amount":116487.78,"processed_date":"2008-11-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T03:21:17Z","rounded_local_amount":117459.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347578,"comment":null},{"amount":102.5,"local_amount":120000,"processed_date":"2008-12-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:06:18Z","rounded_local_amount":121001.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970198,"comment":null},{"amount":102.5,"local_amount":120000,"processed_date":"2009-01-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:10:11Z","rounded_local_amount":121001.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886448,"comment":null},{"amount":102.5,"local_amount":120000,"processed_date":"2009-02-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:01:02Z","rounded_local_amount":121001.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20435734,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-03-20T15:09:13Z","paid_date":"2009-03-16T21:01:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":41235,"name":"Bocc Jeff Group","description":{"languages":["fr"],"texts":{"fr":"We would like to purchase dying products to dye and then sew, embroider and knit clothing in order to make high-quality products that we will sell to tourists, as we live in a seaside region that welcomes many visitors every day.

For example, she would like to start a charcoal-selling business: these small, black, dirty pieces of dry earth are important to the people of Tanzania because they rely on charcoal to cook meals. Indeed, many Tanzanians still use small coal pots, in which they arrange mkaa (charcoal) and add either paper, dry grass, old plastic bags, or kerosene in order to light them. The fire requires constant fanning to ignite and maintain the flame, and makes cooking quite a hot and laborious task.

In the future, Amina plans to increase the quantity and range of her stock. She thanks you for your support. <P>SELFINA is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback micro-finance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are not considered to be credit-worthy by financial institutions because they lack tangible assets that can serve as collateral. As such, low income women in Tanzania typically receive poor financial support and in turn only limited access to basic needs and services. <P> Fortunately, SELFINA has been a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women in Tanzania. Simply put, SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women through an arrangement called a sale and leaseback transaction. More specifically, when a client needs working capital, SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extends a loan to her to facilitate the transaction, and then leases the equipment back to her. <P>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":140716,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase additional (200 trays) eggs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-03-19T16:40:25Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Amina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-04-03T18:09:36Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":800000,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2008-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2008-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2008-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2008-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2008-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2008-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2008-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2009-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2009-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":80000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2008-05-03T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:32:30Z","rounded_local_amount":82635,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":200097,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2008-06-03T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:34:57Z","rounded_local_amount":82635,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227091,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2008-07-03T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:38:02Z","rounded_local_amount":82635,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":256331,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2008-08-03T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:42:04Z","rounded_local_amount":82635,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":285072,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2008-09-03T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-19T07:16:46Z","rounded_local_amount":82635,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315265,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2008-10-03T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-13T07:10:04Z","rounded_local_amount":82635,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":346838,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2008-11-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T03:21:32Z","rounded_local_amount":82635,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347580,"comment":null},{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2008-12-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:05:45Z","rounded_local_amount":82635,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970200,"comment":null},{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2009-01-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:10:40Z","rounded_local_amount":82635,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886450,"comment":null},{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2009-02-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:00:17Z","rounded_local_amount":82635,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20435735,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-03-20T18:09:36Z","paid_date":"2009-03-16T21:00:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":41243,"name":"Rosalina Elvira","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"<p>  Se\u00f1ora Rosalina belongs to the Women of Progress Communal Bank.

In fact, if you are a regular lender on kiva.org, you have probably heard the term \"kuku\" and you might be wondering who or what are \"kuku\"? In Swahili, \"kuku\" means chickens, and raising them for sale is a popular business in Tanzania for a number of reasons. First, they require little start-up capital: you can start with just one or two kuku and either add more as your business expands or wait for them to (naturally) multiply! Second, kuku do not need a great deal of space or any special facilities so you can normally just let them run around your garden or compound. Third, kuku produce eggs while they grow, and the eggs can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein. Mary is sure that there are many other reasons why raising kuku is so popular--she speculates that they may be friendlier or prettier than other animals--but she hopes you now have a better understanding of the popularity of kuku in Tanzania."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":140720,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase 300 additional kuku (chickens) to raise and sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-03-19T16:40:25Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-04-04T00:16:29Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":1200000,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":120000},{"due_date":"2008-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":120000},{"due_date":"2008-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":120000},{"due_date":"2008-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":120000},{"due_date":"2008-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":120000},{"due_date":"2008-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":120000},{"due_date":"2008-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":120000},{"due_date":"2008-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":120000},{"due_date":"2009-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":120000},{"due_date":"2009-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":120000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":103,"local_amount":120585.37,"processed_date":"2008-05-04T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:32:47Z","rounded_local_amount":121591.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201010,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":103,"local_amount":120585.37,"processed_date":"2008-06-04T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:35:03Z","rounded_local_amount":121591.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":228152,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":103,"local_amount":120585.37,"processed_date":"2008-07-04T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:38:08Z","rounded_local_amount":121591.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257240,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":103,"local_amount":120585.37,"processed_date":"2008-08-04T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:42:10Z","rounded_local_amount":121591.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":286001,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":103,"local_amount":120585.37,"processed_date":"2008-09-04T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-20T07:25:59Z","rounded_local_amount":121591.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":316195,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":103,"local_amount":120585.37,"processed_date":"2008-10-04T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-15T07:16:29Z","rounded_local_amount":121591.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347869,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":99.5,"local_amount":116487.78,"processed_date":"2008-11-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T03:21:37Z","rounded_local_amount":117459.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347581,"comment":null},{"amount":102.5,"local_amount":120000,"processed_date":"2008-12-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:05:50Z","rounded_local_amount":121001.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970201,"comment":null},{"amount":102.5,"local_amount":120000,"processed_date":"2009-01-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:11:06Z","rounded_local_amount":121001.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886451,"comment":null},{"amount":102.5,"local_amount":120000,"processed_date":"2009-02-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:00:26Z","rounded_local_amount":121001.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20435736,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-03-21T00:16:29Z","paid_date":"2009-03-16T21:00:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":41245,"name":"Soledad","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"<p>Se\u00f1ora Soledad  belongs to the Progress Communal Bank.

She thanks you for your support. <P>SELFINA is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback micro-finance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are not considered to be credit-worthy by financial institutions because they lack tangible assets that can serve as collateral.

Today they will get their requested loan amounts approved, and are eagerly chatting in their native language, Kaqchiquel, sharing family happenings and business ideas.  All sixteen women know each other well, living as neighbors in the nearby community of San Jorge la Laguna, a town perfectly situated between the region\u2019s capital of Solol\u00e1 and its tourist capital, Panajachel.  In addition to being neighbors, they are now confidants in a solidarity group, sixteen women who are learning to support each other in struggles and in triumphs.  All sixteen women were successful with their first loan this past year, and are looking forward to taking on the challenge of slightly bigger loans this time around.\r\n\r\n<P>The women are artisans, born into a culture rich in beaded jewelry and weavings.  All of the women have businesses related to these crafts.  They will invest their loans in tiny translucent beads of every color, with which they will make intricate bracelets, necklaces, and other crafts, like eyeglass chains.  Others will invest in thread for weaving.  They are skilled in the art of weaving fine huipiles, the traditional Mayan blouse, which can take up to three months to make.  They also weave skirts, scarves, and head wraps.  All the women are \u2018ambulantes\u2019, meaning they carry their products with them, most often in a basket on their head, through the streets of Panajachel, bargaining with and selling to the hundreds of tourists that come through the town.  Laura Teresa, a voice for the group, shares that for every 1000 quetzales of investment they will earn about 2000 quetzales.  \r\n\r\n<P>All of the women have families, the younger women having two or three children each, and some of the older women having as many as nine children, many of whom are still under their care.  They have all been working as ambulantes for about six years, and started their businesses to help support their families.  The women of Inocentes are eager for their second loan, very pleased with the success they found after the first investment.  They found they were able to not only increase their inventory, but also expand the variety, keeping them a step ahead of the competition.  They are asking for a loan of 34,800 quetzales, $4550, ranging from $100 to $400 per person.  \r\n\r\n<P>The three women who are not pictured were at the meeting but had to leave before the picture was taken to take care of their

H. lives in Yavan. He is 55 years old, is married and has seven children. He has a secondary education. He has his own business \u2013 he raises livestock. He buys young calves, feeds them for 40 to 45 days and then sells them in the same market.  He has a shed where he keeps his calves. He has been in this business for 15 years. Raising livestock is a common business in rural areas. Currently, it is the season to buy calves and Faysilla wants to purchase additional calves, which will increase his turnover and bring additional income. Since he doesn\u2019t have enough money to purchase additional calves, he applied for a loan. He plans to repay his loan within 9 months. \r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Jamilya & Keith Leitich, Kiva Volunteers. <\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\u0425\u0430\u0441\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432

O. lives in the city of Yavan. She is 47 years old, married and has 6 children. She finished high school. Bibirikiya obtains a stable income from breeding and taking care of farm animals. She has a small farm business with goats and young cows. Bibirikiya would like to purchase one milk cow in order to produce fresh milk. During spring and summer it is easy to sustain large farm animals, because there is no problem feeding the animals. However, the client does not have the money. This is why she plans to receive a loan, which will help her reach the goal. Besides, she would be able to sell this milk, thereby receiving additional income for her family. The client has 6 children and she needs to raise her income. Bibirikiya plans to pay off the loan within 12 months. <p><b>Translated from Russian by Anna Startseva, Kiva volunteer<p>.<b>\r\n\u041e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0435\u0432\u0430

M. lives in the city of Yavan. The client is 45 years old. He is married and has 8 children. He finished high school. Hasan is a mechanic by training. But his main business and the source of income for the family is agriculture. Hasan has a plot of land where he plants wheat, linen and other seeds. After receiving crops, he leaves a part for his family and sells the other large part. Hasan has been in this business for 18 years. Now is time to plant, therefore the client needs additional resources to purchase wheat seeds, fertilizer and pay for tractor rent. This is why he would like to receive a loan. This will help Hasan purchase quality seeds and get a quality crop, which will help expand his client base and to sell all crops. He plans to repay the loan within 15 months. <p><b>Translated from Russian by Anna Startseva, Kiva volunteer<p>.<b>\r\n\u041c\u0443\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0432 \u0425\u0430\u0441\u0430\u043d

Minochovich S., 45, is a resident of Yavan district.  He is married and has six children.  He has a secondary school education and does not have a job.  His family's only source of income is their private livestock business in the village.  Kumriddin has a small cowshed, where he raises calves to sell.  He buys young animals at the Yavan markets, fattens them over 40-45 days, and then sells the fattened animals back at the same markets.  Now, the season for buying and selling animals has begun and Kumriddin needs to increase his turnover.  To do this, he needs extra money, so he has applied to MLF HUMO for a loan.  The additional money will not only help Kumriddin increase turnover; it will also give his family badly needed income and help them improve their lives.  Kumriddin plans to repay the loan over ten months.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Susie Armitage, Kiva Volunteer.<\/p><\/b>\r\n\r\n\u0421\u0430\u043c\u0430\u0434\u043e\u0432

N., 37, lives in the city of Yavan.  She is married, but she and her husband do not have any children.  Hafiza does not have a formal education.  She has a small business selling clothing at the \"Tichorat\" market, where she rents a trading stall.  Hafiza brings goods to Yavan from Dushanbe (her country's capital). She buys clothes from wholesalers there and offers the residents of Yavan the goods they demand.  This gives the local population the chance to go shopping without leaving Yavan.  Hafiza's trading stall also helps develop the business sector in her town.  <p>\r\n\r\nIn addition, Hafiza lives with her husband's parents and other relatives, and she must support this large family.  She would like to increase her earnings, and only additional financial support can help her achieve this goal.  Hafiza is applying for a loan to increase her stall's turnover.  She can repay her loan within 4 months.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Susie Armitage, Kiva Volunteer.<\/p><\/b>\r\n\r\n\u041d\u0438\u0435\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430

Dzhuraevna B., 41, lives in the city of Yavan.  She is married and has five children.  Since Kabiroy has finished only secondary school, she doesn't have a specialized education and does not work outside the home.  However, she is engaged in livestock breeding at home, which brings badly needed income to her family.  Kabiroy is applying for a loan to buy a cow, in order to increase the number of livestock she owns.  This will serve as an investment for her family.  Kabiroy can pay off the loan within 8 months, after which the cow will remain in her possession and bear calves.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Susie Armitage, Kiva

The family\u2019s economy improves. She is in the process of building their new house. With it they won\u2019t be worry much when weather turns bad. She is grateful for the goodness of the Fund. Next round she is applying for a loan of 575USD to buy more piglets. She also would buy bamboo to weave baskets to sell. The profit from selling baskets is used to make weekly payments.

She also has a lot of children so things are really difficult. Her first loan from TYM was 200 USD which was used to raise pigs. She had barely enough money to feed her children. After years of hard work and determination, her children had grown up. They have a job so they could contribute financially. With her savings, she had built a house worth 6000-7000 USD. Her dream has come true. When the loan officers came to visit her in her new house, she was very emotional when she talked about how TYM had helped her turn her life around. Her wish is to remain a TYM member forever, continuing her business.

Each year she earned a profit of some hundred dollars.  In 2003, Mrs. M. started to carve wood for manufacturers who produce chairs and tables.  She often get the orders and then buy wood to carve the specific design that the manufacturers wanted.  The job is not easy, yet it brings pretty high income to her family.

He hopes to make more profit and to save money for his wedding.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Olga Espira, Kiva volunteer. <\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\u041a\u0443\u0448\u0431\u043e\u0435\u0432 \u0410\u0431\u0434\u0443\u0440\u0430\u0443\u0444 \u043c\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0439 \u0447\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a \u0432 \u0432\u043e\u0437\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0435 22 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u043d\u0435 \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0442 \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043a\u0443\u043f\u043b\u0435\u0439 \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0436\u0435\u0439 \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0442\u0430.\u0421 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u043b\u0441\u044f \u0443\u0445\u043e\u0434\u043e\u043c \u0437\u0430 \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043c \u0441\u043e \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0438\u043c \u043e\u0442\u0446\u043e\u043c,\u043d\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435 \u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043a\u0430\u043a \u043e\u0442\u0435\u0446 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043b \u0443\u0435\u0437\u0436\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u043a\u0438 \u0432 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044e \u043e\u043d \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043b \u0441\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u044f\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u043c.\u0418 \u043f\u043e\u0447\u0443\u0432\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0432 \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0441 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0431\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0430 \u043e\u043d \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0430\u043b \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0442\u044c \u0434\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0434 ,\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441 \u0443\u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0438\u043b\u0441\u044f , \u043f\u043e\u044d\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u043e\u043d \u0440\u0435\u0448\u0438\u043b \u0432\u0437\u044f\u0432 \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u043a\u0443\u043f\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0435\u0449\u0435 \u043f\u0430\u0440\u0443 \u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432.\u041e\u043d \u0445\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0442 \u0437\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0434\u0435\u043d\u044c\u0433\u0438\u0441 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0431\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043f\u0438\u0432 \u0438\u0445 \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u044e \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0442\u044c\u0431\u0443."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":141432,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy more livestock -

is a 49-year-old mother of 6 children. Her husband is a school teacher. She has operated her bakery for nearly 30 years. She has 1 assistant, who helps her prepare her bread. The proceeds of the loan will go toward buying additional supplies and toward a new electric oven. Her traditional oven, pictured here, is made of clay and is deteriorating.  <p>\r\n\r\nOne of Mary's children has just finished secondary school with top marks and is planning on attending medical school. To achieve this dream, Mary hopes to be able to set aside more savings from her business to help with the significant expenses.  <p>\r\n\r\nMary is a member of the trust group Nyame Beye (God Will Do It). The trust group works on the principle that the peer pressure of the group creates a type of social collateral, where each member ensures that the other member repays her share of the loan.  <p>\r\n\r\nMary is pictured on the right placing some loaves into her oven.

A. lives in the Abdurahmon Jomi area.  He is 44 years old, married, with 5 children. He has no formal education. He is involved in raising and selling of cattle. He buys young bulls, feeds them for about 40-45 days to fatten them up and then sells them at a higher price to make a profit.  This business is the sole income earner for his family. He has been doing this for 21 years. This is a common business in his area and it is profitable. \r\n<p>Right now he has less capital on hand due to a cold winter. He was forced to sell a few of his bulls to stock up on feed for the rest of the animals. He now needs to replenish his inventory and hopes to do this by getting a loan.

Boinazarov lives in the Abdurahmon Jomi area. He is 44 years old, married and has 4 children. He has no formal education. He  is involved in livestock trade. He buys young bulls, feeds them  for about 40-45 days to fatten them up  and then sells them at a higher price to make a profit.  This business is the sole income earner for his family. He has been doing this for 2 years. This is a common business in his rural area and it is profitable. \r\n<p>Right now he has less capital on hand due to a cold winter. He was forced to sell a few of his bulls to stock up on feed for the rest of the animals. He now needs to replenish his inventory and hopes to do this by getting a loan. The loan will help to revive his business and income, which his family urgently needs.  In addition, his business will help the overall development of the livestock area.  He hopes to repay his loan in the course of 10 months.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Olga Espira, Kiva volunteer. <\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\u0411\u043e\u0439\u043d\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0432

Holmuradova lives in the town of Vahdat. She is 46 years old, married, and has 6 children. She has high school education and, currently, is not employed. The income earned by her husband is not sufficient to cover all of the family expenses. For this reason, she wants to purchase a cow, which will provide milk for the family. In case there is extra milk, she plans to sell it to her neighbors at low prices. This will help both her family and her neighbors. That is why she is asking for this loan.

G. lives in the village of Yavan. He is 25 years old and is not married. However, he is the sole provider for his large family headed by his parents. He doesn't have higher education, but he works as a cattle breeder. He purchases livestock, feeds it for 40 to 45 days, a later sells it at a higher price. As he sells the cattle, he immediately purchases new ones and continues the cycle. This type of business is widespread in villages like his. He makes good profit with this business, especially in Spring and Summer. He has been in this business for the last 8 years. Recently, Hurshed saw a decrease in the amount of money that is cycled in his business because of the winter weather. He is asking for a loan so he could increase his turnover and purchase addition livestock. This will help him restore his business and the usual income that is so needed for his family. He plans to pay off the loan within 10 months.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Russian by Vasilisa Budnikova, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\u0413\u0430\u0444\u0443\u0440\u043e\u0432
