Bulgan is 34 years old and lives with her son, mother, and younger sister in Bayanhongor Province, Mongolia. She and her family live in a traditional Mongolian nomadic housing tent called a \"ger.\" Her son is nine years old and attends a local secondary school. \r\n\r\nWith the help of her sister, Bulgan operates a clothing business from a rented stall at a local market in her town. Bulgan spends most of her time importing her clothing products from China. Her sister run the market stall. Bulgan started her business in 2008 after having operating a small cafe with her friends. She is very focused on building a successful business and is currently taking courses at the Mongolian Trading and Manufacturing College to increase her business knowledge. She has used this knowledge and her past experience to expand her business over the last year. \r\n\r\nBulgan has many plans for the future and hopes to rent a second stall soon where she will sell shoes. She is requesting a 2,000,000 tugrug (~ $1375 USD) loan to purchase clothing for her business and pay her school fees.\r\n\r\nAbout XacBank\r\nXacBank was founded in 2001, and listed its first loan on Kiva in January 2009.

Narantsatsralt is 31 years old and lives with her husband in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. They live in a ger, which is a traditional Mongolian nomadic housing tent. Narantsatsralt graduated in 2001 from a cooking course and now operates a small cafe in her town. She opened for business in 2008 and has used her knowledge and experience to quickly grow her business. She attributes her quick success to her cafe's good location. Her cafe is located near a school and the many students provide her with constant business. Narantsatsralt is working hard to improve her cafe and already has plans to expand in the near future. She says, \"I hope to grow my cafe into a nice, full-service restaurant.\" She is requesting a 1,000,000-tugrug loan to purchase a new refrigerator for her cafe.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout XacBank\r\nXacBank was founded in 2001, and listed its first loan on Kiva in January 2009.

It is currently utilizing Kiva\u2019s 0% lending interest rate to return 9% of interest paid from borrowers to them in the form of a savings account at the end of their loans.

C. is 48 years old and lives with her husband and four children in Zavkhan Province, Mongolia. She and her family live in a ger, which is a traditional Mongolian nomadic housing tent. Her husband currently works as a loader at a local meat factory. With the help of her children, Sodnomtseren operates a small bakery in her town, making a variety of breads and buns that are very popular among her many customers. She produces on average up to 20-25 loaves of bread and 8-10 kg of buns per day. <p>\r\n\r\nSodnomtseren started her bakery business in 2004. At first she had only a manual oven to make her products, but after several years of steady earnings she was able to purchase a more efficient modern oven last year. Her success has also enabled her to buy new furniture for her home and pay her children's tuition fees. Sodnomtseren is working hard to continue her success in the future. She hopes to soon purchase more tools and supplies to help her business and says, \"My goal is to one day own my own workplace.\"  She is requesting a 500,000 tugrug (~350 USD) loan to purchase flour for her bakery.\r\n\r\nAbout XacBank\r\nXacBank was founded in 2001, and listed its first loan on Kiva in January 2009.

Their sales are cash- or credit-based, and their customers are both men and women. \r\nThe women envisage making an average monthly profit of 37.500 FCFA each; part of this will be used for savings and family needs, and the rest reinvested in business activities. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Danielle Treharne, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2325,"image":{"id":440538,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy various goods.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-12-05T15:10:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Awa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alimata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Korotoumou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dj\u00e9n\u00e9bou Yacouba ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fanta  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dj\u00e9n\u00e9bou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bintou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":1000000,"loan_amount":2325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":387.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":387.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":387.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":387.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":387.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":387.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":387.5,"local_amount":166666.67,"processed_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T17:05:38Z","rounded_local_amount":168398.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110763604,"comment":null},{"amount":387.5,"local_amount":166666.67,"processed_date":"2010-01-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-19T09:11:16Z","rounded_local_amount":168398.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118152438,"comment":null},{"amount":387.5,"local_amount":166666.67,"processed_date":"2010-02-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-18T08:48:54Z","rounded_local_amount":168398.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123991280,"comment":null},{"amount":387.5,"local_amount":166666.67,"processed_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-17T08:14:26Z","rounded_local_amount":168398.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129021550,"comment":null},{"amount":387.5,"local_amount":166666.67,"processed_date":"2010-04-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:15:21Z","rounded_local_amount":168398.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136746346,"comment":null},{"amount":387.5,"local_amount":166666.65,"processed_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:28Z","rounded_local_amount":168398.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144778891,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-12-05T18:06:30Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":158979,"name":"Nelly Atieno","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nelly Atieno O., 31, is married and has four children ranging from the age of 4 to 13.

Mrs. Yenny used to work as a housekeeper and it was there that she first saw that the woman she worked for brought clothes, sheets, quilts and other products from Oruro as her business. This sparked her interest in the business and, with the help of her employer, she began to drive her on the trips to distribute the products in the markets in Santa Cruz. Three years ago she became independent and brings all the before-mentioned products to her home, which she inherited, where she has a small building she and her husband worked to put up.  Six months ago her youngest child was born and, because of this, she stopped traveling and her resources have begun to decrease. The loan she would like to receive from this organization would be of much help to allow her to start traveling and begin to increase profits once again.  Lately she is buying very little merchandise, but here in Santa Cruz she could distribute it all at once to the businesses with encouraging profits.  Her dream is to be able to bring a lot of merchandise like her former employer did and, in this way, finish the construction of her home and buy her own vehicle.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

He lives with his father in the Cayalti district, about one hour from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nFor the last twenty years he has worked servicing and maintaining electrical products.  He learned the trade through experience, and little by little, thanks to his savings, has been able to open up a business near the market and this is where he serves his customers.  This business is the only income source for his family.\r\n\r\nHe tells us that he also buys used household products, and repairs them so they can be resold to people who don\u2019t have the money to purchase new ones.\r\n\r\nThe little capital that he has to buy the replacement parts isn\u2019t enough and he has to continually travel to Chiclayo to purchase them.  That is why he is asking for a loan of 1000 new sols ($350.00) for the first time from Edpyme Alternativa.\r\n\r\nHis greatest dream is to build a house out of good materials so that he can offer his family a better quality of life.  He is very hard-working and is happy with his trade.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Miriam Palacio, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":440626,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Electronics Repair","sector":"Services","use":"To buy replacement parts to repair electrical products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Cayalt\u00ed - Chiclayo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2009-12-05T23:00:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Segundo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":67.7},{"due_date":"2010-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":73.07},{"due_date":"2010-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":73.48},{"due_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":78.49},{"due_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":78.55},{"due_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":81.85},{"due_date":"2010-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":82.71},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":88.16},{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":89.6},{"due_date":"2010-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":92.27},{"due_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":96.09},{"due_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":98.03}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.7},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.57},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.72},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.47},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.49},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.65},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.95},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.85},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.36},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.3},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.63},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.31}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":23.7,"local_amount":67.7,"processed_date":"2009-12-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T12:48:12Z","rounded_local_amount":68.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110669684,"comment":null},{"amount":25.57,"local_amount":73.07,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:16:11Z","rounded_local_amount":73.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118065185,"comment":null},{"amount":25.72,"local_amount":73.48,"processed_date":"2010-02-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:47:07Z","rounded_local_amount":74.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123900287,"comment":null},{"amount":27.47,"local_amount":78.49,"processed_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:45:24Z","rounded_local_amount":79.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128934438,"comment":null},{"amount":27.49,"local_amount":78.55,"processed_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:08:47Z","rounded_local_amount":79.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136662054,"comment":null},{"amount":28.65,"local_amount":81.85,"processed_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:06:55Z","rounded_local_amount":82.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144694761,"comment":null},{"amount":28.95,"local_amount":82.71,"processed_date":"2010-06-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:38:08Z","rounded_local_amount":83.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151877816,"comment":null},{"amount":30.85,"local_amount":88.16,"processed_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:50:24Z","rounded_local_amount":88.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159617863,"comment":null},{"amount":31.36,"local_amount":89.6,"processed_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:01:29Z","rounded_local_amount":90.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166832272,"comment":null},{"amount":32.3,"local_amount":92.27,"processed_date":"2010-09-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:56:24Z","rounded_local_amount":93.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172098896,"comment":null},{"amount":67.94,"local_amount":194.12,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-16T10:43:43Z","rounded_local_amount":195.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177554358,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-12-06T09:13:09Z","paid_date":"2010-11-16T10:43:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":159029,"name":"Rosa Luisa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Sra.

He buys them in adjacent settlements, fattens them up, sells them to brokers who frequent the area.  He also works in construction.  These activities are his only sources of income with which he supports his household.  He tells us that he acquired two cows recently that he is raising for future sale.

Dora lives in her own house. She  sells food retail which she buys wholesale, and delivers in the area to customers who pay on credit in two payments.                   She also purchases seasonal products: she is currently buying Christmas items.  The competition is normal, but she has acquired a lot of experience and developed her abilities and skills in the business.  This has helped her a lot and now she is very popular with her customers.  With the loan that she received from the institution, Dora is putting capital into the business since the season is short- being close to the end of the year.  And she is paying a balance to agrocapital.  Dora\u2019s history of payments is good and her average of late days is zero.

Reina es clienta antigua en nuestra instituci\u00f3n con dos operaciones canceladas anteriormente de manera puntual.","en":"Reina's family consists of 4 people. Reina is 42 years old, her daughter is 16, and the two boys are 12 and 4. She is currently single. Her home is a crudely-built room with basic amenities. Reina prepares and bakes bread. She also sells snacks because she lives close to the local design school. \r\n\r\nReina is the only client that makes bread and she doesn't have much competition. At the same time, the demand is high and she sells everything she produces. The loan will be used for construction on her home; she is building an additional room and has all the materials necessary, as shown in the photograph. \r\n\r\nReina is one our institution's oldest clients, with two previous loans that were repaid punctually.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Vivian Lu, Kiva

For this reason, he is requesting his first loan from Edpyme Alternativa in the amount of 500 soles to buy pigs for fattening and selling.\r\n<p>\r\nRobert is a devoted father who wants to give his family everything they need to get ahead.

Rezel, who is married and has one school-aged child, owns and operates a general store whose income derives primarily from selling daily-use products such as shampoo, soap and toothpaste in the local community. Rezel has been engaged in her business for over fours years and earns approximately 2000 PHP a month.<p>\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Rezel joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.

S. is from the village of Gud, San Isidro. She is 51 years old and married with three adult children. To make a living, Amelita owns and operates a general store. She sells a variety of different products in the local community. Amelita earns approximately $87 a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Amelita joined the Kiva field partner, ASKI, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation by engaging in business activities. Amelita is requesting a loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be her 1st loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful micro-finance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

A. is from the village of Gud, San Isidro. He is 23 years old. Ryan is single. To make a living, Ryan owns & operates a business venture in the services sector operating a service-based business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from motorcycle transport. Ryan has been engaged in his business for almost a year and earns approximately 300 PHP a day for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Ryan joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Ryan is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to repair a transport vehicle used in the business. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Ryan from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the borrower's business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Mirasol has been engaged in her business for over 4 years and earns approximately 600 PHP a day for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Mirasol joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Mirasol is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP which will be used to purchase materials needed to provide service. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Mirasol from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of the borrower's family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She works with her husband in the same place - cafe Etis. He works as an electrician and she is a cook. They have raised one son who is twenty one right now. At this time he is studying in university. Using his free time he works as a miscellaneous worker in a private construction company in the city of Bishkek. In today's time one profession or job is not enough and Raisa also decided to walk in foot with time. She has managed to find a good use for her cooking skills. And in a way so that it benefits her financially. She has partnered with some stores and cafes so that she will supply them with her own made \"pelmeni\" (dumplings with filling). Besides that she was also able to find clients to purchase noodles for lagman (a dish consisting of long noodles, meat and vegetables), which Raisa will also make herself. For Raisa this extra business has turned out to be a really good thing. Because she does not need to go anywhere. She completes all her orders from home and this is why this job does not wear her out. Besides that Raisa had a few debts. The salary of a cook in cafe alone was not enough to pay off her debts all at once. But after she has started her own business it did not take very much for her to pay off all of her debts. Only a few hours of work during the weekends brings Raisa around 3,000 soms monthly. Many people have to work a whole month for this money. Right now Raisa decided to ask for a loan to buy two bags of flour, meat for the filling and use the remainder of the loan to pay her son's tuition. \r\n\r\nRaisa has four partners in her group:\r\n\r\nNasykat is twenty years old. She works as a bartender in a cafe. Nasykat is not married and lives with parents. She needs a loan to pay her tuition contract.\r\n\r\nZhyldyz is 25 years old. Zhyldyz is not married and works as a waitress in a cafe. At home she and her brother feed and sell cattle. Zhyldyz needs a loan to buy two calves.\r\n\r\nOlga is 52 years old. Olga works as a dishwasher in a cafe and has also recently opened a small grocery store. Olga wants to get a loan and buy two tons of coal and merchandise for the store.\r\n \r\nTurat is 21 years old. He is studying in a polytechnic university and also works as an operator at a gas station. Turat hopes to get a loan to pay his tuition fees.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Elena Fedorchuk, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1275,"image":{"id":441053,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"To buy flour and meat for dumplings and noodles, and to pay for son's education","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kant","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":135,"posted_date":"2009-12-05T23:10:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Raisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nasykat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jyldyz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Olga","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Turat","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":55000,"loan_amount":1275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":10101},{"due_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":10419},{"due_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":10978},{"due_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":11493},{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":12009}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":234.16},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":241.53},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":254.49},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":266.43},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":278.39}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":234.16,"local_amount":10101,"processed_date":"2009-12-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:16:49Z","rounded_local_amount":10267.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110730800,"comment":null},{"amount":241.53,"local_amount":10419,"processed_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:08:44Z","rounded_local_amount":10591.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118121347,"comment":null},{"amount":254.49,"local_amount":10978,"processed_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:46:53Z","rounded_local_amount":11159.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123956999,"comment":null},{"amount":266.43,"local_amount":11493,"processed_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-21T07:41:48Z","rounded_local_amount":11682.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128989808,"comment":null},{"amount":278.39,"local_amount":12009,"processed_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:35:50Z","rounded_local_amount":12207.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136715617,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-12-07T20:46:22Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T11:35:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":159172,"name":"Soklin","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Soklin L., 41, and her husband Mr. Teat Ly, 42, have been married since 1991.

She has lived a simple life, raising three children. After the children grew up and left to work she still engaged herself in doing her everyday work around the house. She keeps some cattle and manages to earn a certain amount of money by selling milk. \r\n<p>\r\nThe children have begun to make their own living. The eldest and the middle brothers are married and live separately. The youngest son, now 21, is also married. But according to Central Asian tradition, the youngest son stays with his parents to take care of them once they get old.\r\n<p>\r\nLife in the rural area has been more attractive to Zyinatkan than the life in a bustling city. The fresh air and everyday work of raising cattle have kept Zyinatkan young. She loves the way she lives and enjoys every day of her life. Now that her son is by her side and helps look after the cattle, her life is even easier. \r\n<p>\r\nSelling milk brings Zyinatkan about $70 a month. Because of this money, Zyinatkan has been able to make some repairs at home. One thing that concerns Zyinatkan is the winter season. They need coal to get through it. Zyinatkan has applied for this loan to purchase a sufficient amount of coal. \r\n\r\nZyinatkan\u2019s partners are: \r\n\r\nAinur, 45, keeps cattle and sells milk. Her husband helps Ainur around the house. They have five children: four daughters and one son. Two daughters live separately. Ainur needs a loan to prepare a dowry for their third daughter. \r\n\r\nFarida, 44, and her husband are raising four children. They keep cattle and farm. They make their living by selling milk and onions that they grew. Farida needs a loan to make a repair at her house. Her goal is to give all her children a good education.\r\n\r\nMirbek, 21, is single. He is already making his own living. He has a trailer and offers transportation services. Besides that, he raises livestock and sells milk. Mirbek needs a loan to buy fuel for sowing.\r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of the 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n<p>\r\nAgnes is married and has one school-aged child. To make a living, Agnes owns and operates a business selling seafood products, including fish and shrimp, in the local community. Agnes has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately $43 a month from this activity.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2007, Agnes joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation by engaging in business activities. Agnes is requesting a loan of 15,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be her 1st loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful micro-finance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

is a single 35-year-old entrepreneur trying to earn income to help her family with their daily needs and to save for her future. She lives in the village of Brgy Alejandria, La Carlota City, Negros Occidental. \r\n<p>\r\nRosavic joined the Kiva field partner, NWTF-Project Dungganon, in October 2003 in order to open her own business.  Upon receiving her first loan, she started a fish-vending and ready-to-wear (RTW) business so she could help her parents. Unfortunately, her fish-vending business lasted for for only two years. \r\n<p>\r\nWhen she received her 6th cycle loan, she invested in a pig-fattening business and added it to her RTW business. With succeeding loans, her businesses got bigger and earned good money.  She also invested in frozen products for additional income. She is able to earn about $152 a month at a minimum. She saves most of her income for the future and for her family.\r\n<p>\r\nWith the utilization of her previous loan of 7,000 PHP to buy frozen products, Rosavic was able pay in full and on time without any delay, giving her recognition as a good performing member by maintaining her good credit record to the center and to NWTF-PD.  At present, she is borrowing 15,000 PHP, which will be used as additional working capital for her pig-fattening business.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n<p>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the  lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is  empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a  life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon -  a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of the community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

in native products made from rattan like baskets or \u201cbukag\u201d, \u201coway\u201d, hand fans, rattan balls for \"sipak takraw\", native brooms and \"abacca\" rope is a tough business for a widow with four children like Mrs. Vitaliana A.. She is 50 years of age, living in Barangay III, Tangub City. She has a daughter who works in Jordan and helps her with her financial problems.  The rest of her children are school-age. <P>\r\n\r\nVitaliana has been running this kind of business for 2 years, beginning with a starting capital of P1,500.

From the average of two units being assembled and sold, they are earning an average net income of P6,000 a month. With eight units of videoke machine and several video game machines operating in the city, they are also receiving an average share from all these units of not less than P5,000 every 15th and 30th day of the month.\r\n\r\nJust this year, Yolanda joined Paglaum MPC because she is interested in our programs and services. With a good character and with capacity, she was given the privilege of obtaining a loan of P50,000 with the purpose of purchasing additional parts and accessories to assemble new video game units and to recondition all other old units for sale.\r\n\r\nThe future profits from this loan will be used to save for their children\u2019s future and for their daily needs.

Her husband has operated their watch-repair business for the past 29 years in the city proper of La Carlota. The couple is blessed with five children, ages 5 to 16 years old. \r\n \r\nMa. Fe started from nothing. They live in a very dilapidated house because her husband's income cannot support the total needs of the family. She worried about the future and what would happen if her children started going to school. Thus, she invested in a pig-fattening business that can also help in defraying family expenses. She continued her business until such time that she could expand it.  \r\n\r\nIn 2004, she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon for the said purpose of expanding the businesses, especially the pig-fattening business. She was able to improve her business by buying additional pigs for fattening. With one sow to raise, she has used some of her loan as additional capital for her watch-repair business. She was able to earn a minimum of 3,600 Philippine pesos per month. She saves most of her income for the education of her children. Ma. Fe joined NWTF-Project Dungganon so she could have her  own business and to help her husband for her children's future because she wants all of them to finish their studies and get good jobs.\r\n\r\nMa. Fe's previous loan of Php 15,000 was utilized for the pig-fattening business and was fully paid on time and in full without delay.

Estrella is requesting a loan of 30,000 PHP, which will be used for additional working capital in her business. This will be her 7th loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful micro-finance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

is a 29-year-old mother with two young children, ages 4 and 7.  She works hard to help her husband meet the needs of their children, especially their education, and to improve their family's living conditions. Dolores lives in the village of Brgy Paraiso, Sagay City, Negros Occidental.  Her husband, Walter, works as a laborer in a Hacienda (sugarcane plantation).  The money he earns is not enough to sustain the needs of their family, especially their children. \r\n<p>\r\nBecause Dolores has knowledge about running a business, she would think of ways to begin and what kind of business she could invest in.  This also encouraged her to join NWTF-Project Dungganon in the year 2002 in order to have start-up capital for her proposed business.\r\n<p>\r\nWith the capital to invest in a general store, she bought different items to sell.  Loans continued, and she was able to add a food-vending business and a pig-fattening business.  She knows that this can help her earn money and realize her dreams. She was able to earn a minimum of $43 a month and saved most of it for her children.\r\n<p>\r\nHer previous loan of 17,000 PHP was used as working capital for her business. That amount was returned to NWTF-PD in full and on-time without any delay. She is currently on her 13th cycle loan, requesting 19,000 PHP, which will be used to buy additional items to sell in her general store.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n<p>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of the community who has earned respect through  a lifetime of hard and honest

She is 32 years old. Eva is the group leader of a 4-member group requesting a loan through ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\nEva is married and has 2 school-aged children. To make a living, Eva owns and operates a general store. The main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap and toothpaste in the local community. Eva has been engaged in her business for over 4 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month from it.\r\nEva joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Eva is requesting a new loan of 6000 PHP which will be used to purchase vegetables to sell. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Eva from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the central and northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

E. lives in the village of Prk Tan-ao, Brgy Lopez Jaena, Sagay City, Negros Occidental. She is 60 years old.  She works and earns for the day-to-day living costs of her family. She is married and blessed with four adult children aged from 30 to 37 years old. Luz wants to secure her future when she is older and still be able to help her grandchildren finish their studies.\r\n<p>Years ago, Luz wanted to earn extra money to help her husband and to send the children to school. Because she lived in a hacienda, a sugarcane plantation, she thought that a general store would be a very convenient business to put up in their area - different items sold at an affordable price and the fastest turnover of capital and income. She invested in a small store to reach her goal of helping her husband. The income from her business was allocated for education, family expenses and additional capital. Business ran smoothly and she was able to expand it. \r\nIn 1995 she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon to expand her business and to buy additional products to sell. With more capital, her loans had a big impact on her business because she was able to earn more compared to her previous earnings.  Her general store supplies the needs of the hacienda employees which is payable at the end of each week. She earns a minimum of Php 4,000 a month. She saves most of her income for her future and for her grandchildren.\r\n<p>Luz's previous loan of Php 19,000 was used as additional capital for her general store. The said amount was paid every week and fully paid within her loan term without any delay. Her 18th cycle loan of the same amount of Php 19,000 will be used as additional working capital. Income from it will be used for her grandchildren's education.\r\n<p>About NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the  lives of thousands of women through Project  &lt;i&gt;Dungganon&lt;\/i&gt; (a Hiligaynon word that means  &lt;u&gt;Honorable&lt;\/u&gt;). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is  empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them &lt;i&gt;Dungganon&lt;\/i&gt; -  a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":439368,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

picture above shows Mr. Rit P., who is a man on low income living in Phnom Penh City. He owns a big area of farmland next to his house, on which he and his wife grow a variety of vegetable crops. Rit P. always plants his crops twice a year and can collect his mature crops three times per year. \r\n<p>For this coming harvesting rice season, rice is commanding the lowest price.

She is 39 years old. Perla is married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Perla owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for sale. Perla earns approximately 4,000 whenever she sells her raised animals.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Perla joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Perla is requesting a new loan of 11,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in future. This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Perla from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Dorjhand is 64 years old and lives with her husband in Arkhangai province in central Mongolia. She lives in a ger, which is a traditional Mongolian nomadic housing tent. Dorjihand operates a door-to-door meal service in her town. She prepares a variety of different meals at her home and delivers them directly to her customers. She has a loyal customer base consisting mainly of people working at various local businesses. They appreciate her convenient service. \r\n\r\nDorjhand started her business in 2000 with capital of 20,000 tugrugs (~14 USD). She has been very successful over the years and works hard to attract new customers. Today, her working capital exceeds 400,000 tugrugs (~280 USD).

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nLoida is married and has 2 school-aged children. To make a living, Loida owns & operates a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap & toothpaste in the local community. Loida has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Loida joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Loida is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Loida from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of the borrower's children. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Galbaatar is 49 years old, and lives with his wife and two children in Gobi-Altai province, Mongolia.  He and his family live in a traditional Mongolian housing tent, which is called a \"ger.\"  Both of his children (a son and a daughter) attend university.  <p>\r\n\r\nTo earn a living, Galbaatar, with his wife's help, operates a firewood and coal-trading business in his town.  They use their own truck to transport the coal and firewood, and they rent a small stall from which they sell their products.  Galbaatar started his business in 2004 with a loan of 500,000 MNT (~$350) from Xacbank, Kiva's Mongolian MFI partner.  Over the years, his business has been quite successful, and he has proven himself to be a trustworthy borrower.  Galbaatar is focused on the future; in particular, he hopes to generate additional income so that he can pay for his children's tuition.  He is now requesting a loan in the amount of 4,000,000 MNT (~$2,750) to purchase another truck to use for his business. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout XacBank: XacBank was founded in 2001, and listed its first Kiva loan in January 2009.  It is the largest micro-finance organization in Mongolia, but also has mainstream commercial operations.  XacBank has the vision, scale, and innovation to develop and implement new solutions to poverty.  It is currently utilizing Kiva\u2019s 0% lending interest rate to return 9% of interest paid from borrowers in the form of a savings account upon the maturity of their loans.  By doing so, XacBank not only allows borrowers to gain financially, but also encourages them to save.

S. is from the city of Capatan Tuguegarao, City. He is 43 years old. Alford is married and has four school-aged children. To make a living, Alford operates a service-based business. The main source of income for the business comes from providing repair services to local community members. Alford has been engaged in his business for over 10 years and earns approximately 5,000 Philippine pesos a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Alford joined ASKI, a Kiva partner, to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Alford is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase materials needed to provide service. This will be the first loan taken out by Alford from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of his children. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful micro-finance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

sells slightly used handbags at the front of her house in Warri, Delta state, Nigeria. She is happy because she does not have to pay stall rent. The demands for her slightly used handbags are high because there are people in her community who cannot afford new bags. She is married with three children and she is 32 years old. She is a LAPO client.

Jambaa is 24 years old and lives with her parents in Uvurkhangai province in central Mongolia. She and her family live in a traditional Mongolian nomadic housing tent called a \"ger\".

She provides some services on-site but mainly takes orders from local residents and businesses and sends them to a company in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia, to be completed. Jambaa started her business in 2009 by renting a stall at a local trading center to conduct her business. Although she doesn't have all of the equipment necessary to print large signs and bannars, her business has grown quickly since she opened earlier this year. She says, \"I am planning to expand and improve my business and want to have my own working place in the future so that I can complete all of my services on site.\" She is requesting a 4,000,000 tugrug (~2800 USD) loan to purchase printing supplies and equipment for her business.\r\n\r\nAbout XacBank\r\nXacBank was founded in 2001, and listed its first loan on Kiva in January 2009.

Vilma has been engaged in her business for over 15 years and earns approximately 9,000 PHP a month.<p>\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Vilma joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Vilma is requesting a new loan, her third, of 7000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell.
