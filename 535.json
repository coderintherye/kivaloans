It has five female members who all know each other and are neighbors.  The members are as follows: Guadalupe \u00c1vila M., who will use her loan to buy organic fertilizer to fertilize her 'nopal' (prickly pear) crop; Leticia L. C., who will buy organic fertilizer to fertilize her prickly pear crop and improve her production; Marquelia R. D\u00edaz, who will buy men's and women's perfume, cosmetics and cosmetic kits in order to stock her business; Herminia R. M., who will buy fruit such as custard apples, loquats and avocados, to stock her business, and Guadalupe R. \u00c1vila, who will buy prickly pear stalks and fertilizer in bulk, in order to start her own production.\r\n\r\nGuadalupe \u00c1vila M. is the group's representative.  She is 56 years old and studied up to the fifth year of elementary school.  She is married and has five children: 1 daughter and 4 sons.  Her sons are agricultural workers.  Guadalupe's husband sells firewood.  He goes out to the countryside and gathers firewood to sell.  Guadalupe herself has a plot of land where she grows prickly pears.  She has requested this loan to buy manure for her prickly pear crop so that she can produce more.  She started this business 5 years ago.  Previously, she used to grow corn and beans.  She provided her children with some land and they also grow prickly pear cacti.\r\n\r\nGuadalupe learned her business as a young child.  Her father always used to grow prickly pear cacti and she and her siblings worked with him, weeding, removing the stalks and chopping.  They would cover the chopped prickly pear with soil so that it served as fertilizer and they would remove the fleshy pads.  These days, they hire a rototiller that chops the plants and removes weeds but it is expensive to hire.\r\n\r\nGuadalupe bought the plot of land where she grows her prickly pear crop and her dad left her the house where she is currently living.  Her plot of land is in the countryside.  She either walks there or takes a taxi which leaves her on the edge of the road and she then walks to her plot of land.  Her business is important and special to her because in good seasons, if they pay her well for her produce, she enjoys working on her crop.  She feels proud when she receives good money for it.  Guadalupe's customers are those who arrive first in their trucks to buy her produce.  Those who arrive first and pay the most take the produce.  She cuts her prickly pear to sell every week or two weeks.\r\n\r\nThe challenge that Guadalupe faces in her business is that during periods of cold weather, the cacti do not grow.  Her business is very well known because people eat prickly pear every day with their meals and it also has healing effects.  Guadalupe faces competition from other people who produce prickly pear but everyone is free to sell their product wherever they most like.  Guadalupe re-invests some of the profits that she makes back into her business, investing in buying fertilizer for her next sowing season and she also buys food.  Her children help her in the business.  Her daughter and husband cut the cacti and her husband also carries the boxes of produce.\r\n\r\nTlalnepantla is a very pretty village.  The countryside is very green and covered with prickly pear cacti.  You can also see the nearby volcano.  The climate is cold and temperate.  Guadalupe's business has helped her family financially.  When they don't have any money they go and cut some prickly pear to sell and then have enough to cover their food expenses or anything else they might need at home.  Guadalupe would like to repair her home, laying floor tiles and painting it so that it looks nicer.  Her plans and dreams are to enjoy a better life and to have money so that she can do more things.  She would like to have another bedroom for her daughter's children as her daughter is a single mother and has two children.  The improvements that Guadalupe would like to make for her children's future is to ensure that they have somewhere to live and for them to be content.

With a Kiva loan, BPW's borrowers are able to keep their store shelves stocked while increasing their profit margins by buying in greater volume. \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.  Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering micro-credit and business training programs to low-income women.

In the future, Shanta plans to boost the economic condition of her family and she thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\nIn the Kathmandu Valley, small grocery stores, called pasals, are an important part of the local economy.  Fresh produce, milk, and staples such as rice, lentils, and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home.  Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margains.  By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase their profitability.  While a typical pasal might be no more than 100 square feet, they are always full of bargaining customers, incoming produce, and shrewd businesswomen.\r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner microfinance institution, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.  Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women.  In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.

is 57-year-old Ruku K..  She is married and has 2 children aged 34 and 30.  In 1998, she established her grocery store business.  Working 7 days a week and 9 hours a day, she supports her family.\r\n\r\nShe has already received and successfully repaid one loan from Patan BPW and used her most recent loan to buys grocery goods for her shop. In the future, Ruku plans to improve the economic condition of her family and she thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\nIn the Kathmandu Valley, small grocery stores, called pasals, are an important part of the local economy.  Fresh produce, milk, and staples such as rice, lentils, and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home.  Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margins.  By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability.  While a typical pasal might be no more than 100 square feet, they are always full of bargaining customers, incoming produce, and shrewd businesswomen.\r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner microfinance institution, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.  Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women.  In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.  For more information about Patan BPW, visit our partner page and keep an eye out for new loans and borrower updates, or join our BPW Lending Team.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":700071,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"to buys

Isabel\u2019s family resides in Ascoville, Malaria, Caloocan City.\r\n\r\nIsabel currently runs a sari-sari (variety) store that caters to needs that are more immediate than the nearest grocery in the community. Isabel has operated her variety store from home for years now, along with her food vending business. With the help of her husband as cook, they cook and sell viand, delicacies to accompany rice, which are usually present in Filipino homes every meal time. \r\n\r\nServing their community with these businesses, they gained regular customers who keep her businesses alive. She employs no one and earns an estimated income of PHP 6,000 a month.\r\n\r\nTo help Isabel continue operation of her businesses, she is requesting a PHP 12,000 loan. She will use this to buy additional stock for her store and more raw ingredients like meats, vegetables and sacks of rice for her food vending business. She will see to it that her store will not lack any valuable thing that her customers need, so that they will make her their number one sari-sari store in the community.\r\n\r\nIsabel has learned the value of improving one\u2019s business, and thus works to innovate hers. She does not emphasize any problem she encounters but rather focuses on its solution. Goals cannot be met just by identifying the problem, but by acting on them. The most important goal she has in mind is to support her children until their college graduation, with which she will feel most fulfilled.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":700073,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase additional products for her variety store and raw ingredients needed for her food vending business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Caloocan City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-01-25T14:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-01-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":12000,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2011-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2011-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2011-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2011-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2011-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2011-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2011-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2011-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2011-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2011-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2011-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.34},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.34},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.34},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.34},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.34},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":18.33,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:28:56Z","rounded_local_amount":813.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191396093,"comment":null},{"amount":73.34,"local_amount":3200,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:29:18Z","rounded_local_amount":3254.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195814202,"comment":null},{"amount":91.66,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:37:58Z","rounded_local_amount":4068.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201256767,"comment":null},{"amount":73.34,"local_amount":3200,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:34:01Z","rounded_local_amount":3254.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206123460,"comment":null},{"amount":18.33,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:49:34Z","rounded_local_amount":813.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211194714,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-01-25T15:13:22Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T10:49:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":268121,"name":"Elsita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elsita P. is from the village of San Miguel, Gingoog City.

In the future, Sarswati plans to uplift the economic condition of her family. She thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\nOver 70% of Nepal's economy is agricultural. Typically, Nepali households grow crops on small plots of terraced land. Rice (bhat), lentils (daal) and vegetables (thakari) are the staples of the Nepali diet. With a Kiva loan, BPW's borrowers are able to purchase greater amounts of seed and fertilizer.  With more seeds and fertilizer, a borrower is able to grow cash crops to be sold in the local market. Such crops allow households to move beyond subsistence and provide much-needed cash income throughout the year. \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.  Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women. In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.

do not need to make a lot of mistakes before we get to learn. At the age of 54, Evelyn learns the ways of both business and life to get going at a better pace. She finished her high school education but her training in CCT* as a Community Partner enables her to run a business with confidence. She is married to Rodolfo T., a foreman. They live in Malaria, Caloocan City along with their two children, who are in high school.\r\n\r\nEvelyn has been in the direct selling business for three years and is still doing her best to master her trade. She tries to figure out what her customers like when it comes to bags, shoes, shirts and pants. With no employees to help her sell, Evelyn gives her utmost strength to make her business work. She earns an estimated income of 8,000 PHP per month.\r\n\r\nTo help her grow her business, Evelyn is requesting a loan of 8,000 PHP. She will use the loan to buy quality apparel to make sure that her customers get only the best in the market, as well as purchase those items ordered in advance by her customers. With this money on hand, she can easily improve her business, one lesson she learned in her fellowship* with fellow community partners.\r\n\r\nJust like any micro entrepreneur, Evelyn also suffers from customers who do not pay their debts. Still, as she learns how to be a successful entrepreneur, she also learns how to deal with such difficult times in business.

Lida B., 48, dreams for the best, but more than that, she acts to make it a reality. Lida is married to Jimmy B., a factory worker. They have three children who are now in elementary, high school, and college. Together, they live in Malaria, Caloocan City. \r\n\r\nLida has taken vocational courses. With the learning she gains as a Community Partner in CCT*, Lida runs her own sari-sari (variety) store to capitalize on the big target market she has in her community. She has been doing business here for seven years. It is quite easy for her since it is a residential business, and there is not much need at present to hire employees. She earns an estimated net income of 500 PHP per day.\r\n\r\nTo help grow her store, Lida is requesting a 22,000 PHP loan. She plans to use the funds to buy more grocery items to put in her store, so that it won\u2019t look bare and incomplete. Lida makes an effort to maintain her business in good shape, because a profitable business translates to family needs being met and the schooling of her children being supported. \r\n\r\nLida struggles with time management when it comes to balancing business, health and family life. However, she sees to it that these struggles will not prevent her from reaching her dreams for her family. She desires to see her small store grow and eventually expand. She dreams of having good health for everyone in the family and being able to send her children all the way through college. Deep inside, she knows that if there is faith, and action, everything will be possible.\r\n\r\nWith her going to CCT fellowship* meeting every week, she was able to improve and enjoy her relationship with God. As a Christian, through the Word of God, she also gained strength and inspiration day after day.\r\n\t\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":700089,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Her business has grown quickly over the years and she has gained much experience as a businesswoman. Her earnings have enabled her to build a winter house and buy a truck, so that her husband and youngest son could operate their transportation business. Thanks to their business and endless effort, three of her four children have attended University and gotten their degrees. Now they are all married and able to take care of their families by themselves.

The members of this family are all hardworking, honest and effective people who could use the bank loans successfully and improved their quality of life and pay the loan back on time. Handsuren is requesting a 2,000,000 MNT to purchase more meat that she could sell and make more money during Tsagaan Sar, Mongolian Traditional New Year.

Therefore, Tuya is requesting a 3,000,000 MNT loan to expand her business and increase the inventory of the grocery to sell during the Tsagaan Sar, Lunar year celebration of Mongolians. She says \"Once I have my own stall, there're not much difficulties in running such business. More goods will bring more income\".

Some cope with it thanks to the support of close ones, some with the help of personal beliefs, and some by using their faith. \r\n\r\nSonya B., 54, is a leader of this group. She is one of those people who, in spite of harsh conditions, push forward and look for a bright spot in a seemingly dark future. Sonya and her husband, a construction worker, step by step built their own home and gave birth to four sons and a daughter. Unfortunately, the oldest boy was born with innate physical disabilities, and needs special care and treatment and constant attention. But Sonya was not discouraged by the illness of her son, and she started looking for ways of assisting her husband financially. She chose private entrepreneurship, because it\u2019s the most profitable option for her.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Sonya saved some money to purchase a couple of heads of cattle. She had to remember her skills from her youth. Year by year Sonya was blessed with success and achieved some good results in cattle breeding. In three years she managed to increase the size of the cattle stock dramatically. Now the business generates at least 5,000 soms monthly. Sonya applied for a loan in order to purchase additional cattle and keep her stock big and healthy. \r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Our next creditor combines such vitally important skills as the ability to fully enjoy life and feel fulfilled. She has a big stimulus for doing it.  \r\n\r\nAigul M., 38, is a leader of this group.  Despite her young age, Aigul already is a proud mother of eight children, the oldest one of whom is 21. Aigul admits that having such a big and united family is the main and most important accomplishment for her. She tries to develop a strong sense of family ties in every one of her children. Aigul\u2019s oldest son and daughter are currently in Russia. This country provides better employment and earnings, rather than their motherland. Her children do their best to take part in helping with the family budget, because it requires a lot of expenses to raise their younger siblings. Aigul herself has been breeding livestock for 22 years already. Having such a long experience brings its own fruits. Aigul is faster and more effective than most of her competitors. When the livestock is ready for sale, Aigul goes to a local market in a village of Ozgorush, where she performs her entrepreneurial skills. Her monthly profit is only 2,000 soms, not much for such a big family. Aigul now hopes to get a loan to purchase more livestock and resell it successfully.\r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

Helping someone else on the other part of a planet is a good way to make our world a little bit better than yesterday.\r\n\r\nGulmira N., 39, is a leader of this group. She is a resident of the small town Uzgen, Southern Kyrgyzstan, which is well-known for its special type of brown rice. Gulmira owns a small shop which offers consumer goods of all kinds. Customers from all over the neighborhood know her very well and shop at Gulmira\u2019s shop with pleasure. She has been doing it for 10 years already, so she knows goods that are valued by customers and which are not.\r\n\r\nGulmira is married and has two daughters. Her husband and the oldest daughter are at this moment in the Russian Federation, where they work and contribute some earnings to the family capital. Income generated from the running of a shop is usually spent on buying wholesale goods and equipping the shop. Gulmira is satisfied with how her business is operating, because thanks to many years of savings and persistent work, her family built a new house. As the number of residents in her neighborhood grows and inflation causes higher expenses, Gulmira had to apply for a loan in hopes of increasing the goods circulation and improving the standards of living of her family.  \r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

D. is from the village of South Cogon, Misamis Oriental. He is 45 years old, married, and has 4 adult children. To make a living, Joselito owns and operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap, canned goods, junk food, biscuits & toothpaste in the local community. He also sells electronic loads of several networks like GLOBE & SMART. Joselito has been engaged in his business for over 10 years and earns approximately 9,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Joselito joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Joselito has successfully repaid a previous loan of 11,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory and working capital. Joselito is requesting a new loan of 14,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell like canned goods & junk food. This loan will be the 4th loan taken out by Joselito from HSPFI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand his business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":700161,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Our following creditor is very unique, because he creates pieces of art.\r\n\r\nBakytbek K., 42, is a member of this group. Being inspired by successful people and historical events, Bakytbek always felt comfortable expressing his emotions in clay. Sculptures have been his passion since early childhood, when he used to make figures from sand on the beach at Lake Issyk Kul. He tried working on monuments and plates with inscriptions, and realized he could turn his hobby into a business.\r\n\r\nTo Bakytbek\u2019s surprise, this business started developing at a high pace. Now he has orders almost every day and is quite busy. Seven years have brought good results. At this moment Bakytbek earns 7,000 monthly, which supports his wife and four children financially. The purpose of his applying for a loan is to purchase raw materials for accomplishing more orders from customers. Bakytbek is very thankful to lenders, because it gives him the opportunity to express his inner world and make a living through his favorite occupation.\r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

A resident of a small town Toktogul, she is married and has three children. It\u2019s been three years since she, her husband and their younger son have been working in cattle breeding and reselling. Anarkan\u2019s husband is a driver, and despite the fact that it takes a lot of time and energy, he still does his best to help out with the family business.\r\n\r\nAnarkan herself is a consultant in a local central library. She has always enjoyed being surrounded by an aura of education and knowledge. She had to work part-time to save up for cattle breeding. The business was started three years ago with the purchase of three heads of cattle for 10,000 soms. It had been a lot of pressure, because much of the savings and a lot of hope was put into this business. It is paying off, bringing in 2,000 soms monthly. Anarkan says it\u2019s not enough for some personal purchases such as furniture.

woman that strives for beauty in life is Gemma V..  Being a Community Partner in CCT*, Gemma strives to make her business a reflection of beautiful progress.  At age 35, she rears four children who are in elementary and high school studies with her husband Dionisio, a driver.  Their family resides in Caloocan City.\r\n\r\nGemma has been running a sari-sari (variety) store of her own for three years now.  She sells products that are sought after by members of her community on a daily basis, such as sachets of seasonings, canned goods, and cold beverages.  Also, she manages to keep a manicure and pedicure business, which really sells among women in her neighborhood.  With these entrepreneurial efforts, Gemma earns around 4,750 PHP per month.\r\n\r\nTo sustain these efforts and help her grow her business, Gemma would like to request for a 9,000 PHP loan.  She will use this money to adorn her store with products that catches the eye of both regular and potential customers.  Gemma makes sure that every product she sells will be worth every centavo of her customers' money.  Part of the money will also be used in her manicure and pedicure business.\r\n\r\nAdmittedly, Gemma finds it hard to do business now that prices are high.  She knows that she cannot simply increase the prices of her retail products because her customers will be affected.  But with the loan money on hand, she will be able to buy in bulk in order to be able to purchase the products at a cheaper cost.  Gemma desires to have her own commercial space for her manicure and pedicure business, which will probably grow into a beauty parlor.  But beyond the physical growth of her business, Gemma desires to see her children graduate from college, because for her, education is one of the most beautiful things a parent can give her children.\r\n\r\nAs CCT community partner, she faithfully attends their weekly fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she received.\r\n\t\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.  The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":700166,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"Restocking inventory of variety store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Caloocan City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-01-25T18:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gemma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-01-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":9000,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2011-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2011-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2011-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2011-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2011-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2011-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2011-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2011-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2011-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2011-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2011-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":15,"local_amount":600,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:28:55Z","rounded_local_amount":665.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191396099,"comment":null},{"amount":60,"local_amount":2400,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:29:17Z","rounded_local_amount":2663.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195814208,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:37:56Z","rounded_local_amount":3328.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201256773,"comment":null},{"amount":60,"local_amount":2400,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:33:59Z","rounded_local_amount":2663.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206123466,"comment":null},{"amount":15,"local_amount":600,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:49:42Z","rounded_local_amount":665.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211194720,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-01-25T20:34:59Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T10:49:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":268188,"name":"Bernie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Bernie is a married man with a 2-year-old son.

At this time, she is working hard to be able to send her child all the way through college--a dream for most Filipino parents like Elsa as she herself has been a college undergraduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents could leave to their children.\r\n\r\nElsa operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most families only eat home-cooked meals in the evening where all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to use cooking gas and raw food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands costs less than raw food. Elsa's regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php 200 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a Php 12,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nElsa dreams of having her own house soon. She also hopes that her business will mature and be successful.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Arlene earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece.  Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php 400 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 22,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nArlene dreams of being able to renovate her house soon, with all of her work with the business. She also hopes to enlarge her current place of business and her product inventory. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php 300 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 21,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nAnita dreams that all of her children will be able to finish their studies one day and have stable jobs. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php200 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 28,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n \r\nSusan dreams that her children will be able to finish their education soon. She also hopes that her business will continue to grow. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Levie is loved by her husband Ruben, a factory worker whose primary work is to make peanuts. They live together in Tala, Caloocan City. With all the passion Levie Joy invests in her business, there\u2019s nothing that will make life bitter for her.\r\n\r\nJust like her husband, Levie is also into the peanut butter making business. She makes peanut butter that sells profitably in her community. Levie applies what she learns from CCT* as a Community Partner to make her business work. Every month she earns around 6,000 PHP.\r\n\r\nBecause Levie knows she needs some financial help for her business, she has decided to request a loan for 20,000 PHP. She will use most of this money to buy essential ingredients like peanuts, sugar, and salt. Part of the loan will go to meet the family's immediate needs such as payment of the electricity bill.\r\n\r\nLevie recognizes that the hot weather and exhaustion do keep her from functioning productively at work. But she is determined to find ways to overcome these struggles and give her full potential in developing her business. She looks forward to owning a complete set of materials for peanut butter making, which will undoubtedly boost her entrepreneurial pursuit. But more than the material achievement, Levie desires to help her community. No unrequited love is known by Levie, as she is loved by her family as much as she loves them and desires to give them a good future.\r\n\r\nFor now, Levie faithfully attends her weekly fellowship* meeting in CCT where she draws strength and inspiration from the Word of God she received and from the testimonies and real life stories being shared by her fellowship group co-partners.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":700248,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Marites M., 44, believes so, and knows further that children are our country's hope. Her value of education enabled her to reach college. She is now married to Danilo, a driver, and together they raise a child who is now a college student.\r\n\r\nMarites runs a day care school and through it, she provides education to the young kids in her community. Also, she sells Ready To Wear (RTW) clothes to business connections and friends. Having been in business for 10 years at present, she quite knows the needs of her customers, particularly those of the students in her day care school. Providing these services, she gets to earn an estimated net income around PHP 10,500 every month.\r\n\r\nTo help her provide the needs of her day care school, Marites is requesting a PHP 32,000 loan. She will use this to buy necessary school supplies and other school needs. Also, she will use this money to help her pay the school bills. Her RTW business will also benefit from this loan.\r\n\r\nMarites does not deny that there are times when the mothers of students in her school do not pay on time. But because she knows the high value of education, she will not give up just because of her present struggles. Her dream for her school is for it to have elementary levels from Grade 1 to 6. \r\n\r\nAs a CCT community partner, she allots one hour to attend their weekly fellowship* meeting.  This is where Marites can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she receives and from the testimonies and real life stories shared by her co-partners among the fellowship group.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":700273,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education

At 61, Tarcisia O. cannot have loved life more. Tarsing, as she is called by family and friends, did not even manage to finish high school, but has gone far in life. At present she attends fellowships in CCT as a Community Partner and enjoys the company of her grandchildren as she lives in Bagong Silang, a barangay of Caloocan City located on the islands of Luzon.\r\n<p>\r\nTarsing sells vegetables, meat, fish, and fruits to the community and has become an advocate for healthy eating by doing so. She starts early in the morning, offering products that are fresh and healthy. Every month, she earns an estimated net income of around 10,000 PHP.\r\n<p>\r\nTo help her grow her business, Tarcisia is requesting a 15,000 PHP loan. She plans to use this to buy more fresh supplies of meat and vegetables as well as fish and fruits. She will make sure that her products are not only fresh, but that they are also varied so as to allow more options for her customers. Tarsing also intends to add frozen foods to her goods for sale.\r\n<p>\r\nAs a local vender, Tarsing feels the weight of exhaustion and lack of sleep. Nevertheless, she is always ready to serve her fellow community members by offering and encouraging them to buy healthy foods. She wants her business to become well established and have more regular customers. She looks forward to abundant blessings from the Lord so that she may be able to help her grandchildren.\r\n<p>\r\nAs a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends their weekly fellowship meetings where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she receives.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout CCT:\r\n<p>\r\nThe Center for Community Transformation (CCT) is an organized Christian response against poverty and social injustice. This is carried out through the fusion of social development initiatives and evangelical missionary work in a uniquely Filipino context. It serves urban and rural poor communities throughout the Philippines in pursuit of its desire to see changed lives, strong families, and transformed communities centered in the Lordship of Jesus Christ. CCT is a member of the Five Talents family.\r\n<p>\r\nLocally, all CCT community partners and clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":700317,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase

They are on the average 34 years old, are all married and have at least three children each. The group members sell various items, such as clothing, fruits and vegetables, fruit juice etc.\r\n\r\nIn order to expand their business, three years ago the group members decided to participate in the credit program of Soro Yiriwaso. They are on their fourth group loan, and all prior loans have been duly repaid.\r\n\r\nFanta S. is one of the Ti\u00e8ssiri group members who sells all kinds of fruit juices, properly chilled. She is helped by a hired assistant and sometimes by her children. She plans to use her loan to purchase bags of sugar, jujube, red bissap [hibiscus], flavors, and various other ingredients that improve the taste of the juice. She sells the juices, properly chilled, out of her home, at the market of Koutiala, in front of the public school (during recess), to the policemen patrolling the road of Sikasso. She has a very diverse and varied customer base. While other members of the Ti\u00e8sseri group plan to achieve a monthly income of 160,000 West African Francs after this loan, Fanta S. plans to earn 200,000. Apart from repaying the loan, the group members will use part of their revenues towards everyday family expenses. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1575,"image":{"id":700486,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","use":"Purchasing ingredienst for preparing fruit juices                                                                                  ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"KOUTIALA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.383333 -5.466667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2011-01-27T02:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kadia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fanta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bintou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sali ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":750000,"loan_amount":1575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":93750},{"due_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":93750},{"due_date":"2011-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":93750},{"due_date":"2011-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":93750},{"due_date":"2011-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":93750},{"due_date":"2011-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":93750},{"due_date":"2011-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":93750},{"due_date":"2011-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":93750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":196.88},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":196.87},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":196.88},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":196.87},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":196.88},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":196.87},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":196.88},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":196.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":196.88,"local_amount":93750,"processed_date":"2011-01-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-17T00:57:35Z","rounded_local_amount":94574.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191606526,"comment":null},{"amount":196.87,"local_amount":93750,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:20:43Z","rounded_local_amount":94574.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195918187,"comment":null},{"amount":196.88,"local_amount":93750,"processed_date":"2011-03-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-27T08:07:15Z","rounded_local_amount":94574.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201361146,"comment":null},{"amount":196.87,"local_amount":93750,"processed_date":"2011-04-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-23T07:53:06Z","rounded_local_amount":94574.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206226424,"comment":null},{"amount":196.88,"local_amount":93750,"processed_date":"2011-05-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T12:00:52Z","rounded_local_amount":94574.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211301268,"comment":null},{"amount":196.87,"local_amount":93750,"processed_date":"2011-06-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:52:37Z","rounded_local_amount":94574.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216580862,"comment":null},{"amount":196.88,"local_amount":93750,"processed_date":"2011-07-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:30:44Z","rounded_local_amount":94574.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221750690,"comment":null},{"amount":196.87,"local_amount":93750,"processed_date":"2011-08-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T10:19:59Z","rounded_local_amount":94574.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227120056,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-01-27T07:12:49Z","paid_date":"2011-09-15T10:19:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":268327,"name":"Victor","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Victor is a married man with two children, both of whom attend school.

Because of this she decided to start her own business selling clothes, beauty products and school supplies, each product according to the season she was in.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion she has requested a loan for working capital to work with more flexibility, get good prices and above all to pay cash because with it she will buy school supplies precisely for the approaching new school term and taking advantage of her location which is very near schools which are about to reopen after long vacations.\r\n\r\nShe states that this is the reason why her investment will be successful because of the high demand from students for the merchandise she sells including school supplies, costume jewelry and lovely gift items.  These products generate a 25% profit margin.  \r\n\r\nHer dream is that her profits, generated thanks to her work discipline and all her efforts in this activity, will allow her to continue with her studies.\r\n\r\nShe currently lives with her spouse in the San Juan Nepomuceno municipality and she is preparing herself to be a businesswoman, wife and mother so that when children come she will be able to provide them with the best conditions of wellbeing possible.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":700468,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":" Will buy

At the same time, he operates a small drugstore where he sells to the local villagers whenever they become ill.  Throughout this period he has done very well and was able to obtain his own car which he uses for providing public transportation.  Now he wants to take advantage of the good prices offered for agricultural products sold at the central market in the city of Tarma.  He also wants to improve the quality of his harvest.  \r\n<p>\r\nWilfredo is a member of the Communal Bank \u201cPicaflores de Patay\u201d and receiving his fifth loan from MFP.  He is satisfied with the financial support and frequent seminars conducted to help him make progress.  Wilfredo will soon harvest his peas and gladiolas so that he can plant his next crop without delay.  Therefore he will invest this loan in the purchase of a sack of seeds for planting peas.

They live harmoniously in their own home located in the Patay neighborhood.  Every morning Manuel leaves very early for work using his own auto as public transit and covering the Tarma-Palca routes.  Meanwhile, Nerida does her part in agricultre where her main crops consist of: peas, potatoes, and the gladiolus flower.  What she likes most is being able to help her husband with the household expenses, \" I feel accomplished\", she states.  The couple travels to the capital after every harvest to sell their crops.  In the future she would like to improve her crops, starting with her gladiolus seeds; according to her the flower has great demand all year round.  She is part of the comunal bank, \"Los Pioneros de Patay\" ( The Patay Pioneers), and this is her 5th credit with MFP.  Nerida is loyal and comitted to the development of her group.  She will soon be harvesting peas, and with the solicited loan she will purchase various sacks of organic fertilizer alongside a sack of galdiolus seed that she is yet to plant until after harvest."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":700749,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase

Together, they work hard every day to make headway. For the past three years this enterprising woman has made a living selling fruit juices on order. She prepares the juices at home and then delivers them to her neighbors who order them. She says the work is very calming and allows her to earn some more money to support her family. Furthermore, during the larger portion of the day she dedicates herself to a soup kitchen she runs out of her home, where she serves as a community leader. She and others deliver meals throughout the neighborhood. As a community leader, she knows that she must distribute the food equally among the area's poor families, and she carries out her work with a lot of satisfaction. For the future, she plans to expand her juice bar and make it a permanent business so she can sell in larger quantities and increase her revenue. This is her seventh loan with Kiva partner MFP, and she promises to make her payments on time because she doesn't want to look bad to the people who have made this possible and allowed her to continue working in search of progress. Mar\u00eda plans to invest this loan in the purchase of wholesale ingredients that she needs for her juice business. She also wants to to make some improvements to the soup kitchen by adding new products, and in this way she hopes to continue moving ahead."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":700769,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

It consists of six female members who know each other and are neighbors. The members of the group are: Misael B. N., who plans to use the loan to purchase fruits, jicamas, bananas, mandarins, vegetables and chicken to sell by the piece or by the kilo; Norma C. R. plans to purchase women's purses and men's wallets to stock her business; Eva Rodr\u00edguez A. plans to purchase cosmetics to sell and to stock her business; Minerva R. E. plans to purchase all kinds of women's shoes to sell; Roxana A. R. plans to purchase undergarments in bulk to store her business; \u00c1ngela Josefina E. Linarten plans to buy a catalog to sell shoes.<p>\r\nMisael is 38 years old and has a high school education. She lives with her common-law husband, who works in a body shop and is a mechanic. They have three children who lives at home and go to school: Diego, 8; Paola, 11; and Lupita, 15. Misael has a business selling fruits, vegetables and chicken, and she also sells Jafra-brand products (clothes and shoes) via catalog. She is requesting the loan to purchase fruits, vegetables and chicken as well as the catalog items and gift items such as bracelets and paintings. All kinds of people come to her business, women, men, and many boys and girls. She offers her customers chicken by the piece or kilo, vegetables, fruits, dried chiles, perfumes, cosmetics, hair dye, shoes and clothing. She started her business selling Jafra-brand clothes and shoes via catalog for the past 10 years, and has been selling fruits, vegetables and chicken for the past four months. She started helping out a women selling items via catalog and later bought the catalogs for herself to start her own business. The work is easy. She puts down the number of the color and the page of the model. The shoes are the easiest to sell. The customers ask for the catalogs and the sale is secure. Misael has her business on the corner where her mother-in-law lives, and her husband gave her what she needed to invest in the purchase of fruits and vegetables. She got the bananas in boxes and the rest of the produce by the kilo. The business is a block from her home and she transports the supplies with a hand truck. Her business is important because it helps cover her children's education and gives them food to take to school. Her favorite part of her job is that if her children want something or something is missing they can just get it from her and she doesn't have to worry. She likes everything about her business and it makes her content and she feels proud she can help her husband with expenses. Misael can remember a time when she didn't have money and she had to rummage for clothing. She had some money saved in her closet, which served her well. Her business faces the challenge of higher costs for tomatoes and fruit when prices rise, and she faces competition in selling shoes and perfume since there are various people who sell via catalog. She uses her profits to cover her children's school expenses, and her daughter uses the perfume and shoes she sells. Misael is planning to expand her business with more dried chiles, beans, corn meal, and plastic containers. <p>\r\nJantetelco is a peaceful village. Her neighbors are friendly and respectful. The countryside is beautiful but lacks trees. They celebrate June 29, St. Peter's Day, with Masses, and on Dec. 13 there is a big parade to commemorate Mexican hero Marino Matamoros that goes from various places in the states of Puebla and Morelos. <p>\r\nMisael's business has help her family a lot by providing everyone with food. She wants to buy some more land and build more rooms. Her plans and hopes are to have a little car to transport all of her merchandise and to go to the center for her fruits and vegetables. She is very content with loan because she plans to purchase more produce.

He is 41 years old and married with two kids.  He has a basic education, having only reached sixth grade.  Since then, he's worked in agriculture.  He began working in agriculture with his parents when he was very young, mainly cleaning and watering.  His father helped Lester with his personal finances so he could study.\r\n\r\nWhen Lester was 15 years old, his father died, leaving Lester in charge of his family since he was the eldest brother.  Lester dedicated himself to producing the five parcels of land his father left to the family.

He separated with his wife a number of years ago and his five children are already grown up and working. This enterprising man makes a living in construction. Since he was a young man he learned from watching his relatives who worked in the trade. Currently he has a construction company, and although he lacks a few permits he manages with three other workers. He oversees them since he is the master builder. He really enjoys his work and says it is heartwarming to see the big jobs completed with good results. It's for this reason he has various clients who recommend him, and he doesn't lack for work since he is always starting or completing construction. For the future, he plans on purchasing a pickup truck so that his workers can move around without problems. This is his fifth loan with Kiva partner MFP, and he promises to make his payments on time since he doesn't want to be in bad standing with the people who made this support possible and so that he can continue working in search of progress. Abraham plans to invest the loan in the purchase of a cement mixing machine since it is an instrument he is missing in order to finish his jobs more quickly, and he calculates that he will earn better profits."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":700776,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction","sector":"Construction","use":"Purchase a cement mixing machine","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-01-27T04:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abraham ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-01-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":199.17},{"due_date":"2011-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":219.88},{"due_date":"2011-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":220.95},{"due_date":"2011-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":228.68},{"due_date":"2011-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":234.16},{"due_date":"2011-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":244.88},{"due_date":"2011-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":251.49},{"due_date":"2011-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":260.6},{"due_date":"2011-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":271.37},{"due_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":278.82},{"due_date":"2011-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":291.32},{"due_date":"2012-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":298.68}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.03},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.62},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.02},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.85},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.85},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.79},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.22},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.55},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.5},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.24},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.81},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.52}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":81.15,"local_amount":221.33,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:52:03Z","rounded_local_amount":224.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195887259,"comment":null},{"amount":81.16,"local_amount":221.35,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:38:32Z","rounded_local_amount":224.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201327620,"comment":null},{"amount":86.06,"local_amount":234.72,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:32:36Z","rounded_local_amount":238.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206196155,"comment":null},{"amount":95.3,"local_amount":259.91,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:41:34Z","rounded_local_amount":264.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211269832,"comment":null},{"amount":94.92,"local_amount":258.86,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:33:14Z","rounded_local_amount":263.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216549853,"comment":null},{"amount":166.85,"local_amount":455.05,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:56:45Z","rounded_local_amount":462.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238665792,"comment":null},{"amount":175.99,"local_amount":479.96,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:24Z","rounded_local_amount":487.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244620966,"comment":null},{"amount":318.57,"local_amount":868.82,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:18:53Z","rounded_local_amount":882.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257244998,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-01-27T14:07:07Z","paid_date":"2012-02-15T11:18:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":268429,"name":"Mujeres Laboriosas Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Carolina Maribel C.

She learned the skill when she was young and has gained experience over time and has been able to provide for her family in this manner.\r\n\r\nCurrently she operates a salon in her home Monday through Saturday all day long.  She has many customers who go to her for haircuts and styling because she offers good service and low prices.  She is very satisfied with her business and has a steady income.  She hopes to expand business and acquire the best beauty salon tools available.  This is the 11th loan through MFP and she is committed to paying it back on time since she would not want to disappoint the people who have made it possible.\r\n\r\nGladys plans to use the loan to buy items for her beauty salon which she needs urgently such as: hairdryer, hair color and scissors.  She hopes to improve her service this way.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":700798,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from raising pigs for sale. Virgilla has been engaged in this business for more than 15 years and earns approximately 3500 Philippine pesos (PHP) a month from the business.\r\n\r\nVirgilla joined PMPC in 2009 to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Virgilla has successfully repaid a previous PMPC loan of 10,000 PHP, which she used to purchase breeding livestock. She is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will likewise be used to purchase breeding livestock. This will be her fifth loan from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's general living conditions.\r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

She lives in Lapu-Lapu City, Cebu.  She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2008 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts.  By working hard in her general store, passenger jeep and BBQ businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. \r\n\r\nShe now earns an average monthly income of 16,800 PHP.  Estela is borrowing 17,000 PHP so that she can fund her business operations. This will be her 6th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon.  Her previous loan of 13,000 PHP, which she paid off well within its term was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom.  Estela aspires to improve her family's living conditions and ensure their future well being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work. \r\n\r\nHelp NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by clicking  the link to the   NWTF Kiva lending team  on Kiva.org to join our

Mary Ann is requesting a new loan of 16,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase raw ingredients such as flour, eggs, and milk. This loan will be Mary Ann's fifth loan from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

She makes a living by running a sari-sari (or variety) store, where she sells items people need daily such as shampoo, soap, canned goods, snacks and toothpaste. She has been in this business for more than two years and earns about 6,000 PHP a month from her work.\r\n\r\nLast year, Rosie joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her life and ability to engage in business. She has successfully repaid her first loan, which was for 5,000 PHP, from HSPFI. Now she is applying for a second loan, for 8,000 PHP, to buy additional products, such as canned food and beverages, to sell to her customers. She plans to use the additional revenue she earns from this loan to continue expanding her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

He serves other business people who operate motorbikes and bicycles. He says that this business is profitable and the major challenges he has are financial constraints and the fact that some spare parts are not readily available. However, he works very hard to keep his business doing well. \r\n\r\nHe is using his loan of 50,000 Kenyan shillings to buy more spare chains, bulbs, spokes and other parts to use to repair the motorbikes and bicycles brought to him.

Ruth S., 43, knows this, and gives her best to accomplish the goals she has set for her and her family. She finished a high school education and is married to Reynaldo S., her business partner who serve as a cook the their food stall. They have four children; with one attending college, two in high school and one in elementary school. Ruth\u2019s family resides in Baseco Port Area, Manila.\r\n\r\nRuth presently runs a sari-sari (variety) store which caters to those customers needs that are more immediate than the nearest grocerystore. Along with this, she also manages her food stall that offers all kinds of viands that her local community is used to eating during meal time. Ruth has been into these kind of businesses for several years and has gained regular customers who keep her businesses alive. She employs no one and mobilize members of her family to help her business run well.  With this, Ruth earns an estimated net income of around Php900 per day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating businesses, she would like to request a loan for a Php12,000. She will use this to buy goods that her customers prefer. She will see to it that her store will not lack any particular item that her customers need, This will make her the number one sari-sari store in the community.  She will also use part of this loan to purchase more raw ingredients that are needed to continue operation of her food stall.\r\n\r\nRuth has learned the value of improving one\u2019s business. She also has experienced terrible tragedy in her live, five years ago, when their entire community was consumed by fire including her house and business.  Despite all of this, she remained focus on how to sustain her family, used her savings in CCT to start up a small business and eventually grew and rebuilt their house and their growing business. Goals cannot be met just by identifying the problem, but by acting on them. One most important goal she has is to support her children until their college graduation which she will feel greatly fulfilled her dream.\r\n\r\nAs of now, Ruth enjoys attending the fellowship* meeting in CCT where she also gained strength and inspiration from the Word of God she received. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":701004,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy
