was among the first MicroInvest clients\/borrowers in Spitamen. Since then for the last 5 years she has been one of the best clients for MicroInvest in the region. It was her example that helped many others gain trust in the loan program and to become clients themselves.  <p>Tuhtajon is 55 years old, married and has 4 children. All her children now have families of their own.  Her husband also works and helps her out in the stall on weekends.  Loans play a big part in Tuhtajon\u2019s business, allowing her to buy her inventory wholesale. The profit she makes significantly helps the family budget and Tuhtajon considers it her duty to help her husband support the family.  The extra money also allows her buy sweet treats for her grandchildren when they come to visit their grandmother. <p><b>Translated from Russian by Olga Espira, Kiva

 Halikova has a very big family. It numbers 8 people, 6 of whom are children.  Naturally in order to feed everyone one needs to have a good income. Since good jobs are hard to come by, Izzatoi decided to go into retail trade.  She sells an assortment of small items at a market stall.  Her husband works loading and unloading freight in the same market.  Her eldest son does various odd jobs.  Her two elder daughters help her out in the market stall.  The profits from the business help sustain the family budget.  She plans to use the new loan to expand her business.\t\t\r\n <p><b>Translated from Russian by Olga Espira, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\u0423 \u0418\u0437\u0437\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0439

Over time she decided to start her own business. Her husband provided her with the startup capital. She has also obtained a loan from MicroInvest. Since then, her business has gotten significantly larger. Uguljon is 45 and married. Both her husband and her elder son work. Her younger son and her daughter help her with the business. She purchases a portion of her goods from wholesalers at the market where she works. She also purchases goods in the city of Hudjan, located 35 kilometers away from where she lives and works.

She said, \u201cI do not know how I could feed my children if I did not get loans from SMT\u201d.  <P>Like many widows and other poor women who received loans from SMT, Marie can now serve her children with at least two meals a day.

More than 25 years ago, he began to see the need to sell brooms in his village, and took the opportunity. At the start he charged very little, and sold his products door to door, little by little earning more and being able to support his family. Today he sells his brooms from a bike and hopes to be able to buy a truck in the future, to be able to increase his earnings.

Sudah lima tahun dia tinggal tempat yang sekarang ini. Dia tinggal bersama isteri dan 5 orang anaknya. Anaknya yang sulung berumur 11 tahun. Dia bekerja sebagai pemulung bersama isterinya. Mereka menekuni usaha ini baru sekitar satu tahun. Mereka memilih sebuah mobil pick up untuk mengambil barang-barang rongsokan di sekitar Kota Denpasar, yaitu hotel \u2013 hotel yang sudah menjadi langganannya. Pada pagi hari mereka keliling untuk mengambil barang-barang rongsokan. Dan siang harinya mereka bawa pulang untuk dipilih dan dikumpulkan sesuai dengan jenis barang lalu ditimbang. Setelah itu dibawa ke tempat penjualannya di Jl. Mertasari - tidak jauh dari tempat tinggal mereka. Usaha ini memberikan keuntungan mencapai Rp 3.000.000,00\/bulan. Biaya hidup yang mencapai Rp 50.000,00\/hari dan biaya pendidikan anak sebesar Rp 200.000,00\/bulan membuat mereka harus bekerja dengan keras. Begitulah pekerjaan yang dilakukan sehari-hari. Suja\u2019i dan isterinyanya berharap banyak dengan pinjaman yang mereka peroleh. Modal ini akan membantu mereka untuk lebih banyak memperoleh barang rongsokan untuk dibeli dan dikumpulkan. Semakin besar modal yang mereka miliki, akan semakin besar pula keuntungan yang akan mereka dapat. Masa depan anak \u2013 anak mereka bergantung pada usaha ini."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":75567,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Waste Management","sector":"Services","use":"To buy items to be recycled<p>Membeli barang - barang rongsokan","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Badung","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.5 115.333333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2007-10-16T19:25:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Suja'i","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-10-30T20:01:47Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":175,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2007-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2008-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2008-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2008-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":35,"local_amount":35,"processed_date":"2007-11-23T04:27:51Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-30T10:04:45Z","rounded_local_amount":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":85264,"comment":null},{"amount":35,"local_amount":35,"processed_date":"2007-12-30T10:19:21Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-30T10:04:45Z","rounded_local_amount":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":105071,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":18,"local_amount":18,"processed_date":"2008-01-30T03:01:26Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-30T10:04:45Z","rounded_local_amount":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":124088,"comment":null},{"amount":52,"local_amount":52,"processed_date":"2008-02-29T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-30T10:04:45Z","rounded_local_amount":52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144904,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":35,"local_amount":35,"processed_date":"2008-03-30T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-30T10:04:45Z","rounded_local_amount":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":169215,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2007-10-16T20:01:47Z","paid_date":"2008-03-30T10:04:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":21341,"name":"Eam","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Eam O. is 27 years old and a mother of three young children.

She lives with husband and two children, including grandchild. Siti has a small food stall in front of her home. This food stall is where she sells food, like: Rujak, tipat cantok (local food types), and other small food. Per day her gross income is about Rp150,000.00 (about US$16.50), with expenses of Rp 50,000.00 (about $5.50)\/day. The raw materials she bought in the market herself - not far from home. Although 54 years old, her energy to earn for husband and herself is still high. Her husband is sick - so he could not work - plus his sight is blurred. In their age, she is not expecting much; she hopes her business could help her provide enough income for her husband's and her own needs. Loan from Dinari will be used to increase business capital.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Gwan Liong Ang, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nSiti mulai usaha jual makanan ini sekitar 10 tahun yang lalu. Dia tinggal bersama suami dan anaknya yang kedua \u2013 termasuk cucunya. Siti mempunyai warung kecil di depan rumahnya. Warung inilah tempatnya menjual makanan, antara lain : rujak, tipat cantok dan makanan kecil lainnya. Per hari penghasilan kotornya mencapai Rp 150.000,00 dengan biaya hidup Rp 50.000,00\/hari. Bahan baku untuk jualan dibelinya sendiri di pasar \u2013 tidak jauh dari tempat tinggalnya. Walau sudah berumur 54 tahun, semangatnya untuk menafkahi suami dan diri sendiri masih besar.

market opportunities. I Komang Suarta farms a family inherited farm of 75 are (about 7500 square meters). While waiting for the rain, where afterwards rice would be planted, I Komang Suarta and wife Ni Ketut Sriani used it to plant several assortment of vegetables and chili. His primadona vegetable is long beans, since they have planted this vegetable several times, and the results are also quite promising. With a capital of Rp3,500,000 (about US$390) in one planting period (3 months) I Komang Suarta could profit Rp2,000,000 (about $220). Long beans could be harvest as many as 20-25X plucking per period, at 40-90 days and plucking is done once every two days. His harvest could be bought by vegetable sales persons directly from plucking location.\r\nI Komang Suarta is quite happy with his results, therefore I Komang Suarta could finance the needs of their 2 small children, and save for their future education. Besides that I Komang Suarta is also proud to provide jobs for daily workers at the plucking time of the harvest.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Gwan Liong Ang, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nSebagai seorang petani yang mengandalkan seluruh biaya kehidupan keluarganya melalui hasil dari bercocok tanam , I Komang Suarta sangat pandai dalam memanfaatkan situasi, kesempatan dan juga peluang pasar yang ada. I Komang Suarta mengolah sebidang tanah dengan luas 75 Are yang masih merupakan tanah waris milik keluarga. Sambil menunggu musim hujan turun, yang nantinya akan ditanami padi  oleh I Komang Suarta dan istrinya, Ni Ketut Sriani, di manfaatkan dengan menanami berbagai jenis tanaman sayur \u2013sayuran dan cabai.  Sayuran yang menjadi primadonanya adalah kacang panjang karena menanam sayuran ini sudah sering dilakukannya dan hasilnya pun cukup menjanjikan . Dengan modal sebesar Rp 3.500.000,- dalam satu periode penanaman ( 3 Bulan ) I Komang Suarta bisa mendapat keuntungan Rp 2.000.000,-.  Tanaman kacang panjang bisa berbuah dan di panen sebanyak  20 - 25 kali petik per satu periode,  yaitu dari tanaman berumur 40-90 hari dan pemetikan dilakukan setiap dua hari sekali. Hasil panennya biasanya dibeli oleh para pedagang sayur yang langsung datang ke lokasi pemetikan . \r\nI Komang Suarta cukup senang  dengan hasil yang di peroleh ,karena dengan itu I Komang Suarta dapat membiayai kebutuhan 2 orang  anaknya yang masih kecil dan menabung untuk biaya pendidikannya nanti . Disamping itu juga I Komang Suarta merasa bangga bisa menciptakan lapangan pekerjaan bagi beberapa orang yang di bayar harian pada saat pemetikan hasil panennya."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":75619,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy long bean seeds, fertilizer, pesticides, and maintenance expenses<p>Membeli bibit kacang panjang, pupuk, obat - obatan dan biaya perawatan","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2007-10-16T21:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"I Komang Suarta","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-10-31T01:20:33Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":400,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":66.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2007-11-05T01:22:56Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-03T02:47:28Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":76339,"comment":null},{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2007-11-30T02:50:17Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-03T02:47:28Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":88546,"comment":null},{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2007-12-31T08:48:08Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-03T02:47:28Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":105301,"comment":null},{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2008-02-01T01:06:24Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-03T02:47:28Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":125375,"comment":null},{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2008-03-03T01:55:54Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-03T02:47:28Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":147607,"comment":null},{"amount":65,"local_amount":65,"processed_date":"2008-04-03T02:47:28Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-03T02:47:28Z","rounded_local_amount":65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":171967,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2007-10-17T01:20:33Z","paid_date":"2008-04-03T02:47:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":21355,"name":"Pit","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Pit S., 56, widowed, works selling vegetables at an open-air market, and generally earns around US$6 a day in revenue.

Especially since married to Putu Putri Ariani, his responsibility has increased to provide a living for a wife and two children. Therefore Komang Muriada has to work hard to obtain enough income to support continued family living. Several work as laborer has been tried, however the income was not enough to support ever increasing family needs. Finally Komang Muriada follows his parents footsteps to work as a farmer. He works on the 40 are (about 4000 square meters) land owned by his parents with Dinari's loan. Komang Muriada started this new work since last year. As with othe farmers in his village, Komang Muriada also plants long bean vegetables on the land. From working the land, planting seeds, fertilized it, to spraying was done by Komang Muriada himself. During harvest time Komang Muriada is getting help from his wife and 2 daily laborers at a rate of Rp20,000 (about US$2.20)\/day. In one plucking day harvest, Komang Muriada could make about 100 bunches (about 1 kg\/bunch), which he sold for Rp2500-Rp3000 (about 30-35 cents). This was done once every two days. Long beans could be pluck about 25-30X per period (3 months).  Within a period Komang Muriada could produce about Rp 6,000,000 (about US$660) in income. After subtracting Expenses for fertilizers, pesticides, labor cost, etc his net profit is Rp2,050,000 (about US$220)\/ 3 months.

Berbagai  pekerjaan sebagai buruh sudah di cobanya, namun hasilnya tak cukup untuk memenuhi kebutuhan rumah tangganya yang semakin meningkat.

Menggarap tanah seluas 40 Are milik orang tua dan dengan  modal pinjaman dari Dinari, Komang Muriada memulai  menekuni pekerjaan barunya sejak tahun lalu . Seperti halnya petani lain di desanya Komang muriada juga menanami tanah garapannya dengan tanaman sayuran yaitu kacang panjang. Dari mengolah tanah,  menanam bibit , memupuk dan menyemprot di kerjakan Komang Muriada sendiri . Sedangkan pada waktu musim panen Komang Muriada di bantu oleh istri dan juga ada dua orang tenaga buruh yang di bayar harian sebesar Rp 20.000,-  . Dalam sekali petik hasil panen, Komang Muriada bisa mencapai 100 ikat ( beratnya kurang lebih 1 kg) , yang per ikat nya di jual Rp. 2.500,- s\/d Rp. 3.000.,-  Itu dilakukan tiap dua hari sekali . Tanaman kacang panjang bisa dipanen sebanyak 20 s\/d 25 kali dalam satu periode ( 3 Bulan ) Dalam satu periode Komang Muriada mendapat hasil produksi sebesar Rp. 6.000.000,-   dan keuntungan yang di peroleh setelah di potong biaya bibit, pupuk , obat-obatan , ongkos buruh dan lain-lain  adalah sebesar Rp.  2.050.000,- \/ tiga bulan .

She has been doing it to increase family's income. Her husband's income is Rp700,000.00 (about US$77)\/month. That amount is certainly not sufficient. Daily expenses are about Rp30,000.00 (about $3.30), rent for house and food stall. Although her 2 children are independent, she has to work. The rice stall business gives her gross profit of Rp100,000 (about $11). The distance she has to take between her house and her rice stall is about 2 km.  Her rice stall location is quite strategic. One factor is that the road is quite busy. That fact is also supported that the food Sadwathi sells are liked by her customers. Also the many building laborers working around Sadwathi's food-stall. Raw materials prices are quite high, but this mother relies on capital to buy enough raw materials. The to be obtained loan would be used to add to her capital.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Gwan Liong Ang, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nSadwathi memiliki usaha warung nasi. Dia menekuni usaha ini untuk menambah penghasilan keluarga. Penghasilan suaminya per bulan Rp 700.000,00. Uang sejumlah itu tentu saja masih belum mencukupi. Biaya hidup per hari Rp 30.000,00, kontrakkan baik untuk rumah maupun untuk warung nasinya. Walaupun kedua anaknya sudah mandiri, dia harus bekerja. Usaha warung nasinya ini memberikan keuntungan kotor per hari mencapai Rp 100.000,00. Jarak yang harus dia tempuh dari rumah menuju warung \u00b1 2 km. Letak warung nasinya cukup strategis. Salah satu faktornya jalur yang melewatinya cukup ramai. Hal tersebut juga didukung oleh makanan yang dijual Sadwathi diminati oleh pelanggan. Hasilnya penjualannya pun sangat bagus. Hal ini ditambah dengan banyaknya buruh bangunan yang bekerja di sekitar warung Sadwathi. Harga bahan baku sekarang memang cukup tinggi, tapi ibu ini memanfaatkan modal yang ada untuk membeli bahan baku yang cukup. Pinjaman yang dia peroleh akan dia manfaatkan untuk menambah modal yang sudah dia miliki."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":75630,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"To buy rice, vegetable and spices\r\n<p>Membeli beras, sayur, dan bumbu.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Badung","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.5 115.333333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2007-10-16T23:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nyoman Sadwathi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-10-31T00:30:41Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":125,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2007-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2007-11-23T04:27:51Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-31T10:05:22Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":85266,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2007-12-31T08:48:08Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-31T10:05:22Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":105300,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-01-30T03:01:42Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-31T10:05:22Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":124114,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-02-29T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-31T10:05:22Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144905,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-03-31T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-31T10:05:22Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":169889,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2007-10-17T00:30:41Z","paid_date":"2008-03-31T10:05:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":21360,"name":"Gulbakhar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"N.

I Komang Mertajiwa supports his family by plating vegetable in a 35 acre land. With the help form his wife Desak Putu Pujawati they work on this since 1999. They had to stop because they use their capital to put their children to school. But 2 years ago they came back to this business on a borrowed capital. In 30 acres of land the plant long beans, and the cost for 3 months operations for insecticides and fertilizers is  Rp. 2.750.000 while the profit is only Rp. 5.400.000, to get a higher profit they have to go to a bigger town to sell their product. Even though is not easy, Mertajiwa  keep striving on because his children are still schooling, where one of their child is still in primary while another just started secondary, which will incur more cost for them.\r\n\r\n <p><b>Translated from Bahasa by Bernard, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nTinggal di rumah yang sangat sederhana dengan dinding gedek dan masih beralaskan lantai tanah , I Komang Mertajiwa menghidupi kelurganya hanya dari hasil berkebun sayur-sayuran  yang di tanam di tanah  sakapan ( mengerjakan tanah orang lain dengan bagi hasil ) seluas 35 Are. Dengan dukungan dari Desak Putu Pujawati, istrinya,  Komang Mertajiwa telah menekuni pekerjaannya ini sejak tahun 1999,walau sebelumnya sempat terhenti karena modalnya di pergunakan untuk membiayai sekolah anaknya. Namun sejak 2 tahun terakhir Komang Mertajiwa kembali memulai usahanya dengan menggunakan modal  pinjaman, dan tanaman yang di tanam pun masih jenis  sayur \u2013 sayuran yaitu sayur kacang panjang .\r\n      Dari sekitar 30 Are tanah yang ditanami kacang panjang  Mertajiwa menghabiskan modal untuk beli bibit, pupuk , obat-obatan dan juga biaya oprasional lainnya sebesar Rp. 2.750.000,- \/ periode masa tanam ( 3 bulan ) . Sedangkan untuk hasil panen yang di dapat dalam satu periode adalah Rp. 5.400.000,- Untuk mendapatkan harga pasaran yang lebih tinggi, hasil kebunnya langsung di jual ke pasar umum yang ada di kota Negara.  Bahkan kadang \u2013kadang Mertajiwa juga mengambil hasil panen petani lain yang kemudian di jual lagi ke pasar sebagi penghasilan tambahan . Meski sangat melelahkan , Mertajiwa tetap semangat dan tekun dalam bekerja mengingat  tiga orang anaknya yang kini sudah  bersekolah. Anaknya yang pertama di SMP dan dua orang lagi masih di bangku SD, yang tentunya membutuhkan biaya yang semakin besar.

Karena ketekunannya berusaha, kini warung kecil itu telah berubah menjadi sebuah warung cukup besar untuk ukuran di desanya dengan jenis makanan yang lebih bervariasi. Memulai buka warung dari pukul 07:00 pagi sampai dengan pukul 21:00 malam, Sueli mampu meraup keuntungan sebesar Rp 65.000,- terutama dari penjualan gado - gadonya yang memiliki rasa yang khas dan banyak di sukai oleh para pelanggan.

She is applying for  a loan to be used for purchasing a breeding pig, growing piglets and feeds.
