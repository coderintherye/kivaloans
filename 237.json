It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b><br>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

sells a variety of men's shoes in the local market.

She has had this retail business for about 10 years and is in the process of expanding it. \r\n\r\nSanam lives in the town of Tursunzade with her husband and four children. She has requested a loan of 2500 Somoni to increase her working capital and help sustain her business. Purchasing inventory from wholesalers has required a substantial investment from Sanam which is why she decided to obtain a loan. This loan will give her added flexibility and will help cover some of her growing expenses while she develops a larger business. Additional profits generated by her business will provide her with a stable income and the ability to support her family financially. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its epic mountain passes and its rich history which includes its place as a key post along the Silk Road and events at the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Umarali is an experienced bread baker. He has been doing this business for more than 3 years. He is baking the national bread \u201clepeshka\u201d at home. His father and sister help him with his business. Having many customers, Umarali sells the majority of his products just from his home. However, he runs a trading place in the central local market where he also sells \u201dlepeshka\u201d. Umarali is requesting $2000 USD in order to purchase, at wholesale prices, the flour required for his bread baking. Umarali is grateful for all supporting him and promises to manage the loan with accuracy.  \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Mukadas is a brave, married woman who works hard for the good of her 4 children. The strict discipline she uses with her children allows her to count on her household\u2019s advice and support in working the fields. Mukadas\u2019s children\u2019s grateful attitude continues to encourage her, and they have gathered many lessons during this time that they can use when they form their own households. What Mukadas urgently needs right now are fertilizers and other chemicals for cultivating her land and to be prepared for upcoming growing season. Mukadas doesn\u2019t need just good land, she also needs a friendly hand to help her out.\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

Ribbim now lives with his wife and their 4 children. They are also responsible for caring for his elderly parents. Ribbim is a farmer. Recognized by the people of the neighborhood as a serious man, Ribbim would like to expand his crop into a viable source of income. In order to do that, he needs a loan of 8000 Somoni to buy seeds and fertilizer to expand his crop. The income from the sale of this crop will then help him to cope with the needs of his large family and to educate all his children to a higher level of education. Ribbim is very grateful to everyone who is helping him to achieve his dreams with this loan.  \r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She also has a business doing agriculture.  In that business, she grows rice and fufu.     \r\n\r\nThis is her second loan, and she will be restocking her market stand.  Right now her table is very bare from the sales she has made, so she will be restocking.

She would like her business to be stable so she can offer her children stability. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Shelly Hubman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":343180,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"capital de trabajo","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-07-01T19:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lucia Ramona ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":4500,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2009-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2009-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":450}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":900,"processed_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-05T09:30:54Z","rounded_local_amount":955.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":66055729,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":450,"processed_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T15:29:56Z","rounded_local_amount":477.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73599953,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":450,"processed_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T17:58:02Z","rounded_local_amount":477.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87035842,"comment":null},{"amount":25.99,"local_amount":467.81,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T21:42:19Z","rounded_local_amount":496.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96948237,"comment":null},{"amount":25.18,"local_amount":453.32,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:33:08Z","rounded_local_amount":481.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103790167,"comment":null},{"amount":25.11,"local_amount":451.93,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:33:45Z","rounded_local_amount":480.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110680837,"comment":null},{"amount":25.18,"local_amount":453.21,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:35:00Z","rounded_local_amount":481.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118075373,"comment":null},{"amount":23.54,"local_amount":423.73,"processed_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:09:09Z","rounded_local_amount":450.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123911425,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":450,"processed_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-06T07:51:06Z","rounded_local_amount":477.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128947274,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-07-01T21:04:23Z","paid_date":"2010-05-06T07:51:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":118334,"name":"Nelly","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Se\u00f1ora Nelly Vel\u00e1squez C. tiene la edad de 42 a\u00f1os, es madre soltera.

He is a very honorable and hard-working man and since he was young he started a business selling fish because of their great demand as a nutritious food.  He gets up very early to buy in bulk from his provider, and he sells from his small stall in the Huamantanga market, in the district of Puente iedra which is 3 hours from the centre of Lima.  His sales are very good as Dionisio is very charismatic and no one can resist being convinced by his product.  He is always careful to ensure that the fish he sells are in the best condition possible and that he is selling quality produce. Dionisio has always liked his work and he does it happily.  his daughter sometimes helps him out with the clients when he has to go and get more produce.  \r\n<p>\r\nHowever, his work is not easy as he must stay at his stall until he has sold everything - he cannot keep anything until the next day - and he sometimes loses out which cannot happen often for the good of Dionicio and his daughter. They both put a lot of effort into seeing the business grow, hoping for a larger stall where they could sell a wider variety of produce in the future.  This is his third loan with Microfinanzas PRISMA, and Dionicio is known by all his colleagues as being punctual with payments, and this is why they look up to him an trust in his responsability. With this loan he will buy a bigger load of fish to increase the sales from his stall.\r\n<p><br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Liz Harvey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":343231,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","use":"To increase merchandise\/Incremento de mercader\u00eda","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lijma","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-06-26T12:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dionicio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":457.23},{"due_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":468.01},{"due_date":"2009-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":487.37},{"due_date":"2009-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":507.52},{"due_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":529.97},{"due_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":549.9}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":152.41},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.46},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":169.17},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":176.66},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":183.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":152.41,"local_amount":457.23,"processed_date":"2009-07-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:43:35Z","rounded_local_amount":464.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211924,"comment":null},{"amount":156,"local_amount":468.01,"processed_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:24:27Z","rounded_local_amount":475.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641452,"comment":null},{"amount":162.46,"local_amount":487.37,"processed_date":"2009-09-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:37:52Z","rounded_local_amount":494.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080891,"comment":null},{"amount":169.17,"local_amount":507.52,"processed_date":"2009-10-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:09:41Z","rounded_local_amount":515.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997032,"comment":null},{"amount":176.66,"local_amount":529.97,"processed_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:55:09Z","rounded_local_amount":537.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842371,"comment":null},{"amount":183.3,"local_amount":549.9,"processed_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:23:02Z","rounded_local_amount":558.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110733941,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-06-26T16:36:29Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:23:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":118358,"name":"Georgina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Georgina B. is forty-one years old.

With her loan she will purchase pigs and in the future she would like to have a large farm to rear them. \r\n<p>\r\nHilda learned to embroider and sew when she was a little girl, activities she still does and which have paid for her education. Hilda is looking to save her money to set up an artisanal workshop. \r\n<p>\r\nLidia is single without kids and has a small grocery store, which provides customers with new products every time she receives a loan. Her goal is to eventually have a large, well-stocked store and continue saving so that when she has kids they will not go without.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Laurie Paguio, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1825,"image":{"id":343282,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy merchandise, cattle, and raw materials for their businesses","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Huancavelica","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.766667 -74.983333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2009-07-02T17:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1825,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adela Beatriz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Betty","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gilberto","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hilda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lidia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lorenza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":5500,"loan_amount":1825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":916.65},{"due_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":916.75},{"due_date":"2009-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":916.65},{"due_date":"2009-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":916.65},{"due_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":916.65},{"due_date":"2009-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":916.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":304.16},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":304.19},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":304.16},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":304.16},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":304.16},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":304.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":304.28,"local_amount":917,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T13:34:51Z","rounded_local_amount":926.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63171528,"comment":null},{"amount":304.07,"local_amount":916.4,"processed_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T14:54:34Z","rounded_local_amount":925.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73596832,"comment":null},{"amount":304.16,"local_amount":916.65,"processed_date":"2009-09-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T16:48:15Z","rounded_local_amount":926.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87032225,"comment":null},{"amount":912.49,"local_amount":2749.95,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-26T09:02:50Z","rounded_local_amount":2778.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96944498,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-07-16T21:11:13Z","paid_date":"2009-11-26T09:02:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":118383,"name":"Clara","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Clara es socia del Bancomunal Antares.\nClara es  de Piura, enviudo hace diecinueve a\u00f1os, tiene 70 a\u00f1os, cinco hijos todos mayores y son profesionales.\nClara empez\u00f3 vendiendo abarrotes en sus casa, hasta que se dio una oportunidad  de comprar un puesto en un mercado, lo compro con la ayuda de sus hijos y los  ahorros que tenia,  se puso  a vender abarrotes desde hace  27 a\u00f1os \nDesde que Clara esta en Finca ha sido una ayuda para crecer en  su negocio, ha recibido charlas las cuales han ayudado  ha organizarse y atender mejor a las clientas.\nClara necesita un pr\u00e9stamo de 1200 soles,  para la compra de sacos de arroz, az\u00facar, leche, fideos.\nEl sue\u00f1o de clara es salir adelante para ayudar a sus hijos a surgir.\n","en":"Clara is a member of the Antares Community Bank.

Because this business went very well for her, she finished building her house and can educate her children.  \r\n\r\nBut, the constant rains last winter caused erosion, which cause landslides that damaged the area where her wood stove was.  Since then she does not make tamales.  She chose to sell \u201cbu\u00f1uelos\u201d (fritters).  She charges one PEN per portion.\r\n\r\nVilma likes her work.

Vilma  brightens up her sales with her good character, which has allowed her to get many customers.  In three months she was able to make her business very profitable.  With these earnings she hopes to return to the space she had set up to sell tamales.

Her story is typical of her fellow group members' experiences with Kiva and Esperanza.\r\n\r\nToday, Elena is looking to take out her second Kiva loan to grow her clothing and food retail business. She currently sells clothing, bananas, habichuela (a staple Dominican bean dish) and vegetables, but she would like to diversify her merchandise to offer earrings as well. Although she has been running her own business for at least the past five years, Elena only became a client of Kiva and Esperanza six months ago, after her mother had success as a borrower of microloans. Since becoming a Kiva and Esperanza client, Elena reports that both her business and her life have changed significantly for the better. Elena has already been able to grow her business so that her second loan is twice the amount of her first. This additional access to capital is especially important to Elena because, although she has no dependents, she lives on her own and supports herself entirely through her independent retail outlet.\r\n\r\nWith her new loan, Elena hopes to expand her merchandise offerings and to have further success with her in-home business.

She is a widow and has four children who live comfortably in her own house. \r\n\r\nShe is the owner of several cultivable fields where she plants (with the help of her children and laborers) bananas, pineapples, and mostly coffee. In addition, each week she works buying and selling fruit. For that she goes to the farms where she has more than 20 farmers who supply her with various fruits at very good prices. In this way she is able to resell at prices accessible to her street vendor companions. \r\n\r\nOver time she has earned many clients. Her customers know her as Camicha and she is very happy with her business since she feels she is a useful mother who can finance the education of her children, with hopes they can achieve their goal of becoming professionals. \r\n\r\nThis is her fifth credit with MFP, demonstrating punctuality with each of her repayments.

If she finds pests, she fumigates the leaves until they have grown and flowered in a uniform way so she can then relocate them.  Mercedes likes to work on her plot of land and is proud of it for producing well. Thanks to its production, they have been able to build a house and are now putting on the final additions so they can live comfortably with their children. \r\n\r\nThis is her tenth loan with MFP.  She has proven herself punctual with her payments on her former loans.  In addition, she has been the treasurer for her communal bank for the past five cycles.  She is very efficient and her fellow members want her to continue being treasurer.  With the money she is asking for, she will buy a bag of seeds for a specific type of seed the will produce a bigger pea.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Shelly Hubman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":343454,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Compra de semilla de arverja","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-06-26T21:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mercedes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":600,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":200,"local_amount":600,"processed_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:55:56Z","rounded_local_amount":609,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842378,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-06-26T23:52:32Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T13:55:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":118432,"name":"Maria Celia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Mar\u00eda Cecilia, pertenece al Banco Comunal \u201cEl Tiempo es Oro\u201d, Distrito de Juanjui, Provincia de Mariscal C\u00e1ceres, Departamento de San Mart\u00edn.

She lives with the father of her 4 children in a house they own, a house constructed of wood and covered on the inside by plastic to keep out the cold night air.  She used to help her parents with farm work as a young girl and what she most liked was growing plantains because they don't require a lot of effort and they can be harvested twice a year.  She used to pick and box the plantains on Fridays so they could be transported easily and, on Saturdays, she took them to the market to sell.  The earnings from this work allowed her to pay for her children's schooling.  Two years ago, though, she decided to spend the majority of her time buying and selling fruit.  Since then, she's bought her merchandise directly from local farmers, something that's allowed her to earn more even though she has to pay transportation costs.  Teodora is very happy with her business.  She now has many more customers, her business generates more revenue and she's been able to improve her quality of life.  This is her third MFP loan.

Rose is an honest and hardworking married lady who has a poultry farm and sells clothes in Mubende Town council. She is 38 years old and a mother of two children. One of her children is in University while the other is in Primary 7. She also cares for two dependants.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>IMON's History<\/p>\r\n<p>Since December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Komi is counting on this opportunity to improve his family\u2019s living conditions.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Carolyn McCaffrey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":343554,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","use":"Purchase a new motorcycle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TG","country":"Togo","town":"Wome","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.85 0.566667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":99,"posted_date":"2009-06-27T00:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Komi ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":350000,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":31964.28},{"due_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":32603.57},{"due_date":"2009-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":33255.64},{"due_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":33920.75},{"due_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":34599.16},{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":35291.15},{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":35996.97},{"due_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":36716.91},{"due_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":37451.25},{"due_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":38200.32}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.49},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.86},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.26},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.69},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.14},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.62},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.14},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.68},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.25},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":68.49,"local_amount":31964.28,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:22:57Z","rounded_local_amount":32228.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52952562,"comment":null},{"amount":69.86,"local_amount":32603.57,"processed_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T13:24:27Z","rounded_local_amount":32872.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63169851,"comment":null},{"amount":71.26,"local_amount":33255.64,"processed_date":"2009-08-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-21T08:54:47Z","rounded_local_amount":33530.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73595442,"comment":null},{"amount":72.69,"local_amount":33920.75,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T16:40:05Z","rounded_local_amount":34200.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87030982,"comment":null},{"amount":74.14,"local_amount":34599.16,"processed_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T20:02:10Z","rounded_local_amount":34884.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96943341,"comment":null},{"amount":75.62,"local_amount":35291.15,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:21:46Z","rounded_local_amount":35582.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103785373,"comment":null},{"amount":77.14,"local_amount":35996.97,"processed_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:01:35Z","rounded_local_amount":36294.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110675807,"comment":null},{"amount":78.68,"local_amount":36716.91,"processed_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:23:30Z","rounded_local_amount":37020.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118070573,"comment":null},{"amount":80.25,"local_amount":37451.25,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:56:44Z","rounded_local_amount":37760.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123906309,"comment":null},{"amount":81.87,"local_amount":38200.32,"processed_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:52:14Z","rounded_local_amount":38515.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128941669,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-06-27T08:19:22Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T08:52:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":118467,"name":"Dilorom","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p>Dilorom has a small business selling clothing.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>IMON's History<\/p>\r\n<p>Since December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

He is 53 years old and lives with his adopted son in the peaceful village of Binarzang, Quirino, Isabela. \r\n\r\nSerapio claims that his adopted child is his main source of inspiration to work harder and become progressive in his business since his three children already have their own families and live separately and far from him.\r\n\r\nAccording to Serapio, his previous loan has been of big help, not only in maintaining his hog-raising business, but also in providing for their daily needs and the allowances of his adopted son. Serapio hopes that his business will survive and continuously be maintained so that he is able to have a sustainable source of

She is again requesting financial support to further sustain the growth of her business. She wanted to borrow at least PHP 4,000.00.

L. is a 35 year old married woman who is the mother of two daughters aged 10 and 15. Both her daughters are attending a local elementary school. Her family lives in Uvurhangay, one of the Mongolian central provinces.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2005, she started running a retail business selling food products at the local market. She has been renting a stall and purchases a variety of food products such as bread, cookies and candies from Ulaanbaatar, the capital city.

A temprana edad quedo hu\u00e9rfana de madre, era la mayor de 4 hermanos por lo que se hizo responsable de ellos, trabajando en la chacra de sus vecinos quienes le pagaban en productos (papa y ma\u00edz) que los compart\u00eda con sus hermanos. En vista de que le faltaba dinero se propuso criar cerdos y luego vend\u00eda la carne a sus vecinos. Al pasar los a\u00f1os, a base de mucho trabajo, compr\u00f3 sus propias tierras agr\u00edcolas, en ellas sembr\u00f3 papas y arvejas, algunas veces le result\u00f3 muy rentable, como tambi\u00e9n tuvo p\u00e9rdidas, pero jam\u00e1s desisti\u00f3 en su trabajo.

Espirita atiende su bodega mientras va conversando con sus clientes y brind\u00e1ndole un buen trato, puesto que valora la preferencia que le tienen, lo que le permite acumular dinero para cubrir la educaci\u00f3n superior de su hijo mayor, con los anhelos de que sea un buen profesional.

Este es su cuarto cr\u00e9dito con MFP, durante los ciclos pasados demostr\u00f3 puntualidad en cada una de sus cuotas. En una oportunidad en que a su hermano le faltaba dinero para cubrir sus cuentas (ambos pertenecen al mismo banco comunal) ella pag\u00f3 la diferencia, lo que muestra que a\u00fan sigue pendiente de sus hermanos menores. El dinero que ahora viene solicitado es para la compra de fertilizantes para sus cultivos y en mayor parte para adquirir cuadernos y papales para su mini librer\u00eda. ","en":"Espirita is 52.  She is a very hard working woman, and she is a single mother.  She lives in her own house with her 18 year old son and her 11 year old daughter.  They are the motivation for her efforts.\r\n\r\nAt an early age she was left as an orphan without a mother.  She was the oldest of four siblings, so she became responsible for them.  She worked on the neighbor\u2019s farm, and they paid her in products (potato and corn), which she shared with her siblings.\r\n\r\nIn light of the fact that she did not have money, she set out to raise pigs.  She later sold the meat to her neighbors.  As the years passed, and after much work, she bought her own fields to cultivate.  She planted potatoes and peas.  Sometimes it was very profitable.  There were also losses.  But, she never stopped worked.  That was how she was able to build her house and set up a store in it.  As of nine months ago, she also has a small bookstore, which her daughter takes care of in her free time.\r\n\r\nEspirita takes care of her store while she chats with her customers.  She treats them well, and she appreciates them.  This allows her to accumulate money to cover her son\u2019s high school expenses.  The goal is for him to be a professional.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Espirita will continue working until she finishes educating her young daughter, who she also loves very much.\r\n\r\nThis is her fourth loan with MFP.  During the past loan cycles she has demonstrated punctuality in all of her payments.

M., and Mar\u00eda Dionisia Gal\u00e1n P\u00e9rez.\r\n\r\nLinda Urania is the group\u2019s coordinator.  She makes a living selling foods such as fried snacks, soft drinks, and cajetas (caramels).  She has a son who is in school.  Linda Urania has worked in this activity for three years.  She is going to invest her portion of the loan in the purchase of food ingredients such as vegetables, fruits, meat, corn, and sugar, which she will process into the prepared foods that she offers to her customers at the Masaya bus stop.  Linda Urania is married.  Her husband has worked as a carpenter for a very long time and helps her with the household expenses.  Linda Urania likes having her business because it provides her with her own income and thus allows her to purchase things she likes such as clothing, shoes, and household items.  She was selected as the group\u2019s coordinator because her business is close to the ADIM agency and she can therefore make the payments on time.\r\n\r\nAnother member of the group is Mar\u00eda Milagros, who makes a living selling pastries, coffee, sandwiches, and trout.  She has been involved in this activity for many years.  She sells her foods as a street vendor in the market.  Her business has grown, and she used a loan to purchase milk, sugar, breads, enchiladas, etc.  She offers these products to her customers in the mornings.  Her work schedule runs from the early hours of dawn until two in the afternoon.  She hopes she can offer her customers other kinds of food. \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Dionisia Gal\u00e1n makes a living selling pastries and beverages from her home, and in the mornings sells her foods in the local market.  She used a loan to purchase higher-quality pastries and fruits for making beverages.  Mar\u00eda Dionisa is well known for selling these projects.  She is single and works by herself, and thus has enough money for medicine when she becomes ill.  Her dream is to improve part of her small house.  \r\n\r\nThe group hopes to always be punctual, and this has given them much satisfaction and the opportunity to work.  \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Christopher Knutson, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":343809,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchasing supplies for preparing meals","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Masaya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.966667 -86.1","type":"point"}},"partner_id":120,"posted_date":"2009-06-27T06:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Linda Urania","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Milagros","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Dionisia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":7200,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2009-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2009-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2009-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":283.58,"local_amount":5444.64,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T16:20:13Z","rounded_local_amount":5604.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52889262,"comment":null},{"amount":28.92,"local_amount":555.36,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T09:34:23Z","rounded_local_amount":571.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73532025,"comment":null},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":600,"processed_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T09:38:39Z","rounded_local_amount":617.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86963519,"comment":null},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":600,"processed_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T09:39:12Z","rounded_local_amount":617.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86963520,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-06-27T09:57:48Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T09:39:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":118591,"name":"Fidencio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Fidencio tiene 49 a\u00f1os, es un hombre noble y trabajador, est\u00e1 separado y tiene 3 hijos que viven con su ex pareja; \u00e9l vive al cuidado de su madre en su casa propia.

But, he did not renounce his responsibility as a father.\r\n\r\nFidencio put more effort into his crops, increasing his fields until he had four hectares of potatoes, three of peas, and a smaller amount of corn.  During the harvests he had difficulty preparing refreshments for his workers, but now he has decided to pay them more and avoid that worry.  Fidencio really loves his farm; he loves it more when the crops bear fruit.  Thanks to his fields and his work, he sells his products at the wholesale market in the city of Tarma.  With his earnings, he can cover the educational costs of his children.  Even though they are far away, he does not want them to do without.\r\n\r\nThis is his fourth loan with MFP.

When he came of age (18-years old) he realized he had to work hard on his father's farm to help improve his family's financial situation, considering that they don't have money to cover his younger brothers' schooling. Since then, Roly gets up very early so that by 8:00 a.m. he is already working his crops. \r\n\r\nDuring the summer he starts turning over the soil and preparing it for next season's planting. It is now time to plow the furrows where he will plant potatoes. Roly accomplishes this work with the valuable help of his father, but during the harvest his mother and sisters join him to work on the land, picking the potatoes and sorting them by size to send to the market in Tarma city.\r\n\r\nThis harvest turned out very profitable, since he sold each sack of potatoes at 70 to 80 PEN. He put the money towards meeting the needs of his sisters, also setting aside a portion for the next planting season. Roly is happy with his work; he loves his crops and feels useful in his home.

She has always characterized herself as being a very charismatic and cordial woman, which is the secret to her business. She is dedicated to selling wallets, purses, caps, and other accessories in the market of the district of Puente Piedra in the city of Lima.\r\n<p>\r\nHer job gives her lots of pleasure, because she can make recommendations to her clients about what goes well with them, and it keeps her busy through the long day. Although she has four years experience in this work, which makes her able to do her job, we cannot say that it is easy, because she dedicates practically her whole day to it. Karina works from eight in the morning until nine at night on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, since on Tuesdays and Thursdays she does her job at a market closer to her home.\r\n<p>\r\nIn the future she would like to have her own clothing store exclusively for kids, because she loves kids a lot. Furthermore, she thinks that this market will be more profitable, because there is more variety in colors and designs and she wouldn't have competition because there are no stores in her area dedicated to this market. This is her first individual loan with Microfinanzas PRISMA, having previous experience in community banks, but due to lack of time to attend group meetings, she has opted for this choice. With the money that she is requesting, she will buy more novel wallets and purses to increase her sales and come closer to realizing her dreams.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jay

Her work schedule is from very early in the morning until three in the afternoon when she goes home. She hopes to grow her business in order to achieve her goals of improving her home. \n\nCandida Rosa L\u00f3pez sells fruits and vegetables in the municipal market of Mayasa. She has many years' experience in this business, which she learned from her mother. From the very early hours of the morning, she purchases her products from the trucks that arrive with vegetables from the northern zone of the country and later in the day, she resells these products. She has two adolescent children and they help her with her sales. Her husband works for himself and he helps with the expenses of the home. Her loan she will use to purchase a wider variety of fruits and thus increase her sales. \n\nJuana Antonia, just like her fellow group members, sells fruits and vegetable in the market in Masaya. She is the coordinator of the group, as she is very responsible and she has the respect of the whole community. She has children, but they are independent.  She dreams of improving her home and always being able to support herself. She will invest in the purchase of more perishable products and this way vary the products she will sell. Her husband helps with the expenses of the home. He works in the transportation business for the market. \n\nThe group members tell us that Adim has taught them to better control and improve their businesses with the training they have received, and that they have helped them in their personal lives as well. They propose to work with Adim for several cycles and are clear that this will be the case only if they can be disciplined in their repayments. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michelle

Recently, she has worked very hard in order to earn the necessary income for the construction of her own home, which is still in progress. She hopes that it will be finished soon so that she can have security and comfort. Right now she lives in the home of her mother-in-law.<p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn the time that she has been married, she has learned the business of her spouse, and now has a support role in his business, a role where she is in charge of the administration of the contracts. They rent scaffolding (metal supports) which are required for construction. In the same way, the business, which they have with their children in the city market, serves the requests for the creation or repair of diverse construction materials. This venture began 3 years ago, during which, along with her spouse and children, Betty works in the shop from 9 in the morning until 6 in the evening. Betty says that in the company of her family, the work seems less tedious. Together they plan to grow their business so that they can provide better services in the field of construction. <p>\r\n<p>\r\nThis is her 18th loan with Microfinanzas PRISMA, and as part of her community bank, Betty tries to support all of her fellow members to help them develop and grow.

MCA Primary school is the only school in Massegbeh village. The school was established in 2004 by the Missionary Church of Africa. Currently, it has ten staff and a total of 182 pupils. \r\n\r\nThese teachers, like many of their counterparts in Magburaka and other parts of the country, have applied for a loan from SMT\/Kiva in order to invest in something meaningful. And gradually, out of their monthly salaries, their school bursar repays SMT on a monthly basis on behalf of the teachers.\r\n\r\nAs teachers\u2019 salaries are usually small in Sierra Leone, needless to say that SMT\/Kiva loans are of a great importance to these teachers. Some of them will use this loan to either purchase a piece of land in order to build a house, or complete a house building project they have started. Some will use theirs to buy pieces of furniture, like a bed, chairs etc.  Some will use theirs to pay school fees either for themselves pursue further studies or for their children. While others will use theirs to invest in businesses in order to supplement their meager monthly salaries.\r\n\r\nAbdul K. (back row second from left) is the head master at the school. Abdul is 47 years of age. He was born in Yoni village, about 40 miles from Massesebeh village. He is married to a businesswoman and they have four children.

One of the things she was able to offer them, apart from her love and attention, is a house of their own where they can live like a happy family. When she began selling things to earn money, she didn't have the purchasing power to do much, but she had a lot of faith that things would get better -- and they did. She went from being a street vendor to having her own space. She stopped going to the local market and set up in a pleasant space where she can sell her products in peace and increase her sales. Now she is convinced that every sacrifice is repaid and because of that wishes to continue working every day from 9 in the morning to 8 at night, happily tending her shop. Maria is assisted by her daughter, who watches the shop while Maria prepares food in the morning. That's how she's been able to continue selling toys for more than 10 years. A sense of comradeship and a desire to improve one's life are two of the qualities she likes about her communal bank, since the members have given her a lot of support for her social and economic development with the 18 previous loans she's gotten from Microfinanzas PRISMA.

We also expect to process peanuts into peanut butter that we will put in buckets to sell right where we live and also in surrounding villages. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa
