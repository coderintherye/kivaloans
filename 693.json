is Nimfa, a 41-year-old resident of Tanza, Cavite City, Philippines. As a single person, she manages her household while operating a business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nNimfa operates a junk shop. Trash is not actively segregated in the Philippines, and while waiting for their local dump trucks, people scavenge garbage dumps and trash bags for recyclable materials like metal, copper, plastic, paper and other materials. They sell these to junk shops like Nimfa's for a little profit. Junk shops then stack, clean, and gather huge quantities of these materials and sell them back to foundries like factories and others of the like. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 2250 Philippines pesos (Php) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 8,000 loan. She will be incorporating the loan on her current revolving funds used to buy recyclable materials from collectors. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nNimfa hopes her business grows more in the coming years.

is Nilo, 41, resident of Silang, Cavite, Philippines. A father of  two children, Nilo has managed by the grace of God to support his children's schooling.  He is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nNilo oversees operations of their jeepney (see footnote) transportation business. They have one unit (14-16 person capacity) jeepney, which is paying boundary (daily quota) each day. His regular customers are his neighbors and the local community. He earns a minimum of Php 1,000 every day.\r\n\r\nTo help him continue operations of his business, he is requesting a Php 12,000 loan. He will be utilizing the loan to buy new accessories, spare parts and maintenance of his jeepney. He expects a boost in his business income as he expands his business.\r\n\r\nNilo dreams that his children will finish their education. He faithfully meets up with his co-fellowship members* to share stories of his work every week and where he can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God he studies.\r\n\r\n-Curiously, Jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain.

She is married to Govanie, a tricycle driver, and the mother of six children. Two of the children are in college, two are in high school, and two are in elementary school. Medy shares the responsibilities of wife, mother and businesswoman. \r\n\r\nMedy owns a junk shop that purchases scrap materials, plastics, bottles, steel, paper, and other recyclable materials. There are junk shop boys who do the routine rounds in their community to buy scrap items from neighborhood. Other people do the selling directly in her junk shop. She purchases plastic items by the kilogram, as well as paper, bronze and steel. Other items, like bottles, are bought per piece. She also sells these scrap items back to their manufacturers. From her business alone, she earns 200 PHP per day. \r\n\r\nMedy is requesting a loan of PHP 14,000 that will help as additional capital. She will spend it to purchase scrap items being sold in the junk shop. The loan will definitely help her to have a better profit, the more amount invested, the better the profit. \r\n\r\nMedy dreams that her business will become bigger. She wants to have more carts that will be used by her helpers. Having a junk shop is her way of helping the community understand the value of trash. She believes that people just need to know how to recycle items that they believe to be worthless.

He buys groceries like canned goods, condiments, milk, sugar, and primary commodities that are needed in every household. He earns money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. His store is located adjacent to his house. His regular customers are neighbors and the local community. He earns a minimum of 1,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nHe is requesting a loan amounting to 10,000 PHP that will help keep his business running well. He will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand his product inventory. It will also help him to attract more customers to buy household needs. His profits from the business will definitely help him to cover his daily needs.\r\n\r\nInocencio dreams that his variety store will grow bigger and be sustainable. He wants all his children to finish their studies and have a good life once they settle down. He believes that education is the best gift that they can give to them, and it will be their armor to combat life. The fellowship* every week never fails to inspire him to grow more spiritually, and it helps him to be a better father to his children. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":896730,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to pay for grocery items and products needed in his business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Commonwealth, Quezon City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-10-22T15:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Inocencio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":3333,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:37:41Z","rounded_local_amount":3602.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238571875,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2667.03,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:31:46Z","rounded_local_amount":2882.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244529425,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2666.97,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:39:21Z","rounded_local_amount":2882.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250738641,"comment":null},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":1333,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:48:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1440.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257145869,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-10-22T16:21:58Z","paid_date":"2012-02-15T09:48:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":347328,"name":"Nareman","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nareman is a 32-year-old young woman.

Nareman wants to help her husband pay for insuring and licensing the taxi, but the amount of money she has isn't enough to pay, so she needs to take out a loan of $1,200 from FATEN. When Nareman gets the loan, which will be repaid on a monthly basis, she will be able to help her husband pay the expense of insuring and licensing the taxi.

She and Benjamine share the responsibility in attending to their young children while at the same time earning an income to provide for their daily needs. \r\n\r\nDarlyn is a Balut vendor. In the Philippines, Balut is well-known egg snack that is sold on the sidewalk. It is a duck egg boiled with a delicious small amount of soup inside. It is highly nutritious food that Filipinos love to eat, especially when they feel tired, as it revitalizes energy and strength. About 450 to 600 Balut eggs are boiled and sold every night. She and her husband not only prepare these eggs but also do the selling, which means they do not need to pay commissions to vendors to sell the eggs. They earn 300 Philippine Pesos (PhP) in sales per day.  \r\n\r\nDarlyn is requesting a loan amounting to Php 10,000 that she will use as start-up capital for her additional business, which will involve selling fried chicken skin and quail eggs. There is a high demand for fried chicken skin and Darlyn wants to give it a try since her stall is located in a crowded and busy area. The remaining amount will be spent on purchasing additional Balut eggs.\r\n\r\nDarlyn dreams of having a stall located in the market. She still has to wait a little longer to make this dream come true because she needs to prioritize being a mother to her young children. For now, Darlyn and her husband will continue to depend on to each other to make their small business grow for the sake of their children\u2019s future. \r\n\r\nDarlyn never fails to attend weekly fellowship* as it inspires her to go on with her life no matter what the obstacles might be, because she has faith in a God Who she believes will never fail her. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":896776,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Balut-Making","sector":"Food","use":"to buy additional stocks of Balut and to add new food items to her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Commonwealth, Quezon City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-10-22T16:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Darlyn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2667,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:37:18Z","rounded_local_amount":2882.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238571877,"comment":null},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":2666,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:31:57Z","rounded_local_amount":2881.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244529427,"comment":null},{"amount":83.34,"local_amount":3334,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:39:35Z","rounded_local_amount":3603.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250738643,"comment":null},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":1333,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:48:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1440.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257145871,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-10-22T19:06:35Z","paid_date":"2012-02-15T09:48:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":347378,"name":"Reuben","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Reuben is 28 years old, married, and supports a family of six which includes his children (ages seven and four years old), his wife, and some family members.

The loan will be used to purchase more of a traditional food called pocho, since famine has been rampant and pocho is now in high demand. This will help Susan generate greater profits and pay for her children's school fees and other family bills. Susan hopes that in the future she will be able to finish building her new home. \r\n\r\nSusan is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).

She buys raw materials like textiles, buttons, thread, etc. She cuts and sews these into different patterns, depending upon the job order from her clients. There are round neck, v-neck, polo shirts and sometimes office and school uniforms. She caters to the needs of her clients and provides them a satisfaction guaranteed kind of service to have them repeat orders from her. Her business allows her to earn 700 Philippine Pesos (PHP) per day. \r\n\r\nJosephine is requesting a loan amounting to 11,000 PHP that will help as  additional capital. She will spend it to buy additional products she needs in her business. She will prioritize her purchases of the materials that she needs right now for her current order which is for polo shirts. She makes sure that the order is delivered on time as it will add additional points in her negotiations. \"Meeting my clients demand, satisfaction guaranteed will definitely mean additional customers because they will refer me to other companies who need garments,\" she says.\r\n\r\nJosephine dreams of having a more visible shop. Her business location right now is quite far from the highway, there are times when her clients have a hard time finding residence. She is praying to God that one day, she will be able to have enough income that will sustain her to maintain a shop in a more visible area. She never fails to attend the weekly fellowship* as it inspires her to be a more God-fearing and God-loving individual.

Jehan wants to make some repairs to her house such as changing windows and doors, and purchase some new furniture. Jehan doesn't have enough money to pay, so she needs to take out a loan of $2,000 from FATEN.

Ishaq wants to purchase new home furniture such as bedroom furniture and living room furniture to replace the old one in order to improve his family living conditions. However, the amount of money he has isn't enough to pay for this purchase, so he needs to take out a loan in the amount of $2,000 from FATEN.

1964 in the Geghanush village of the Kapan region, graduated from the village secondary school and then graduated from the Kapan professional college as a radio technician.  He is married and has an eighteen-year-old son and two daughters.  His twenty-year-old daughter attends a fourth year of the Kapan agricultural institute, and Sarik's oldest daughter got married and lives separately.  Sarik's wife helps him with the household.  Sarik works in the security service of the Kapan Mining and Processing Plant.  He found it difficult to support his family solely on his salary, which is not high, and decided to become involved in an agricultural business in his native Geghanush village in 1998.  He owns cattle, chickens, bees and land, where he grows vegetables and fruits.  Sarik has loyal customers in Kapan, who purchase vegetables and fruits grown by him and also buy beef, pork, honey, eggs and milk.  The profit from the sales of agricultural products helps him to support his family and pay for his daughter's education.  Sarik needs a loan in the sum of 500,000 dram to buy beehive boxes and also to buy hay in order to improve honey production and provide livestock with fodder for the winter.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":265.65,"image":{"id":896973,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To

is a 50-year-old man who is always cheerful in his everyday life, according to the residents of his neighborhood. It is in this neighborhood where he got married and where his first child was born. Adel is the father of 11 children. The burden is becoming heavier than ever, as he needs to cover his children's expenses in terms of living, education, and other things required by the big family.\r\n\r\nAdel started his business long ago in order to cover the big expenses imposed by his big family. His business was initially a cafe shop that didn't require a large amount of capital except to purchase kilos of sugar and tea. This business achieved a good reputation in old Sana'a, where it is located, and many people became regulars. Adel's family life was somewhat improved by the limited income of that cafe, but Adel did not stop at this point. He had some thoughts about further enlarging his business by opening another shop next to the cafe for selling cabab, which is a publicly sold food eaten as breakfast.\r\n\r\nAdel was in need of a loan to start the other business and visited one of Al-Amal Bank's branches. He received three loans sequentially and this had a good impact on his business and family. Adel took the fourth loan of 180,000 YER from Al-Amal in order to pay the rent of the two shops and purchase needed materials like tea, sugar, new dishes, and tables for the cabab shop.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Adel hopes to expand his business by opening a restaurant selling all types of food, not only cabab. He also hopes to build a house for his family and children.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":340.14,"image":{"id":896996,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

This form of work allows her to generate resources to support her family in any way possible, since she is married and has eight children.\r\n \r\nWhen you ask her what she likes about Pro Mujer, she responds that she likes the savings.\r\n\r\nTwo members, Ana and Irene, are not in the photograph, since they had medical appointments.\r\n"}},"status":"deleted","funded_amount":1775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":897022,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Knitting","sector":"Arts","use":"to buy vicu\u00f1a wool.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz  \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1775,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lucia\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Viviana Barbara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Laura\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Virginia\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irene\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Elizabeth\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anastasia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Monica\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":12222.21,"loan_amount":1775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2037.12},{"due_date":"2011-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":2037.12},{"due_date":"2011-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":2037.12},{"due_date":"2012-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":2037.12},{"due_date":"2012-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":2037.12},{"due_date":"2012-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2036.61}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":295.85},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":295.84},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":295.85},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":295.84},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":295.85},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":295.77}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":347553,"name":"Mercy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mercy used her first loan to buy fertilizers, seedlings and also labor for her farm.

She lives in this town with her husband and three children almost all of her life. Nataliya started her business so she could somehow feed her family because at that time she and her husband were working on the factory which collapsed. The savings which they were able to have before were used to buy some merchandise and started to sell. They started from selling men's and women's underwear and with time switched to shoes. At this time Nataliya sells women's shoes on the central market of the town. She offers a small surcharge on quality shoes which she buys directly from the factory without middlemen. Nataliya has been selling this type of merchandise for fifteen years already. Her clean monthly profit is over 5,000 hryvna.\r\n\r\nNataliya has bought out her vendor space a long time ago and works directly with the factory. At this time she plans to invest the loan money in the amount of 15,000 hryvna to buy winter shoes for sale during this season. Although Nataliya was faced with all kinds of difficulties (her shoes were stolen from the wholesale storage, and for a long time she did not have her own vendor space) she did not give up and continued to bravely move forward with faith in the success of her own business.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":937.5,"image":{"id":897184,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to invest the loan money in the amount of 15,000 hryvna to buy winter shoes for sale this season.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UA","country":"Ukraine","town":"Belaya Tserkov","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"49.783333 30.116667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":26,"posted_date":"2011-10-17T19:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nataliya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UAH","disbursal_amount":15000,"loan_amount":1875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2011-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2012-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2012-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2012-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2012-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2012-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2012-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1875}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":234.38},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":234.37},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":234.38},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":234.37},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":234.38},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":234.37},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":234.38},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":234.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":234.38,"local_amount":1875,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:15:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1876.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244597095,"comment":null},{"amount":234.37,"local_amount":1875,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:26:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1876.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250811081,"comment":null},{"amount":234.38,"local_amount":1875,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:45:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1876.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257219806,"comment":null},{"amount":234.37,"local_amount":1875,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:57:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1876.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263357843,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-11-18T16:15:36Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":347617,"name":"Olga Cristina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Do\u00f1a Olga, mantiene su negocio en venta de ropa de segunda mano, venta de cosmeticos Avon, el cual ha introducido como producto nuevo, para ayudarse mas con los gastos, su esposo labora como alba\u00f1il, apoyando  a sus dos hijos, con la educacion, y moral, para un bienestar comun de la familia.\nOlga, comprara dos pacas surtida y productos Avon, el cual trabaja por catalogo y pedidos de sus nuevos clientes, matiene productos por que quiere crecer, para fortalecer su negocio, ya que cuando su esposo no labora en la construccion, todos se apoyan.
