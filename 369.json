T. is from the village of Capihan, Tacangon, Mahinog, Camiguin Province. She is 36 years old. Lourdes is widowed and has five school-aged children. To make a living, Lourdes owns and operates a specialized retail business. While not the only means of generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling firewood in the local community. Lourdes has been engaged in this business for over four years and earns approximately 1,500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2010, Lourdes joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Lourdes is requesting a loan of 5000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be her first loan from HSPFI.

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marissa B. is from the village of Sonquil, Sta. Barbara, Pangasinan. She is 35 years old and is the group leader of an 8-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Marissa B. Group.\r\n\r\nMarissa is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Marissa owns and operates a business venture in the food sector, operating a butcher shop in the market. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from butchering and selling a variety of meats in the market. Marissa has been engaged in her business for over 1 year and earns approximately 6000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Marissa joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Marissa has successfully repaid a previous loan of 15000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Marissa is now requesting a new loan of 20000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and working capital. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Marissa from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas.

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fatima A. is from the village of Manano, Mallig, Isabela. She is 37 years old and is the group leader of a 9-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Fatima A.'s Group.\r\n\r\nFatima is married and has 4 school-aged children. To make a living, Fatima owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for fattening and for sale. Fatima has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 3000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Fatima joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Fatima has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future. Fatima has now requested a new loan of 8000 PHP which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Fatima from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is 58 years old. Floria is the group leader of a 10-member group. While each member of the group receives an individual loan through ASKI, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is the Floria B. Group.\r\n\r\nFloria is married and has two adult children. To earn a living, Floria owns and operates a general store. While not the only means of generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Floria has been engaged in her business for over 30 years and earns approximately 2,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Floria joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business. Floria has successfully repaid a previous loan of 25,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Floria is requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand product offering. This  will be the eleventh loan taken out by Floria through ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue it generates to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva and edited by a human editor.

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Li-an D. is from the village of Manano. She is 34 years old. Li-an is the group leader of a 10-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Li-an Diampo's Group.\r\n\r\nLi-an is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Li-an owns & operates a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap & toothpaste in the local community. Li-an has been engaged in her business for over 2 years and earns approximately 4,500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Li-an joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Li-an has successfully repaid a previous loan of 25,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Li-an is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product selection. This will be the seventh loan taken out by Li-an from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she has been able to borrow quite a few times from CCT\u2019s Cooperative, using the money to expand and improve her variety store.  Now with your help, she would like to apply for a PHP 27,000 loan. This amount will be used as a source of added capital in her expanding business to buy groceries to replenish her current product inventory and continue operations of her variety store.   <p>\r\n\r\nEdith dreams that her business will continue to grow so that she can provide a comfortable home for her children. She also works hard for her children\u2019s education.<p>\r\n\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay micro finance

R., 39, is making sure that her family has enough provisions for their daily needs. Married to Ricardo R., a driver, they are blessed with three children. She makes sure that she helps her husband earn money so that their family can have a better life.  She has been juggling three businesses in the past five years. She does direct selling for the country\u2019s popular cosmetics and clothing brands, she has her own electronic cellular phone loading station, and a buy-and-sell business.\r\n\r\nLuisa has been a regular member of Center for Community Transformation* (CCT) for more than a year now. She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she has been able to borrow quite a few times in CCT\u2019s Cooperative.  She is consistent in paying her dues because she used the money she borrowed to expand and improve her businesses.     \r\n\r\nNow with your help, she would like to apply for a 26,000 Philippine peso loan. This amount will be used as a source of added capital to her expanding business by buying more products to be incorporated into her inventory.\r\n\r\nShe dreams that her business will continue to grow so that she can provide for her children\u2019s education. She also envisions herself having her own house.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":507161,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products

Jangad Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Noli J. is from the village of New Look, Plaridel, Misamis Occidental. He is 29 years old. Noli is the group leader of a 3-member group loan offered by PMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nNoli is single. To make a living, Noli owns & operates a business venture making & selling snacks & other delicacies in the local community. Noli has been engaged in this business for over 3 years and earns approximately 1000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, Noli joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Noli has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. Noli is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the 7th loan taken out by Noli from PMPC. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of the borrower's family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":506492,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

He is 44 years old. Reynaldo is the group leader of a seven member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nReynaldo is married and has two school-age children. To make a living, Reynaldo and his wife own a business selling cosmetics and daily use products such as perfumes, talc powder, and make-up in the local community. Reynaldo is just starting this business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Reynaldo joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Reynaldo is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand his product offering. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Reynaldo from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated to expand his business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":507165,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics

E. is from the village of Obay, Polanco, Zamboanga del Norte. She is 45 years old, married, and has 2 school-aged children. To make a living, Litas owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector running a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Litas has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 8,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Litas joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Litas has successfully repaid a previous loan of 14,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory & working capital. Litas is requesting a new loan of 14,900 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand her store's product offering. This loan will be the 4th loan taken out by Litas from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of the borrower's children. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

She is consistent in paying her dues because she used the money she borrowed to expand and improve her variety store.     \r\n\r\nNow with your help, she would like to apply for a PHP 12,000 loan. This amount will be used as a source of added capital to her expanding business by buying groceries needed to replenish stocks and continue operation of her variety store.\r\n\r\nShe dreams that her business will continue to grow and be successful.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nImelda is married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Imelda and her husband own & operate a business providing electronics repairs in the local community. Imelda has been engaged in her business for over 25 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Imelda joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Imelda is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase materials needed to expand the services provided. This loan will be the seventh loan taken out by Imelda from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Maricel is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings, and young crops to raise. This loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by Maricel from PMPC.

M., 59, is making sure that her family has enough for their daily needs. Married to Faustino, a carpenter, she is blessed with two children. She makes sure that she helps her husband earn so that their family can have a better life.  She has been managing her own variety store while maintaining a cooked food stall which usually offers breakfast fare and viands.\r\n\r\nYolanda has been a regular member of Center for Community Transformation* (CCT) for more than a year now. She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she was able to borrow eleven times through CCT\u2019s Cooperative.  She is consistent in paying her dues because she uses the money she borrows to expand and improve her businesses.     \r\n\r\nNow with your help, she would like to apply for a PHP 12,000 loan.

She is 23 years old. Gladys is the group leader of a 7-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Gladys R.' Group.\r\n<p>\r\nGladys is married and has 2 school-aged children. To make a living, Gladys owns & operates a general store. The main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Gladys has been engaged in her business for over 2 years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2009, Gladys joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Gladys has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Gladys is requesting a new loan of 11,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase new items to expand product offering. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Gladys from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand it. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About ASKI:<\/b><br>\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk, and small entrepreneurs.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She has been managing her own general store for three years now.\r\n<br>Gloria has been a regular member of Kiva partner, Center for Community Transformation (CCT), for more than a year. She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings* and pays her weekly dues consistently. As she has a good repayment record for her previous loans, she was able to borrow eight times more from CCT. She is consistent in paying her dues because she used the money she borrowed to expand and improve her business.     \r\n<br>Now with your help, she would like to apply for a loan of 14,000 PHP. This amount will be used as a source of added capital to her expanding business by buying groceries needed to replenish stocks and continue the operation of her general store. Gloria dreams that her business will continue to grow so that she can provide for her children\u2019s education and give them a bright future.\r\n<p>\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance

This association was founded in 1993 by twenty women entrepreneurs to increase their purchasing power by way of a tontine (a revolving credit system in which each member periodically pays a suitable amount and which funds its various members by turns).  This policy does not allow every member to be financed on the same day.  \r\n\r\nThe members decided to join IMCEC in order to award loans without guarantee requirements.  Thus, the members are divided into sub-groups of five, each with a designated president and a treasurer.  These sub-groups, which currently number as many as 63, can be the same for several years but often change their members according to the financing of needs and other considerations.  \r\n\r\nThe AFDE organizes member meetings each month, when all the sub-groups are invited.  It facilitates cooperation for its members, enabling them to buy rice and other goods at better prices.  The AFDE is lead by a president by the name of Ms. Mame Diarra MAR and by a treasurer, Ms. Ndeye Ndella Diouf , both residents of Thi\u00e8s. \r\n\r\nThe president of AFDE 28 is Ms. Bineta S., aged 46, who is married and the mother of four children.

He lives with his wife and has a five-year-old son who attends preschool. Besides his son, he is also responsible for taking care of his mother. He sends her 1000 Meticales each month for her basic needs. He also manages to save 1000 Meticales each month because his wife helps out financially. Like him, she is a teacher. \r\n\r\nAfter finishing his basic education (through 10th grade), Octavio completed a 3-year teacher training course that prepared him to work as a Portuguese language teacher. The same year he finished, due to the large number of family members living in his parents' house and because he already had a family of his own, he moved into a rental house costing 400 Meticales a month. Later he was transferred to a job in the Direc\u00e7ao Distrital da Educa\u00e7\u00e3o [Regional Education Administration] where he currently works from 7:30 AM to 3:30 PM. He earns 5548 Meticales per month and also has a scholarship that allows him to further his education. Because he was tired of living in a rental house, he approached Hluvuku [the Kiva field partner] for a loan to cover the legal expenses and construction costs of building his own home. Due to the fact that his construction materials were stolen he has not been able to finish the project but he never lost hope that he would be able to build. He decided to ask for another loan in the amount of 20,000 Meticales to finish this construction project and move into his own home.\r\n\r\nThis is Octavio's third loan with Hluvuku and his first with Kiva. His first loan, for 15,000 Meticales, was used to legalize the land he owns. The second, for 8000 Meticales, was to begin the construction. He is asking for this third loan to put the finishing touches on his construction project. He is sure that he will repay this loan on time and will ask for another loan to furnish his house.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Catherine Fountain, Kiva

He is married and is the father of two children, a 9-year-old daughter and a 4-year-old son.  The daughter is in elementary school, and the son is in preschool.  Aside from the children, he is responsible for his mother and a nephew who live with him, and he does not manage to save anything because he is still building his house and cannot count on help from his wife, who is unemployed.\r\n\r\nIsaac completed school but did not attend college for financial reasons.  After a year he got into teaching school, which he completed in two years and was employed in Boane.  Because he was far from home and his family, he asked for a transfer to the town of Namaacha where he now teaches physical education in the mornings and math in the afternoons, earning 5,560 meticais per month.  Six months after the transfer his salary of 35,000 meticais was paid retroactively, and he began building his own house.  Because the price of materials rose, he could not finish the plastering and some parts of his veranda.  He first approached Hluvuku asking for a loan of 12,000 meticais to buy a gas oven and a set of sofas, and he paid it off with no problems.\r\n\r\nThis is Isaac's third loan with Hluvuku and his first with Kiva.  The first loan of 12,000 meticais was used to buy the oven and sofas.  The second loan, for 6,000 meticais, was used to buy construction material, and this third loan of 15,000 meticais will be used for plastering and for finishing the veranda which he must have because of the climate.  He is confident that he will pay the loan off ahead of schedule and ask for a new loan to pay for further education.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Danielle Maxson, Kiva

She is 31 years old and lives with her husband and her 13-year-old daughter, who attends school. She also cares for 2 nephews who live with her in her home. Each month she manages to put 1500 Meticales in savings because she is helped out financially by her husband, who owns a rhyolite mine.\r\n\r\nAdelia moved with her older sister to Vila de Namaacha on the border with Swaziland, thinking that they would go to school there. After they arrived, however, they couldn't enroll in school because of a lack of complete documentation. She then met her husband and moved in with him. Her husband emigrated to South Africa and left her with some funds, which she used to start her own business. She was able to set up a stall in Jermantino, which is 7 kilometers from her town and is very popular because it is located on the main road. After some years, Adelia's husband returned and they decided to buy land on which they could mine rhyolite. He decided to stay in order to take care of his business personally. Adelia has 5 workers to help her, who earn 1500 Meticales per month. However, because of the cost of the mine construction, Adelia is barely able to cover all her expenses and she has asked Hluvuku for a loan in the amount of 8000 Meticales to strengthen her business. Her best products are fish, beans, and drinks. She earns 4000 Meticales each month, and spends 10,000 Meticales each time she travels.\r\n\r\nThis is Adelia's first loan with Hluvuku and Kiva. The 8000 Meticales will be used to buy products for her store. She is confident that she will repay the loan promptly. She will then ask for another loan to acquire more tools for extracting the rhyolite, because the ones she currently has are worn down,\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Catherine

Years later he's transferred to the Naamacha village in the border with Suazilandia, where he's promoted to border patrol officer working from 7am to 3:30pm and making U$350 per month. Jose received a house from the govermnet that he had to share with others, but the atmosphere wasn't catholic, so he rented a house where he's been living with his family for the past 20 years paying U$36 per month. Tired of renting, he asked BIM for a loan to start building his own house, which he paid back on time. The construction wasn't finished though, due to the high costs of the supplies, so Jose asked Hluvuku and Kiva for a loan to finish building the house since he already moved into it. This is Jose's first loan with Hluvuku and Kiva and he's asking for $650 to buy construction supplies. He's confident he'll pay it back sooner than the expected payback date and hopes to get another loan in the future in order to buy furniture.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Mariana

He also earns supplementary income from owning a tailoring shop in his town. Overall, he says that lately the main challenge to his business is low market prices for his produce, which makes life difficult with the high input costs he faces.\r\n\r\nAlphonce has a successful history with Juhudi Kilimo, previously completing two loans of Kes 20,000 and Kes 40,000. He has now requested this loan of Kes 80,000 to expand his poultry farming operations and to purchase a dairy animal. He says that the extra income from this loan will help his family meet their basic needs without much struggle, and allow the children to get the best education.\r\n\r\nAlphonce has plans for expansion in the next five to ten years, and he recognizes the gains he has made since having access to capital in recent years. He now sees himself becoming a big supplier of milk and poultry products to the neighboring areas and to the Kenya Cooperative of Creameries in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":507316,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To

Eight of them are boys and four are girls, the seven older ones are employed and the four younger ones are students. Besides her children she also takes care of a nephew who's an orphan. \r\nAna lost her father while she was still a baby, her mother remarried and left her to be taken care by her older brother, who didn't do a good job so she had to drop school and only finished first grade. When she was 10 years old, she ran away with a friend to Maputo and worked as a maid for five years, moving then to Namaacha in the border with Suazilandia where she got married to her husband who worked for Petromoc. After receiving some money she started raising chicks, activity that she has been performing for the past 10 years. She has between 200 and 300 chicks, and makes a  $250 profit every month. From that money she's able to save between $35 and $60. \r\nShe is asking for a $475 loan to buy used clothes in South Africa to resell. This is her first loan with Huluvuku and Kiva and she's confident she'll be able to pay it back in no time, because besides her two businesses she also has the help of her husband. She dreams of building her own chicken raising farm.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Mariana Dauwe, Kiva

Sergio's mother remarried and lost her life years later, leaving Sergio with the house where he still lives to this day. \r\nSergio has a job at a local bottle company and has been working there full time for the past 4 years, from 7:30pm to 3:30pm and from 3:30pm to 11:30pm, making U$85 per month. \r\nHe was able to get a piece of land but lacks the money to build a house, so he's asking Hluvuku and Kiva for a U$325 loan. After his house is built he plans on giving his old house to his brother. He's confident he'll pay the loan back in no time.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Mariana Dauwe, Kiva

A teacher by profession, Rustambek is also a farmer. Recognized by the people of the neighborhood as a serious man, Rustambek would like to expand his business into a viable source of income. In order to do that, he needs a loan of 10 000 Somoni to buy seeds and fertilizer to expand his crop. With part of the loan, he will buy young cattle. The income from it will help him cope with the needs of his large family.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Her business is to sell various products, notably jerseys, dishes, other clothes and underwear, padlocks, scissors, flashlights, etc. She buys her merchandise in the town of Goma, at the Birere shopping center, and takes her merchandise to sell about 50 km away, in the rural area surrounding Minova. \r\n\r\nBesides this business, she sells tomatoes, manioc flour, maize flour, small dried fish, cabbages, and peanuts out of her house. She has been in these two businesses for two years. \r\n \r\nWith the MFI Hekima loan, she hopes to increase her sales by buying $50 worth of jerseys, $100 of dishes, $30 worth of underwear, $30 worth of padlocks, $10 worth of bras, some boxes of razors, and pay for transport costs to and from her supply point. In future she hopes to be able to rent a store in Goma so that she won't have to sell her wares on foot. She would like to be able to buy a plot of land, and to educate and comfortably nourish her children. \r\n\r\nOur client, Etita L., thanks Hekima for the loan she is to receive which will allow her to expand her commercial activities. \r\n\r\nThis group, 'Lumi\u00e8re,' is composed of 31 members, most of them women. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva

After two group loans and two individual loans, all correctly reimbursed, she is now requesting a third individual loan.\r\n\r\nShe intends to buy: 8 bags of wheat flour, 8 containers of vegetable oil, 6 bags of salt, and 4 bags of sugar, all of which will be purchased from local wholesalers. She sells her pancakes at the main market in Sikasso, and her customers are essentially women.\r\n\r\nWith this loan she hopes to reach monthly earnings of 150,000 FCFA, which will be used to deal with the majority of family expenses, reimburse the loan, and reinvest the remainder in her activity.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ren\u00e9 McConnell, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":507367,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"Pour acheter  de farine de bl\u00e9, de sucre, sel et d\u2019huile d\u2019arachide.

Mutabar thanks everyone supporting her and promises to manage the loan as accurately as usual.  \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

in 1949, Yoribek is married and the father of three adult children. Although he is primarily a farmer, he also raises animals, a sideline that he feels passionate about. Selling animals he has raised is his special source of income. However, Yoribek raises his animals in the traditional fashion, which does not provide much in the way of financial returns. Interested in modernizing his operation to earn more from it, Yoribek would like to build a pen for his animals and also add other cattle to his flocks. Accomplishing this will allow him to increase his income and better provide for his family.  \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She is 45 years old, divorced and the mother of four children ages 23, 21, 12 and 9, all students. She finished 6th grade but had to drop school for lack of financial help. She lives in her own house with her children and also supports a 3 year old grandaughter that lives with them. \r\nShe left Matola for Maputo when she got married, and has had her own business for the past 20 years. She doesn't have any employees but her children help her out. She sells sugar, fish, chicken, oil and other items and is able to make around U$370 per month, which she uses to pay household expenses and save some. \r\nShe learned about Hluvuku through friends that are clients. This is her first loan in the amount of U$475, and she'll use it to buy more merchandise (sugar, fish, chicken, jam, oil and others) to improve her business. She's committed to pay the loan back on time and hopes to get more loans in the future, as she dreams of having her own grocery shop one day.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Mariana Dauwe, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":507405,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchase of food products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Boane, Maputo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-26.041667 32.325278","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":"2010-03-18T17:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Esperanca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":15000,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":659.14},{"due_date":"2010-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":688.93},{"due_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":720.08},{"due_date":"2010-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":752.63},{"due_date":"2010-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":786.65},{"due_date":"2010-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":822.21},{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":859.38},{"due_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":898.23},{"due_date":"2010-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":938.84},{"due_date":"2010-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":981.28},{"due_date":"2011-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1025.64},{"due_date":"2011-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1072},{"due_date":"2011-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1120.46},{"due_date":"2011-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1171.11},{"due_date":"2011-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1224.05},{"due_date":"2011-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1279.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.87},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.82},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.8},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.83},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.92},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.03},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.22},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.44},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.73},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.07},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.48},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.95},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.48},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.09},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.76},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.51}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":38.89,"local_amount":1228.2,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:14:42Z","rounded_local_amount":1240.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128972166,"comment":null},{"amount":26.6,"local_amount":839.95,"processed_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:28:01Z","rounded_local_amount":848.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144732382,"comment":null},{"amount":409.51,"local_amount":12931.85,"processed_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-01T07:59:46Z","rounded_local_amount":13064.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151916203,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-03-18T20:59:31Z","paid_date":"2010-09-01T07:59:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":185243,"name":"Phelomina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Phelomina A. cooks banku (locally called by the Fante\u2019s as 'etiw') and fried fish to sell at Elmina.

She has two children, for whom took out a loan to buy welding equipment so they could work.  She lives in the Maica Sud community in Cochabamba.  She has three cows, and uses their milk to make cheese, which she sells in the different markets in the city of Cochabamba as well as to the people who sell Charque (a traditional Cochababma dish,  eaten with cheese).  Delfina has been making cheese for more than thirty-two years.\r\n\r\nWith the loan she received through Kiva last year, Delfina was able to buy food (corn husks) for her milk cows.  Due to drought, prices increased significantly and she wasn't able to buy all the food her cows needed.  With the loan, she had no problem continuing to produce the same amount of milk and, accordingly, cheese.  Delfina hopes she'll be able to get this loan to buy a milk cow so she can increase milk production and with it her income.  She really appreciates the people who, through Kiva, have put their trust in her and given her the opportunity to better herself.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jill Heske, Kiva

quesillo junto con su madre, ella trabaja desde que era una ni\u00f1a colaborando para ayudar en la educaci\u00f3n de su hermano ya que en nuestro pa\u00eds es algo ignorado las personas que tienen s\u00edndrome de Down son personas rechazadas a las cuales no les brinda la atenci\u00f3n para poderlos ayudar a salir adelante ya que los centros de ayuda son en la ciudad los cuales se les hace muy lejos para la do\u00f1a Francisca el poderle llevar y que le ayuden a su hijo es por esa raz\u00f3n que Deisy tuvo que dejar la escuela y poder trabajar para ayudar a su madre porque el papa muri\u00f3 en un accidente de tr\u00e1nsito en la cual ellos quedaron solos y la madre de Deisy es una persona ya mayor y ella tiene que hacerse cargo de su hermano como tambi\u00e9n de madre al ser

old.  She lives with her mother, Francisca L., and her brother, who has Down syndrome.  They live in Esquilan Chico to the south of the road to Quillacollo, which is a province in Cochabamba.\r\n\r\nDeisy is a hard-working girl, who devotes herself to milk production and making \u201cquesillo\u201d (soft cheese) with her mother.  She has worked since she was a girl.  She was contributing in order to help with her brother\u2019s education.  In our country it is ignored.  People with Down syndrome are rejected.  They are not offered the help they need to get ahead.  The help centers are in the city.  It is very far for Francisca to be able to take him there for help.  \r\n\r\nThat is the reason that Deisy had to leave school to be able to work to help her mother.  Her father died in a transit accident, and they were left alone.  Deisy\u2019s mother is elderly.  Deisy has to be in charge of her brother, like a mother, as she is the only responsible person in her family.  She tries to help him.  It hurts her to have left school because she dreamed of studying medicine in order to know why her brother has this problem.  Deisy is very sad to be in this situation because she has to be responsible for her brother.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan to buy soy in order to be able to increase the milk production and the making of quesillo.  Having more income will allow her to offer her family a better standard of living and to keep up her constant support of her brother.  \r\n\r\nShe hopes that in the future she might be able to finish school.  She does not dream of having her own family because she does not want to hurt her brother.  She loves him a lot because he is a very affectionate boy.  He helps at home with the cows, and sometimes he goes to cut alfalfa with their mother.  He loves her a lot and does not leave her alone.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

She is 33 years old and is a divorced mother of four children, ages 16, 10, 7, and 4. The three eldest children attend school. She only attended school through 7th grade herself and stopped because of a teen pregnancy. She lives in her own home with her children and she does not support anyone else. She has never left Boane - she has lived her whole life in this district. <p>\r\n<p\/>\r\nShe has had her own business for more than 15 years and she has one employee who helps her. She earns about 7,000MT per month which she uses to pay for household expenses and to save to her bank account. She has never taken a loan with another bank. She came to know Hluvuku through her neighbor who was already a client of the institution. This is her fourth loan and is for the amount of 20,000MT. She plans to use this to purchase construction materials (cement, iron, sand, stone, and others) to continue work on her home. The previous loans were for 15,300MT, 20,000MT, and 20,000MT and were all used for the same purpose. In the future she would like to take out more loans to grow her business and to protect her home. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Michelle Harrison, Kiva

However, instead of lamenting over her destiny, she started her business of sewing national items. Now, she is a sixty-year-old widow. Her son is already married and lives separately. She has a grandson. He attends the local school. Her revenue is 3,000 KGS (69$) per month. In the future, she plans to provide an education for her grandson.

He is asking for 18,000 meticais, which he will use to buy construction materials (cement, iron, sand and other materials) to continue building his house.  The previous loans were for 5,000 meticais, 6,000 meticais, 12,000 meticais and 15,000 meticais, all for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nIn the future he would like to ask for more loans to finish building his house.

(In fact, many of Esperanza's Dominican clients are recent emigrates from Haiti.)\r\n\r\nRafael's group is located in the slums that surround Santiago, a large city which is known for its tobacco production and where running water (none of which is potable) and electricity are unreliable. Rafael makes his home here in a simple structure with his long-term partner and their four children.\r\n\r\nRafael is excited to be taking out his second loan with Esperanza after having successfully repaid his previous loan and grown his business. \r\n\r\nRafael runs a neighborhood food cart, and he plans to use this loan to stock his cart with staples such as Yuca, potatoes, bananas, and eggs to sell to his clientele. He will use the profits to provide the basic necessities for his children, such as food and clothing, as well as save toward the day when he hopes to open his own supermarket.  He thanks you all for your support.

They consistently put forth huge efforts in order to lead a decent life.  Some of them are the only providers for their families.  Kumushay A. is the leader of the group.  She is a mother of three children: two sons and one daughter.  All of the children attend universities, and the huge burden for paying their education contracts lies on the shoulders of Kumushay and her husband.  In order to provide the children with education, Kumushay took out a loan in the sum of five thousand som ($100) in 2001 and started selling various goods (seeds, chewing gum, candy, etc.) at a store that she opened together with her husband near their home.  She was fortunate to have the store near a school.  The sales were very good, and soon Kumushay and her husband were able to increase the goods turnover to twenty thousand som ($450).  Their current net monthly profit from the sales is from five to six thousand som.  Her husband and daughter primarily work at the store now.  Kumushay found a salesperson job at a pharmacy opposite a hospital and receives a salary in the sum of four thousand som ($90).  She needed means to increase goods turnover and merchandise variety at their store.  This is why she requested this loan.\r\n\r\nHer group partners are:\r\n\r\nElmira B. is forty-five years old.  Her husband works as a security guard.  Elmira has three children, two of whom attend universities.  Elmira works as a cook at a caf\u00e9.  She needs a loan in order to repay a debt for son\u2019s education.  Her son is in his first year of a law academy.\r\n\r\nBurulush B. is fifty-four years old.  She is a mother of two children.  The children are already grown and earn their own living.  The son is involved in livestock sales, and Burulush makes national goods to-order.  She has consistent customers.  Burulush needs a loan to help her son buy several sheep for resale.\r\n\r\nRahatbek Dyushenov is thirty-five years old.  His wife is a homemaker, and this is why he is mainly responsible for supporting the family.  Rahatbek is involved in agriculture.  He buys livestock, fattens it and resells it.

He lives in a town called El Torno. El Torno is the fourth municipal section of the province of Santi Iva\u00f1ez, of the  Departament of Santa Cruz. It is divided into four cantons with 65 farming communities. According to the last census from 2002, the town of El Torno has 40,000 inhabitants.  It is a young population, made up of migrants from the country's interior. From the west, Quechuas and Aymaras; from the east, and also people native to the area. \r\n\r\nIn Santa Cruz there are large social differences that inhabit the same space. Next to the great \"quintas\", the properties of landholders and people with bigger purchasing power in Santa Cruz, live the residents of the area themselves. They live in houses that are mainly of simple construction (adobe and roofs thatched with palm).   There is a difference between the towns of Santa Rita and Santa Marta 1 and Santa Marta 2. These are found next to the old highway to Cochabamba. There you will find homes made of brick and tile next to the simplest homes. The farming communities are towards the mountains' interior. These are all made of adobe and thatch and of much humbler conditions. Water and electricity services aren't available there.  \r\n\r\nThese towns are at a distance of between 5 and 20 kilometers from the interior (the pastoral area that volunteers must attend). This pastoral area is made up of 9 communities, accessed by dirt roads on which wagons sometimes pass to be able to access them.  The town's economy is based on fish farming and fruit growing. It is also based on the extraction of stone, gravel and sand from the Pira\u00ed river that encircles the town. There is also a lot of commerce, especially in the town of El Torno, where there is a market where agricultural workers' products are sold.   \r\n\r\nJaime Has been working with EMPRENDER for 2 years. The first loan was to buy a lot of land in the town of San Luis. He has been working this land and is in the process of buying 2 more hectares. With the money from the loan, he will buy seed to plant potatoes and later sell them in the area market. He expects to pay off this loan and take out a larger one.  He is very grateful to Emprender and Kiva for the confidence they have in him in granting him this loan.  \r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ellen Donohue, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":507499,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy seed to plant potatoes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jaime Alcides \t\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":700,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2011-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":175}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":175,"local_amount":175,"processed_date":"2010-06-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:38:59Z","rounded_local_amount":175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151879804,"comment":null},{"amount":175,"local_amount":175,"processed_date":"2010-09-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:57:20Z","rounded_local_amount":175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172100780,"comment":null},{"amount":175,"local_amount":175,"processed_date":"2010-12-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:55:28Z","rounded_local_amount":175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188668632,"comment":null},{"amount":175,"local_amount":175,"processed_date":"2011-03-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:51:59Z","rounded_local_amount":175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201272985,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-04-11T23:03:06Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T10:51:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":185291,"name":"Zenon","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Zen\u00f3n vive en casa propia con su esposa y su hijo menor; maneja un auto con el cual trabajaba como asalariado percibiendo un ingreso de 50Bs por d\u00eda; con sus ahorros pag\u00f3 la mitad del costo de su movilidad y el cr\u00e9dito que solicita es para pagar el saldo y que el auto sea de su propiedad ya que como due\u00f1o puede generar mejores ingresos.\n\nEs cliente de Impro desde el a\u00f1o 2002 y su historial de pagos es muy bueno, por lo que puede acceder a un nuevo cr\u00e9dito.\n","en":"Se\u00f1or Zen\u00f3n lives in his own house with his wife and youngest son.

El se\u00f1or actualmente esta trabajando en una construccion, en El Torno Bolivia ( El Torno es la cuarta secci\u00f3n municipal de la provincia Santi Iva\u00f1ez, del Departamento de Santa Cruz. Est\u00e1 dividida en cuatro cantones con 65 comunidades campesinas. De acuerdo al \u00faltimo censo realizado el a\u00f1o 2002, la poblaci\u00f3n de El Torno alcanza a 40.000 habitantes.\nEs una poblaci\u00f3n joven, constituida por emigrantes venidos del interior del pa\u00eds: del occidente, quechuas, aymaras y de los valles del oriente, as\u00ed como de las personas aut\u00f3ctonas.\nComo caracter\u00edstica de Santa Cruz, existen grandes diferencias sociales que conviven en un mismo espacio. Junto a grandes \"quintas\", propiedad de terratenientes y personas de mayor poder adquisitivo en Santa Cruz, conviven los propios habitantes de la zona, con construcciones mayormente sencillas (adobe y techo de motac\u00fa). Existe una diferencia entre las poblaciones de Santa Rita y Santa Marta 1 y Santa Marta 2, que se encuentran al borde de la carretera antigua a Cochabamba, donde se encuentran viviendas de ladrillo y teja junto a las m\u00e1s sencillas, y las poblaciones campesinas que se encuentran hacia el interior de la monta\u00f1a, que son puramente de adobe y motac\u00fa, con condiciones mucho m\u00e1s sencillas, donde no llegan el agua y la luz.\nEstas poblaciones se encuentran a una distancia de entre 5 y 20 kil\u00f3metros hacia el interior (en la zona pastoral que deben atender los voluntarios). Dicha zona pastoral est\u00e1 compuesta de 9 comunidades, a las que se accede por caminos de tierra por los que a veces pasan vagonetas para poder acceder a ellas.\nLa econom\u00eda de la poblaci\u00f3n se basa en la producci\u00f3n agropecuaria y frut\u00edcola, as\u00ed como el trabajo de extracci\u00f3n de piedra, ripio y arena del r\u00edo Pira\u00ed que circunda a todo el municipio.

He lives with Celia, and they have two children.  He has worked as a bricklayer for 15 years.  Celia works selling clothes in the central market in El Torno.\r\n\r\nSantos is currently working on construction in El Torno, Bolivia.  (El Torno is the fourth municipal section in the Santi Iva\u00f1ez province in the Santa Cruz department.)  It is divided into four cantons with 65 rural communities.  According to the 2002 census, the population is up to 40,000 inhabitants.  It is a young population made up of emigrants coming from the interior of the country, from the west, Quechuas, Aymaras, and people from the eastern valleys like the Aut\u00f3ctonas.\r\n\r\nSanta Cruz can be characterized as having great social differences existing in the same area.  Large \u201cquintas\u201d, property of landowners acquired in Santa Cruz, and people with greater power co-exist with the area\u2019s own inhabitants who live in more modest houses (adobe with roofs made of palm fronds).  \r\n\r\nA difference exists between the populations of Santa Rita, Santa Marta 1, and Santa Marta 2.  These places can be found on the border of the old road to Cochabamba.  You can find houses there that are made of brick and tile along with more modest houses.  There are also rural populations, which can be found towards the interior of the mountain.  The houses there are solely made of adobe and palm fronds under more modest conditions.  They do not have water or electrical services.\r\n\r\nThese populations can be found between 5 and 20 kilometers towards the interior (in the pastoral region the volunteers need to take care of).  This pastoral zone is comprised of nine communities, which can be accessed by dirt roads.  Sometimes trucks are used to be able to access the communities.\r\n\r\nThe population\u2019s economy is based on farming, fishing, and growing fruit.  People also work at extracting rocks, debris, and sand from the Pira\u00ed River, which surrounds the entire municipality.  There is also great commercial activity, especially in El Torno.  A market is set up in El Torno, and farm products are sold there.\r\n\r\nHe is grateful to the institution for the support they have given him.  He will be able to buy a few more work materials and tools such as a trowel, a shovel, and other things.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by

She needs a loan to pay for the expenses of transporting the wood, for example, to pay for the transport permit needed to bring wood from one city to another.\r\n\r\nThe members in general appreciate the opportunity provided, and they are committed to making each of their payments in the established timeframe.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3600,"image":{"id":505011,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to pay for the transportation costs of wood, for example, to pay for the permit needed to transport wood from one city to another","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":119,"posted_date":"2010-03-17T03:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ruth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ronald Aquino","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joseph Jeremy","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Exaltacio","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Antonio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dany Luz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gianfranco","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"James Anthony","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cesar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Linda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":10150,"loan_amount":3600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2390.21},{"due_date":"2010-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2485.83},{"due_date":"2010-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2585.27},{"due_date":"2010-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2688.69}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":847.76},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":881.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":916.95},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":953.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":848.63,"local_amount":2392.67,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:48:39Z","rounded_local_amount":2394,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136633551,"comment":null},{"amount":882.59,"local_amount":2488.41,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:49:11Z","rounded_local_amount":2489.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144667970,"comment":null},{"amount":917.88,"local_amount":2587.9,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:24:30Z","rounded_local_amount":2589.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151851628,"comment":null},{"amount":950.9,"local_amount":2681.02,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:14:06Z","rounded_local_amount":2682.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159589933,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-03-23T20:45:43Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T10:14:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":185304,"name":"German","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or German vive en alquiler con su esposa e hijos en la zona San Mart\u00edn  de la ciudad de La Paz,; Germ\u00e1n trabaja como chofer asalariado con un micro de transporte publico.\n\nEl cr\u00e9dito que solicita es para generar una fuente de empleo para su esposa quien se dedica a la venta de CDs  en blanco y grabados en cantidad.El dinero se utilizar\u00e1 para comprar m\u00e1s Cds.\n\nEs cliente de Impro desde el a\u00f1o 2007  y con un historial de pagos muy bueno, por lo que puede acceder a un nuevo cr\u00e9dito.\n","en":"\r\nGerman lives in a rented house with his wife and children in La Paz's San Mart\u00edn neighborhood; he works as a salaried driver of a public transportation minibus.\r\n\r\nHe is asking for funds to launch a business for his wife, who sells blank and recorded CDs in bulk.

His father, Leonos, and his deceased mother, Pastora, started him working in agriculture.  He works as a farmer in Surutu, which is 40 km from El Torno.   El Torno is the fourth municipal section in the Santi Iva\u00f1ez province in the Santa Cruz department.  It is divided into four cantons with 65 rural communities.  According to the 2002 census, the population is up to 40,000 inhabitants.  \r\n\r\nIt is a young population made up of emigrants coming from the interior of the country, from the west, Quechuas, Aymaras, and people from the eastern valleys like the Aut\u00f3ctonas.\r\n\r\nSanta Cruz can be characterized as having great social differences existing in the same area.  Large \u201cquintas\u201d, property of landowners acquired in Santa Cruz, and people with greater power co-exist with the area\u2019s own inhabitants who live in more modest houses (adobe with roofs made of palm fronds).  \r\n\r\nA difference exists between the populations of Santa Rita, Santa Marta 1, and Santa Marta 2.  These places can be found on the border of the old road to Cochabamba.  You can find houses there that are made of brick and tile along with more modest houses.  There are also rural populations, which can be found towards the interior of the mountain.  The houses there are solely made of adobe and palm fronds under more modest conditions.  They do not have water or electrical services.\r\n\r\nThese populations can be found between 5 and 20 kilometers towards the interior (in the pastoral region the volunteers need to take care of).  This pastoral zone is comprised of nine communities, which can be accessed by dirt roads.  Sometimes trucks are used to be able to access the communities.\r\n\r\nThe population\u2019s economy is based on agriculture, fishing, and growing fruit.  People also work at extracting rocks, debris, and sand from the Pira\u00ed River, which surrounds the entire municipality.  There is also great commercial activity, especially in El Torno.  A market is set up in El Torno, and farm products are sold there.\r\n\r\nHe has his own house, and he is single.  He takes everything he harvests to El Torno to sell.  He goes on the week-ends due to the transportation problem.  Transportation in the area is scarce.  He will use the money from the loan to buy seeds to plant potatoes.  He is a hard-working young man.\r\n\r\nHe is very grateful to Emprender and Kiva for the trust placed in him by granting him the loan.\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":507519,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Buy seeds to plant potatoes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Reynaldo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":250,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-06-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:39:13Z","rounded_local_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151879806,"comment":null},{"amount":250,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-09-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:57:33Z","rounded_local_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172100782,"comment":null},{"amount":250,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-12-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:55:55Z","rounded_local_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188668634,"comment":null},{"amount":250,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2011-03-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:52:28Z","rounded_local_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201272987,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-04-11T21:03:04Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T10:52:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":185306,"name":"Petrona Mar\u00eda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Petrona M. tiene 62 a\u00f1os y viven en la Urbanizaci\u00f3n La Playa de Barranquilla con su hija de 23 a\u00f1os; ella siempre ha sido una mujer negociante,  hace quince a\u00f1os inici\u00f3 su negocio de preparaci\u00f2n de alimentos con harina de trigo como empanaditas, deditos; un tipo de pasaboca frita, enrollados en diferentes formas; con los a\u00f1os agreg\u00f3 otros negocios como venta de mercancias  mediante gu\u00edas especializadas  de productos empresariales; hace siete a\u00f1os adicion\u00f2 la venta de calzado y el negocio de comidas r\u00e1pidas hace tres. \u00daltimamente Petrona ha decidido dejar su negocio de pasabocas porque el calor le empez\u00f3 a afectar sus  manos.

She has always been a merchant and 15 years ago she started a prepared meals business based on wheat-flour items like: empanaditas (little turnovers, deditos (a type of fried snack), and various types of rolls.  As time went by, she added other commercial activities, like catalogue merchandise sales.  Seven years ago she added shoe sales.  With her fast-food business, she now has a total of three.  Recently, Petrona decided to abandon her fast-food business because the heat started to affect her hands.  Now she is involved in tutoring children and to provide room and board for persons who come from other cities to study in Barranquilla.\r\n\r\nHer school children tutoring services are from 2-6pm when they get out of school; her daughter participates in this activity.  Since she owns her own home, she can rent space to students from other places and this room and board service is an additional source of income for her and her daughter.\r\n\r\nShe is asking the foundation for a loan, valued at $1.000.000, to invest in this last commercial activity; specifically, to make home improvements.  She will fill in the patio in order to redirect rainwater drainage, install flooring and a wash stand for laundry and will purchase gutters.\r\n\r\nPetrona has been associated with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo for 5 years and has had 7 loans during this time frame.  She feels that they have made it possible for her to pay for her daughter\u2019s education as a Systems Engineer and that her being able to study this career was due to the foundation\u2019s help.\r\n\r\nDespite the challenges she and her daughter have faced, like times of low sales and the physical and time limitations they have because they live alone, she has managed to get ahead and now dreams with finishing her house and having income that will provide her with much stability in every sense of the word.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva

M. tiene 32 a\u00f1os y vive con sus 2 hijos de 10 y 6 a\u00f1os en el Barrio Abajo de Barranquilla, barrio que para todos barranquilleros tiene un v\u00ednculo muy fuerte con los Carnavales. Marisela tiene 2 negocios: un hogar geri\u00e1trico que apoya con su otro negocio de venta de mercanc\u00eda en general. El cr\u00e9dito anterior lo invirtieron inicialmente en el mejoramiento de una habitaci\u00f3n que actualmente ocupa una anciana, pero tambi\u00e9n le ha permitido  generar mayores ingresos tanto para adquirir varios electrodom\u00e9sticos como una nevera y una estufa, como para comprar algunos elementos para el cuidado de los ancianos entre elementos como un tensi\u00f3metro, una silla de rueda de segunda y un ba\u00f1o port\u00e1til. El financiamiento de $1.500.000 que ahora solicita lo invertir\u00e1 en la compra de leche en polvo por proveniente de Maicao, ciudad fronteriza cerca de Venezuela y que vende por kilo a sus vecinos y familiares.  \nEn el a\u00f1o 2001 su madre, a su lado en la fotograf\u00eda, trabajaba de enfermera en un hogar geri\u00e1trico y se independiz\u00f3 con ella aprovechando su experiencia. Es as\u00ed como  han pasado por el hogar, cinco  personas en 5 a\u00f1os de los cuales se han muerto 2 y actualmente tienen 2.  En su negocio prestan el servicio de enfermer\u00eda, asistencia alimentaria y atenci\u00f3n en general  y tienen la particularidad de acoger a los ancianos y brindarles mucho cari\u00f1o, hasta el punto de que a los que cuidan en sus hogares se quieren venir a vivir con ellas. Marisela tiene una t\u00eda en Venezuela adonde su madre viaja constantemente para comprar leche y ella se encarga de distribuirla y venderla a sus clientes. Tambi\u00e9n desde hace un a\u00f1o compra seg\u00fan la tasa del bol\u00edvar, la moneda venezolana varios art\u00edculos como zapatos, bolsos y v\u00edveres para la venta. Las dos son muy unidas y colaboran mutuamente en el negocio.\nComo el oficio en el hogar geri\u00e1trico requiere mucha dedicaci\u00f3n ya que los ancianos demandan mucho cuidado, no les queda mucho tiempo libre y esto les impide recrearse e invertirlo en otras actividades. Sin embargo, con el desarrollo del negocio Marisela est\u00e1 pensando en c\u00f3mo realizar su sue\u00f1o de progresar al m\u00e1ximo para adquirir su propia vivienda, y esto es su gran desaf\u00edo ya que donde viven actualmente es arrendado.\n","en":"Marisela C. M., age 32, lives with her two children, ages 10 and 6, in the Barrio Abajo neighborhood of Barranquilla.  All of the people in this neighborhood have a strong tie to the Carnivals.  \r\n\r\nMarisela has two businesses.  She has a geriatric home, which she supports with her other business of selling general merchandise.  She initially used the previous loan to improve a room that is currently occupied by an elderly person.  But, it also allowed her to generate greater income so much that she got several domestic appliances like a refrigerator and a stove.  She also bought some items like a blood pressure cuff, a second hand wheelchair, and a portable toilet to take care of the elderly.\r\n\r\nShe will use the $1,500,000 COP that she is now requesting to buy powdered milk from Maicao, a city on the border near Venezuela.  She sells by the kilo to her neighbors and relatives.\r\n\r\nIn 2001 her mother, by her side in the photograph, worked as a nurse in a geriatric home.  She became independent with her, taking advantage of her experience.  That is how they came to have the home.  They have had five people in five years.  Two of them have died, and they currently have two.\r\n\r\nIn her business they provide nursing services, nutritional help, and general services.  They have the ability to take in the elderly and give them a lot of affection.  This gets to the point where the people they take care of in their homes want to come live with them.\r\n\r\nMarisela has an aunt in Venezuela, and her mother travels there constantly to buy milk.  She takes charge of distributing it and selling it to her customers.  Also, for a year she has been buying, according to the rate for the bol\u00edvar, Venezuelan money, things such as shoes, bags, and supplies to sell.  The two of them are very united, and they collaborate in the business.\r\n\r\nAs the work in the geriatric home requires much dedication because the elderly demand much care, there is not much free time.  This keeps them from recreation and investing in other activities.  Nevertheless, with the development of the business Marisela is thinking of how to make her dream come true.  Her dream is to progress to the maximum in order to get her own house.  This is her big challenge because they rent where they currently live.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

He offers transportation services within his village and the surrounding areas.  The income he earns from these activities help with covering his personal expenses and supporting his family.

Esta bebida es muy consumida por la zona, ya que los trabajadores agr\u00edcolas de la zona piensan que esta bebida les da fuerzas para continuar con sus actividades.\n\nLa chicha de jora se prepara con un tipo especal de ma\u00edz denominado jora, este ma\u00edz se muele y se hierve en grandes ollas hasta que est\u00e9 completamente cocido, luego se le agrega az\u00facar y se deja fermentar en vasijas de barro.

She makes the chicha in her home and offers it to her neighbors and acquaintances.  This drink is commonly consumed in this area, since the agricultural workers here think that the drink gives them strength to continue with their activities.  \r\n\r\nThe chicha de jora is made with a special type of corn called \"jora\" that is ground, and boiled in large pots until it is completely cooked.  Later sugar is added and it is left to ferment in terra cotta containers.  This is a tradition that dates back to remote times and is continued by the people who live in the northern part of the Lambayeque region.  \r\n\r\nIn addition, Blanca raises and sells animals; she raises sheep in the back of her home and sells them to the traders who visit the area every so often.\r\n\r\nBlanca is requesting a loan from Edpyme Alternativa for 1,000 Peruvian soles which will help her to expand her chicha business.  She plans to buy more supplies (sugar, corn and firewood) with the money from the loan.  \r\n\r\nShe is a cheerful woman who is always looking for ways to keep active and help support her family.  Her main desire is to continue to advance her family economically and to provide her children with the opportunity to continue their studies at the college level.

Sylvie Dansivi does her shopping at Dantokpa, an international market of B\u00e9nin.\r\n\r\nSylvie Dansivi has already had one loan besides the one from Alid\u00e9, and has repaid.  Her customers increase a little more each day and she can no longer satisfy all of them.

Z. is 36 years old, and as a 1 year old daughter. She grows tubers (potatoes, oca, ulluco) and legumes (broad beans, peas). Mar\u00eda has been doing this for over 6 years and her products are sold in the cold of Colomi. The agricultural inputs that she uses are: organic fertiliser (from chickens), certified seeds that are acquired in the agricultural shops in Colomi, plus preparing the land for sowing time.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Marlene lives in the community of Liriuni, 1 kilometre from Colomi to the north of the village. She lives in her father's house. He doesn't have sight, as he lost it 20 years ago. Mar\u00eda Marlene works to look after her father and daughter. She is a very hard-working and contracts casual labour for sowing and harvesting.   \r\n\r\nIt is difficult for them to go to banks in the city in search of a loan. CIDRE is in the Colomi zone and so it is easier for them to get a loan from CIDRE to puchase the agricultural inputs that they need for sowing the next season of crops. In this way they will increase their production of potatoes. Mar\u00eda Marlene tells us that she is going to marry her daughter's father. Her biggest dream is that she has her own house with good comforts, and savings so that her daughter can study. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jane McCrory, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":507616,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Compra de Insumos Agricolas","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Cochabamba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.383333 -66.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":140,"posted_date":"2010-03-17T05:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Marlene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2012-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:02:27Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144689307,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:45:11Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159612795,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:54:01Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172093405,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:37:39Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182523271,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:36:07Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191401034,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-16T08:13:02Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201262029,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:53:50Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211200956,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T07:53:34Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221642154,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-16T07:53:52Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232770001,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:35:37Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244534888,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-17T08:54:34Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257540018,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-03-17T18:39:16Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":185362,"name":"Dine","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"N\u00e9e en 1973 \u00e0 Porto-Novo, capitale administrative du B\u00e9nin, A.

He has a Store and bakery that he began a little over a year ago in a very informal way, when he worked as an employee of a bakery.  He started by selling  ricecakes to his neighbors, an activity that his wife carried out of their house while he worked as a baker.  This business was growing and he added new products such as oil, grains and provisions according to the demand of his initial domestic market.  Today he has a well stocked store and bakery, to which he dedicates a great part of his time.   He also teaches music, which generates additional income.  With his 6 years of experience as a baker, he makes delicious tidbits from the left-over wheat flour, which he also sells in his business.  Currently he requests a credit by value of 1,300,000 Columbian pesos (about $700 US) to buy merchandise and a metal mat to add elegance and greater security to his business.

G. is 35 years old and resides in the Department of Usulut\u00e1n.  There she lives with her three children (ages 15, 13, and 9) who attend school.  Ana sells tortillas from her home and prepares them Monday through Sunday at noon.  On Fridays and Saturdays she also sells tamales, which sell very well.  Ana is a very responsible woman who works extremely hard to succeed for her three daughters, who are completely dependent on their mother.  Ana is a single mother and, thanks to her work, is able to provide all the necessities for her children.\r\n<p>\r\nShe is requesting a loan so that she can purchase large quantities of corn for preparing tortillas and tamales.  Ana will also buy chicken, potatoes, and leaves for filling and wrapping the tamales.  She hopes to increase her production, since this is the only way for her to make a living.  For this reason, it is very important for her to improve her sales.  She has many customers, but she is at a disadvantage because she does not have enough materials on hand.  Ana was encouraged to apply for this loan from Apoyo Integral and hopes that it will improve her quality of life.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

Juana learned this traD. from a neighbor for whom she worked for some time.   Later she maD. an effort to convince her husband to buy a weaving machine so that she could produce her own items and have her own customers.  Upon receiving requests, Juana started making baby clothes and nothing else.  She says that she does not produce adult clothing because it requires more capital, so she sticks to weaving clothes for babies.  Juana\u2019s current loan is for 1000 BOB, which she will invest in wool.  For her next loan, she hopes to buy another machine for the possibility of making sweaters for adults.   \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1825,"image":{"id":507674,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","use":"Purchase wool","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2010-03-17T06:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1825,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juana Emiliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pacesa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teodora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florencia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Josefa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ignacia Virginia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felipa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":12525.24,"loan_amount":1825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2087.6},{"due_date":"2010-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":2087.6},{"due_date":"2010-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2087.6},{"due_date":"2010-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2087.6},{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2087.6},{"due_date":"2010-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2087.24}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":304.18},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":304.17},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":304.18},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":304.17},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":304.18},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":304.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":304.18,"local_amount":2087.6,"processed_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:05:42Z","rounded_local_amount":2114.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136735988,"comment":null},{"amount":304.17,"local_amount":2087.6,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:56:56Z","rounded_local_amount":2114.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144769372,"comment":null},{"amount":304.18,"local_amount":2087.6,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:14:23Z","rounded_local_amount":2114.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151951848,"comment":null},{"amount":304.17,"local_amount":2087.6,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:55:06Z","rounded_local_amount":2114.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159691381,"comment":null},{"amount":304.18,"local_amount":2087.6,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:53:30Z","rounded_local_amount":2114.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166905794,"comment":null},{"amount":304.12,"local_amount":2087.24,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:37:44Z","rounded_local_amount":2113.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172173678,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-03-17T16:36:01Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:37:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":185384,"name":"Fredis Antonio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Fredis Antonio F.

They got together on January 9th, 2008, and their current executive director is Sra. Acela C\u00e9spedes. She contacted an advisor at one of the weekly meetings in the area to learn more about the work of the Mujeres Emprendedoras committee. After receiving that advice, Acela managed to get together a group of 22 women who work together well and provide each other with support within the program.\r\n\r\nSra. Acela is one of the members. After joining the group of women, she decided to open a business selling a range of items such as school supplies, uniforms, decorations etc. With the loan that Acela receives, she plans to buy the products that her customers need. The business is very important to the family since the income helps greatly with household finances as well as clothes for the children and other school expenses.\r\n\r\nThe loan is to buy general

She is married to Mariano, who is retired. They have a young grandson who helps her to purchase sweets. Together they travel to the southern region of the country, as far as Bermejo, Yacuiba, Villazon, Potosi, Cochabama, and Oruro. She sells sweets for a higher price than she purchases them in Desaguadero, La Ceja, El Alto, and the south of the country. Cecilia's greatest dream, and her husband's, is to improve their home, adding another floor to increase their comfort and to live better. The money from the loan will be used to purchase construction materials. Cecilia is a very hard-working and responsible person who has never missed a loan payment.

She lives in the Villa Reconciliaci\u00f3n neighborhood with two beautiful children and her husband who works in sales at Jummy. Years ago Do\u00f1a Maria had a small general store in her home to help her husband with the bills, but she decided to finish her studies which she hadn't finished because she didn't have time because her kids were little. And it took a lot of time since she was studying, which took up most of the day, and thinking about a better life for her family.  This is why she closed her business.  Thanks to God, and to her husband, who has always supported her she now has worked for two years in a hospital in the capital, Managua, called Hospital Alem\u00e1n.  She works as a nurse and a surgeon and is happy to have achieved her goal to be a professional. \r\n\r\nWith this loan she would like to finish building a room that still needs walls, a roof, and tiles.

She is married to a man named Hector and they have two young children who live with them in their own home, which is located in a quite rural part of the central Peruvian jungle.  Her main motivation is her children, to whom she would like to provide everything she never had \u2013 for this reason, she opens the doors of her store at five o'clock in the morning every day, because it is at this early hour that her neighbors leave to work on their farms and other stores don't open until 6 AM.  This offers her a great advantage, gaining greater income with only a little extra sacrifice.  She doesn't mind it too much, either, because she enjoys serving and chatting with her clients.  She has also gotten used to this routine, since she has been running this business for over 4 years.  On the other hand, her husband works as a security guard in a mine, so he only comes home every three weeks.  Before he started this job, however, he left a few hectares of land ready to farm coffee and bananas.  \r\n\r\nHaydee would like to surprise her husband the next time he returns home, so she will fix a few of her house's problems with some wood and calamina (a mineral) to better prepare them for the harsh winter in their area.

Currently, he is studying Business Administration in a university in the city, but he also continues farming his coffee plantation, a business he has been working on for 8 years.  Roly enjoys observing the growth of his plants, which include bananas, corn, yuca, and coffee, although it can be hard work to clean them every often.  He does not enjoy trimming them with his machete or removing the weeds.  \u201cAlthough I don't enjoy it, I have to do it because I inherited these lands from my parents and I am responsible for keeping them productive,\u201d he tells us.  Additionally, since he plants all on his own, he has been able to pay for his studies on his own, which has made him more responsible.  He dreams of becoming a professional and of managing more lands.  Because of this goal, he studies from Monday to Friday so that on the weekends he can work on the farm.  In the future, he would like to be a wholesaler of coffee, so he will start to stock-pile his coffee.  This is the second loan he will receive from MFP, and he promises to be as punctual with this second loan as he was with the first in order to continue to prosper along with the other members of his communal bank.  He will use the 1000 nuevos soles that he is currently seeking to hire workers to clean and prepare the land for re-planting.  He will also buy agricultural tools like machetes, sacks, and baskets.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Julia Kastner, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":507793,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"He will hire workers to help plant his fields and he will buy agricultural tools","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-03-17T20:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roly ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:42Z","rounded_local_amount":1057.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172153911,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-03-17T22:21:34Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":185433,"name":"Esther Josefina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\n Esther C. es otra socia activa  del banco comunal El Arenal, vive en la parroquia Tarqui ubicada al  sur de la ciudad de Cuenca y tiene como atractivos las lagunas de Totoracocha y Condorcocha en las comunidades de Tutupali Grande, Esther tiene 53 a\u00f1os de edad es madre soltera y ha concebido 8 hijos que se encuentran de 37, 35, 33, 27, 25, 22, 21, 19 a\u00f1os, casi todos sus hijos son casados y viven independientes, solo tiene 2 hijos solteros el de 25 a\u00f1os pero vive en casa de su hermana y su hijo de 19 a\u00f1os quien le ayuda muy poco en la econom\u00eda de su hogar, no tiene casa propia por lo que vive en casa de un familiar.\n \nEsther se dedica a la venta de comida en el mercado 27 de Junio en su comunidad, solo vende los d\u00edas domingos laborando desde las 6 a.m. hasta terminar  sus preparaciones y su mam\u00e1 fue quien la ense\u00f1\u00f3 a preparar y sazonar su exquisita comida.

To make a living, Hilaria owns and operates a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling both food and daily use products in the local community. Hilaria has been engaged in her business for over seven years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2007, Hilaria joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Hilaria is requesting a new loan of 12,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase new items to expand the range of products in her store. This loan will be her seventh loan from ASKI.

Now on her fifth loan, she is requesting 25,000 pesos as additional capital for her fishing business, to be used to pay for a new motor boat and pay for one videoke (a video karaoke machine) for more revenue.\r\n<p>\r\nMervic is optimistic that she can achieve her dreams of providing a good life for her children and being able to send them to school until they finish college. She also hopes to expand her business, and if possible she will get a stall in the market where she can sell her fish. She hopes that these dreams will come true and that ASHI will, in fact, give the best direction and opportunity to her family.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout ASHI: Ahon sa Hirap Inc.

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jocelyn P. is from the village of Nattapian West, Solana, Cagayan. She is 26 years old. Jocelyn is the group leader for a 19-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n<p>\r\nJocelyn is married and has one infant child. To make a living, Jocelyn owns and operates a business that provides recycling services. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from collecting junk and other waste material for local businesses and community members. Jocelyn has been engaged in her business for over two years, and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2009, Jocelyn joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Jocelyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from ASKI. She is requesting a new loan of 13,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional waste and junk materials to sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Jocelyn from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated by the business to make improvements to her house. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n<p>\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs. \r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to
