In May of 2010, in search of an additional source of income for her family, Nataliya decided to get involved in providing food services and invested an initial sum of 80,000 som (KGS).  Putting all of her efforts into developing this business, she achieved success, and her monthly profit now amounts to about 25,000 som (KGS).  The earnings from this business allowed her to lease a more comfortable building for her cafe.  In order to continue developing her business, Nataliya requested a loan in the sum of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to increase her working capital in order to expand the selection of the cafe menu offerings and to purchase chairs and tables.  This would allow her to increase the number of customers and provide employment for local students.

Twenty-five years ago, she started her own business in animal husbandry, as a main source of income for her family.

Yola, as her friends call her lovingly, is 52 and part of the group called \u201cLas Nenas\u201d (the Girls) She says that her companions chose this name because in this group all the women are thought to be pretty and lively and cheerful. She has had a grocery store for 7 years and she set it up to have a little more income to help her husband.\r\nNow she tells us she is having problems because 8 months ago she started to lose her sight because of her diabetes and so she will have surgery in a few days.   She says that she is a little nervous but she prays to God that her operation will come out well since she needs to have the cataracts removed. She tells us that she badly needs the loan so that her store will be well supplied.   This is because there will be days when she can\u2019t leave after the surgery and will then spend all her time in the store instead of going out to sell typical snack foods on weekend evenings.   She will use the loan to buy milk, eggs, sugar, beans, cans of tuna and sardines, oil, soap, etc.  One of her dreams is to expand her business and to have a little of many products so that the people in her neighborhood don\u2019t have to travel to other areas to buy their staple items.  She is married to Jos\u00e9 Antonio and he helps her a lot with her business.  They have an 18-year old son who is in high school.\r\n\r\nThe other eleven members of the group are: Rosalba, Alma Yanet, Lizbeth, Mar\u00eda Minerva, Gloria, Alicia, Mar\u00eda del Socorro, Celia, Claudia Minerva, Alma Delia and  Mar\u00eda  Beatriz.

The group is comprised of seven women and one man, and they are very hard workers.  Each member of this group is married and has a family.  Each one of them strives day to day to get ahead.  They devote themselves to raising animals like pigs, sheep, chickens, and turkeys.  They do this in order to get income and to help when they can with the expenses, be it for their children in school or for the store in the house.  \r\n\r\nAlso, because they do not work, which is to say that they do not have fixed employment that gives them a salary, they wish to invest part of their time in something that will be productive so they can support their life partners.  They want to do this so that, together, they can get ahead with all of their current necessities. It is worth mentioning that the people in this group are very responsible and hard working.  They like working in order to improve their lives.\r\n\r\nThe San Pedro community is one of the most advanced communities in the municipality.  It has all of the public services like water and drainage, a hospital, schools, and a gas station.  It is also a densely populated community with a lot of vegetation.  Additionally, the community has a lot of professionals and a lot of children attending school.  The group decided upon the name of \u201cAltamirano\u201d because it is the name of an important writer.\r\n\r\nThe names of the eight members are:\r\n\r\n1.-David S., age 42, is requesting his loan to buy 4 sheep and grass to feed them. \r\n2.-Victoria R., age 26, is requesting the loan to buy 2 sheep, 2 pigs, and feed to raise them. \r\n3.-Patricia C., age 34, is requesting her loan to buy 4 pigs, 30 chickens, feed, and corn to raise them. \r\n4.-Ambrosia G., age 62, is requesting her loan to buy 2 pigs, 10 turkeys, 20 chickens, feed, and corn to raise them. \r\n5.-Anita R., age 23, is requesting the loan to buy 5 pigs and food to raise them. \r\n6.-Crescencia G., age 45, is asking for the loan to buy 10 pigs, feed, and corn to raise them. \r\n7.-Teresa B., age 32, requested the loan to buy 5 sheep and grass to raise them. \r\n8.-Elvira S., age 43, is requesting the loan to buy 2 pigs, 2 sheep, grass, and corn to raise them. \r\n\r\nCrescencia, age 45, is the representative of the group.  She has been married for 27 years to Crisanto, who works as a bricklayer.  They have three children.  The oldest is 29 and married.  The next one is 20 and also married.  The youngest is 17 and is in the last year of high school.  \r\n\r\nCrescencia and her husband live in their own house, which is to say that they do not pay rent.  The reason that Crescencia decided to join this group is because of the desire to undertake a business.  \u201cI am a person who likes to buy and sell my animals.  This is because I realize that at times my husband does not have work, and I help him.  I am one of those people who devote themselves to many things in order to help with my expenses and to help my family.  I do not like to stop working.  I like taking care of the animals constantly so that I am not left without anything to get ahead,\u201d says Crescencia. \r\n\r\n\u201cMy business activity consists of, once I receive my loan, going to the farms where they sell \u201clechones\u201d (this is what the pigs are called when they are still very little).  I do not have to go very far because there is a farm in my community.  I buy the pigs that I am going to raise, and I take them to my house where I have my pen.  I feed them, and I inject them so they will grow.  When they grow I buy feed to fatten them, and then I sell them.  The people in my community know me, they know that I raise pigs, and they come to me,\u201d Crescencia says proudly.\r\n\r\nCrescencia says that so far, thanks to God, she has not had any difficulty carrying out her business activity.  She has not had illnesses, and things in general have gone well for her.\r\n\r\nCrescencia\u2019s goals are very clear.  She would like to make repairs to her house with the received income.  Above all, she wants her children to lack for nothing.\r\n\r\nThe loan that the instituci\u00f3n grants her will be a big help to her in reaching her goals and to continue making progress.\r\n  \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1013069,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy pigs, sheep, and chickens.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-03-01T02:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-31T02:50:04Z","loan_amount":4575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"David","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Victoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ambrosia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Crescencia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elvira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":59000,"loan_amount":4575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":7375},{"due_date":"2012-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":7375},{"due_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":7375},{"due_date":"2012-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":7375},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":7375},{"due_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":7375},{"due_date":"2012-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":7375},{"due_date":"2012-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":7375}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":571.88},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":571.87},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":571.88},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":571.87},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":571.88},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":571.87},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":571.88},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":571.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-03-12T22:16:51Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":398176,"name":"Nilders Yoel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Nilders es un joven de 22 a\u00f1os, vive junto a su pareja en la ciudad de Ica, El departamento de Ica es el \u00fanico de la costa sur formado por planicies, tambi\u00e9n llamadas llanuras coste\u00f1as, puesto que la Cordillera de los Andes se levanta muy al interior.

Currently he and his family live in the city of Ica, which is known for agricultural exportation of asparagus and artichokes to all parts of the world; \"Iquenos\" (residents of Ica) call the region the \"land of sun.\"\r\n\r\nModesto works approximately ten hours a day, during which he assists an average of two clients, since this type of work requires a lot of time to repair fiberglass. He is the only person that offers this kind of service in the region where he works, which gives him freedom from competition - which in turn generates a good income. Modesto told us that he learned this trade as an assistant to a person who also worked in this field. When he learned how to do the repairs, he decided to go and search for new opportunities and this was how he came to open his own business. And this isn't all - he also works at a grocery store, because we all know that an extra income is always good. \r\n\r\nHe has had the idea of buying some spare parts for cars, automotive body parts, among other things, which will allow him to repair and sell them to his customers. This is the time of year when his products are in higher demand. With the profits he earns he wants to reinvest and so have more variety in products, so that he can reach his great dream: to have a peaceful and happy life.

A key principle of Islam is the prohibition of charging interest on a loan. This prohibition is based on the belief that money is only a medium of exchange and has no value in itself. In order to offer loans in a manner that is consistent with borrowers' values, FATEN charges 0% interest on this loan. However, FATEN does charge a servicing fee to cover its costs. The loan amount you see listed on Kiva includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you according to this loan\u2019s repayment schedule.

With the number of hogs he is raising, his budget is not sufficient because of the expensive price of the feed and vaccine for the hogs.The income generated from his farming and vulcanizing shop business was used for his children's education.

She also sells pine and oak firewood. She tells us that she is requesting this new loan because she needs to stock up her store as the back-to-school season is approaching. Children pass through to make purchases and Marta Alicia needs to have the products they are requesting. In addition, she wants to buy a little firewood because she is running low and they are offering two truckloads of firewood at a good price, so she wants to take advantage and purchase some so that she has it stored away when there is none available.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":990831,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy fabric for sewing uniforms and to buy traditional clothing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Aldea Sacsuy, San Juan Sacatepequez,","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":97,"posted_date":"2012-03-01T09:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-31T09:20:02Z","loan_amount":1175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Ruth ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Liria Ester","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marta Alicia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":9000,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":750.11},{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":749.99},{"due_date":"2012-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":749.99},{"due_date":"2012-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":749.99},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":749.99},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":749.99},{"due_date":"2012-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":749.99},{"due_date":"2012-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":749.99},{"due_date":"2012-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":749.99},{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":749.99},{"due_date":"2012-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":749.99},{"due_date":"2013-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":749.99}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.93},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.92},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.91},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.92},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.91},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.92},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.91},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.92},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.91},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.92},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.91},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-03-03T05:13:20Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":387707,"name":"Nolito","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nolito has five children who all go to school.

He has been accustomed to physical labor since childhood and because of this, he loves to work in the fields.  After his son's marriage, his financial position worsened, but through it all he keeps working hard to restore it.

With the aim of improving this situation, Jorge has learned how to work as an electricity installer and has been able to diversify his work so that he runs less risk of being unable to make income for his household.  Now that he carries out this business well, Jorge would like to buy some work tools.

Libardo se dedica desde hace aproximadamente 10 a\u00f1os a la actividad de la compra y venta de frutas y verduras, actividad que aprendi\u00f3 trabajando para una empresa que hac\u00eda esto pero al ver que su empleo era muy mal remunerado decidi\u00f3 independizarse y sacar su propio negocio adelante.

De esta manera, Libardo afirma que el genera sus ingresos y a la vez le brinda una ayuda a los agricultores porque ellos no tienen como llevar sus productos hasta la ciudad, y la empresa que hace esto, para la que trabajaba Libardo, abusaba del trabajo de los Agricultores. Libardo le compra la mercanc\u00eda a los agricultores a cr\u00e9dito, pues no cuenta con un buen capital para poderla comprar a contado, sin embargo, Libardo quiere cambiar esta situaci\u00f3n, pues a menudo los agricultores necesitan el dinero para poder sostener sus propios gastos.

He is married and the father of six children to whom he has always given a good education, offering them the best he could.  For approximately ten years Libardo has been buying and selling fruit and vegetables.  He learned the trade while working for a company in the sector, but since he felt his job was not well paid he decided to become independent and set up his own business.  Libardo buys produce from farmers near his home and then travels to the city to sell it at the markets.  This way Libardo generates his own income and also helps the farmers because they have no way of transporting the goods to the city.  The company that does this type of thing, which is where Libardo worked before, used to abuse the farmers.  Libardo buys from the farmers on credit since he does not have enough capital to buy in cash.  But he wants to change this situation because the farmers sometimes need cash to cover their own expenses.

For ten years he has been involved in agriculture which he learned from his cousins when his father died.  He was only a boy then and grew up alone with his mother so at an early age he had to work to provide for the household.  He gets up at 5:00 a.m. to have breakfast, then walks with the cows for an hour to his land where he works seven hours before returning home.  He buys his farm supplies in a village that is an hour and a half away by road, but he has to walk 30 minutes to meet the truck that will take him there.\r\n\r\nThe loan Miguel is requesting is to buy four young bulls since his cropland is covered with weeds.  He must tame the bulls and put them to work on his land which he needs for his crops.  This means he will save money since he usually has to pay for this work.  He wants two bulls to work and two for fattening.

She hopes that this loan will make it possible for her to provide the necessities for her family and improve their living situation.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":999047,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"to buy new nail polish, a pusher, a nipper and cuticle remover as new supplies used in her service","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Centro East, Allacapan, Cagayan","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":123,"posted_date":"2012-03-01T19:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-31T19:10:04Z","loan_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Cristina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":6000,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2012-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2012-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2012-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2012-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2012-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2012-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2012-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2012-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2012-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2012-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2012-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2012-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2012-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2012-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2012-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2012-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2012-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-03-02T08:38:25Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}}]}
