It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Marcia has worked at the Asuncion de Juigalpa Hospital for 13 years as a nurse.  Her husband is also a nurse, but he works at the Health Center of Santo Domingo.  She is asking for her ninth loan and hopes to be able to rely upon Kiva's support.  She wants to tile her living room, and since the baby is of an age to play on the floor she wants to complete this little project as soon as possible to avoid illnesses.  If there is money left over, she would like to make improvements to the bathroom.  She shares that thanks to the loans provided to her by this institution, she has been improving her house little by little, building a kitchen and tiling the bedrooms and the dining room.\r\n<br

Later, she started selling cosmetics and apparel as a street vendor in Managua. With the profits she earned, she started making nacatamales (Central American tamales), vigoron (traditional Nicaraguan fast food), and vaho (a mix of meat, green plantains and yuca cooked in banana leaves) on weekends. She then opted to take out a loan and invested it in purchasing more apparel, footwear, and cosmetics to sell them from home.

Inici\u00f3 su actividad de vender almuerzos hace tres a\u00f1os; inicialmente elaboraba la comida en su casa vendi\u00e9ndola a sus vecinos, hasta que uno de ellos le comentara que donde \u00e9l trabajaba no hab\u00eda quien vendiera almuerzos; fue as\u00ed como Margarita se instal\u00f3 en la Zona Industrial de Mamonal, lugar cercano a Cartagena que concentra  muchas empresas importantes del pa\u00eds. En ese momento  prest\u00f3 un dinero para comprar la materia prima y preparar los almuerzos, que requer\u00eda ser devuelto al d\u00eda siguiente. \nPoco a poco fue creciendo su clientela y como el negocio ameritaba una inyecci\u00f3n de capital, se acerc\u00f3 a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, organizaci\u00f3n a la que le agradece haberle dado la oportunidad de sacarlo adelante, aumentar un poco su ingreso y reemplazar el pr\u00e9stamo que deb\u00eda devolver al d\u00eda siguiente.

R. is a businesswoman from Cartagena who has ambitious goals for her food business; she hopes it will grow to such an extent that her products will be known city-wide and that, some day, she will be recognized as one of Colombia\u2019s greatest businesswomen.  \r\n\r\nShe started her business selling breakfasts three years ago.  Initially, she made the meals at home and sold them to her neighbors until one of them mentioned to her that where he worked there was no one selling meals.  This was how Margarita set herself up in the Mamonal Industrial Zone, a site near Cartagena that concentrates many of the country\u2019s important companies.  She borrowed money that had to be repaid the next day to buy raw materials and prepare the lunches.\r\n\r\nGradually, her customer base grew.  Since the business needed an injection of capital, she called upon Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, an organization to which she is grateful for giving her the opportunity to launch her business, to increase her income a bit, and to replace the money for that loan she needed to repay the next day.\r\n\r\nThis $2.000.000 loan is her second one and she will use it to buy ingredients for her meals as well as tables and chairs for her business.\r\n\r\nBecause the Fundaci\u00f3n has supported her both financially and personally, she feels very loyal to it.  Her previous loans helped her increase her profits and to expand her service area in her type of work with better quality service; she has two employees and she is happy because she is generating income in other homes like hers.\r\n\r\nMargarita considers her greatest challenge to be having to face life alone with her three children.  However, thanks to God she was able to overcome and today she is happy knowing that she is making the effort for her children to advance.  She has taught them that life isn\u2019t easy but that with effort, dedication and lots of love, one can reach one\u2019s goals.\r\n\r\nThis is her lesson.  It helps her to face difficulties as part of life and business.  For example, when sales are down and they barely produce sufficient income to meet basic needs of her family and her business, she forges ahead even if she has to delay reaching her dreams because she knows that the first priority must be to reinvest in her business so that she can be sure to provide for her family\u2019s support.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan,

Katherine is a young woman, who is the mother of a seven-year-old son.  \r\n\r\nShe started her business in 2008 with just her knowledge, a hair wash sink, three chairs and few work tools, but lots of desire to succeed.\r\nIn an attempt to find a better location for her business, where potentially there would be more customers, she moved to another neighborhood: Ciudadela 20 D. Julio.  Today, she operates there with four permanent employees.  She is very well-known because of her good work and she is happy because she does the work she loves:  she sells beauty, harmony and self-image.\r\n\r\nShe is asking for her first loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, valued at $2,300.000 to diversify the services she offers because she wants to set up a cosmetology salon and must buy fixed assets like:  facials tables, make-up chairs, children\u2019s chairs and special spa equipment to do facial scrubs, cleanings, massages, etc.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to have a well-equipped spa and later on to buy a location for it.  Her greatest challenge is to improve her family\u2019s standard of living, to proviD. formal education for her son, and to be the owner of the locale where her beauty salon is located because she does well thanks to her dedication and persistent effort.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva

C. has sold groceries for the last year and a half.  Her store is called \u201cGabriela\u201d and it is located in her home, which is in Colonia La Concepci\u00f3n in the city of Danl\u00ed.  Sara has won over her customers with good service and affordable prices.  Her store has a pleasant appearance and the area where it is located has an agreeable ambience.\r\n\r\nWilmer Omar A. M. is a merchant; his main product is hot-dogs.  He has been in this particular line of work for a year selling his product from a hot-dog cart called \u201cCl\u00e1sicos Delicia.\u201d Mr. A. starts his business after the noon hour and he already has several spots where he sets himself up to sell.  Every day, in the afternoon, he sets up at \u201cLubricentros Romero,\u201d a place where lots of people come to have the oil in their vehicles changed and this particular \u201clubricentro\u201d is the busiest in Danl\u00ed. Wilmer also goes twice a week to sell at the tobacco factories, especially on pay day, which is Friday.  At nightfall, he can be found in Colonia La Concepci\u00f3n\u2019s main street.  He is asking for funding because his business is quite profitable; he is looking to get a second hot-dog cart and hiring someone to operate it under his supervision.\r\n\r\nMayra Lorena G. L. has sold new clothing for two years; she sells both at home and door-to-door.   Mayra has two main locations that she frequents to sell:  the village of Pataste, La Cebadilla and her own neighborhood.  Mrs. G. has won over regular customers thanks to her affordable prices and the easy payment plans she offers; most of her sales are on credit and, when she goes to the places where she sells to collect, she also sells new merchandise.\r\n\r\nJusta Elena G. L. sells popsicles, chocolate-covered bananas and juices; she has been in this line of work for two years.  She related to us that the business has been very helpful to her because she was able to use the profits to buy a refrigerator.   She sells her products from home.  Her customers prefer her because of the exquisite flavor of her popsicles.  During the school year, Elena takes a cooler full of her product to sell at the neighborhood school; she does very well here and she told us that often students will forego buying other snacks in order to enjoy her products.  Currently, Elena does not have sufficient funds to get the ingredients she needs to make her popsicles and to buy the juices.  Since the school year is about to begin, she wants to be able to meet the demand of all her customers thus, the reason behind this request for funds.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1350,"image":{"id":495426,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy ingredients and supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Danli","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.033333 -86.583333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":118,"posted_date":"2010-02-25T00:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sara Melissa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wilmer Omar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mayra Lorena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Justa Elena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":26000,"loan_amount":1350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3250},{"due_date":"2010-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3250},{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3250},{"due_date":"2010-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3250},{"due_date":"2010-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3250},{"due_date":"2010-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3250},{"due_date":"2010-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3250},{"due_date":"2010-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.75},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.75},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.75},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.75},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.75},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.75},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.75},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":168.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":168.75,"local_amount":3250,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:53:07Z","rounded_local_amount":3279.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129010793,"comment":null},{"amount":168.75,"local_amount":3250,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:04:36Z","rounded_local_amount":3279.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136735157,"comment":null},{"amount":168.75,"local_amount":3250,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:56:16Z","rounded_local_amount":3279.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144768614,"comment":null},{"amount":201.2,"local_amount":3875,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-16T07:49:00Z","rounded_local_amount":3909.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152086056,"comment":null},{"amount":136.3,"local_amount":2625,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-16T09:17:06Z","rounded_local_amount":2648.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159799897,"comment":null},{"amount":136.3,"local_amount":2625,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:53:08Z","rounded_local_amount":2648.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166905038,"comment":null},{"amount":168.75,"local_amount":3250,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:37:22Z","rounded_local_amount":3279.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172172903,"comment":null},{"amount":136.3,"local_amount":2625,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:58:32Z","rounded_local_amount":2648.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177468949,"comment":null},{"amount":54.52,"local_amount":1050,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:31:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1059.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182607411,"comment":null},{"amount":10.38,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2011-01-01T07:59:59Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-19T10:20:56Z","rounded_local_amount":201.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189189198,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-02-28T14:24:52Z","paid_date":"2011-01-19T10:20:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":179917,"name":"Yadira","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Yadira tiene 51 a\u00f1os de edad, esta Se\u00f1ora tiene una gran personalidad por lo que el carisma que ofrece a sus clientes es el mejor y esto les atrae mucho.

They are in elementary and preschool respectively. Currently he lives with Mrs. Yessi who helps him with his home expenses. Previously Larry had a loan from KIVA that helped with the construction of a room for his daughters. Now he is asking for his sixth loan. He hopes to continue his relationship with KIVA. He would like to install tile at the entrance of his house. Currently the location has dirt. He would like a door for the living room in order to give his home more security. Since the couple both work during the day the house is empty during this time. Anyone could come to his house and rob it using some effort. He is thankful for the credit that they have financed.

She is requesting a loan of 1,000,000 COP, which she plans to invest in the purchase of blankets, towels, men's and women's clothing, and the natural supplements that her clients have ordered. Adalicia started her business in 1998 after her spouse lost his job at a business where he worked for more than 10 years. She took part of his severance pay and with the goal of improving her household's income, she invested it in stat-up supplies and sold them to her neighbors. Later she extended the business to other neighborhoods of Barranquilla and also attracted the same customers with another activity: offering cellular and land-line calling services, which also attracts workers and people whom her husband has recommended. She is currently working vigilantly to improve her solvency as all these activities converge so she can cover household expenses and further expand her small business. Adalicia dreams of her two married children  having their own homes and also hopes to add internet services to her business, which her customers have suggested. She plans on adding it in the near future. Taking into account that her neighborhood, the April 7th barrio, holds soccer tournaments on the field just out front of her home, there is a lot of commercial potential in her area. Her current challenge is caring for her mother, who lately has faced health and language difficulties, which combined with all her business and household activities have tested the strength of Adalicia, who is a great woman.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":492924,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchase blankets, towels, men's and women's clothing, and natural supplements","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2010-02-25T01:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adalicia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":84009},{"due_date":"2010-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":93286},{"due_date":"2010-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":95073},{"due_date":"2010-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":96896},{"due_date":"2010-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":98753},{"due_date":"2010-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":100646},{"due_date":"2010-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":102575},{"due_date":"2010-11-06T07:00:00Z","amount":104541},{"due_date":"2010-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":106544},{"due_date":"2011-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":117677}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.1},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.98},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.91},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.87},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.85},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.84},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.85},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.88},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.94},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.78}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":44.78,"local_amount":85286,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:33:01Z","rounded_local_amount":86125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136677864,"comment":null},{"amount":48.99,"local_amount":93310,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:18:57Z","rounded_local_amount":94227.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144712244,"comment":null},{"amount":49.93,"local_amount":95098,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:47:36Z","rounded_local_amount":96033.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151895745,"comment":null},{"amount":50.88,"local_amount":96921,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:12:08Z","rounded_local_amount":97874.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159636072,"comment":null},{"amount":51.86,"local_amount":98779,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:17:15Z","rounded_local_amount":99750.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166850169,"comment":null},{"amount":52.85,"local_amount":100672,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:08:12Z","rounded_local_amount":101662.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172116935,"comment":null},{"amount":53.87,"local_amount":102602,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:01:04Z","rounded_local_amount":103611.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177410803,"comment":null},{"amount":54.12,"local_amount":103111,"processed_date":"2010-11-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:08:20Z","rounded_local_amount":104125.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182550461,"comment":null},{"amount":55.94,"local_amount":106544,"processed_date":"2010-12-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:13:56Z","rounded_local_amount":107592.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188688067,"comment":null},{"amount":61.78,"local_amount":117677,"processed_date":"2011-01-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:38:35Z","rounded_local_amount":118834.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191427311,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-02-26T19:48:49Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T03:38:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":179923,"name":"Nancy Elizabeth","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Nancy C. de 23 a\u00f1os, vive en una zona urbana en el Suburbio de Guayaquil, su casa es de cemento cuenta con agua y luz como servicio b\u00e1sicos.

She works with the help of her mother every day from 7 a.m. until 9 p.m., selling peanuts at a $1.50 a pound, garbanzo beans at $1.30 a pound and mat\u00e9 at $.50 a pound. One of the inconveniences is the amount of competition she has. With the loan, she plans to purchase grains, oils and shampoo for her business. One of her dreams is to have more stores to sell grains with employees.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva

Azogues and Ca\u00f1ar are famous for its craftwork, especially for making straw hats and ceramic products. The people are cordial and very kind, including the community bank members who work hard every day to provide a better present and future to their family. Martha lives in the community of Zhizhiquin with her husband, who works at a sawmill they own, and their four children, ages 13, 11, 8 and 5, who are all in school. Together they have been able to build their own home through a lot of hard work and sacrifice. Martha has helped her husband at the sawmill for the past three years and also dedicates herself to household chores and caring for a cow they own. She heard about the benefits of community banks from a friend who was a member, and has since taken out 10 loans, which has helped her grown her business. With the new loan she is requesting, she plans to purchase wood so she has an adequate supply for her customers. Her dream is to grow her business every day.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":493823,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Timber Sales","sector":"Construction","use":"Purchase wood to have a sufficient supply","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-02-25T02:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Martha Yolanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1100,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":91.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":183.34,"local_amount":183.34,"processed_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:00:20Z","rounded_local_amount":183.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128946461,"comment":null},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":91.67,"processed_date":"2010-03-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:00:39Z","rounded_local_amount":91.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128946462,"comment":null},{"amount":275.01,"local_amount":275.01,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:18:43Z","rounded_local_amount":275.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136674740,"comment":null},{"amount":183.34,"local_amount":183.34,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:17:09Z","rounded_local_amount":183.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144708901,"comment":null},{"amount":183.34,"local_amount":183.34,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:46:52Z","rounded_local_amount":183.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151892198,"comment":null},{"amount":183.3,"local_amount":183.3,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:38Z","rounded_local_amount":183.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159632608,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-02-26T01:21:05Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":179927,"name":"Porfirio Margarito","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Porfirio A. es un caballero muy trabajador que se dedica a la crianza de ganado en el municipio El Sauce en Le\u00f3n donde tiene su familia compuesta por su c\u00f3nyuge e hijos.\nActualmente el se\u00f1or Porfirio est\u00e1 solicitando un cr\u00e9dito para invertirlo directamente en la compra de ganado espec\u00edficamente en la compra de novillos para sacarles el m\u00e1ximo provecho y de esta manera obtener los ingresos para el mantenimiento de su amada familia que tanto depende de \u00e9l.\n","en":"Porfirio A. is a hardworking gentleman who raises livestock in the town of El Sauce in Le\u00f3n where he has his family, composed of his wife and children.  \r\n\r\nCurrently Porfirio is requesting a loan to invest directly in the purchase of livestock.

Olga is requesting the loan to purchase more supplies to make her pastries since she has been taking very large orders and she is not set up for it.

He buys his goods wholesale and sells retail to residents of his community.  Because of the wide variety of goods in his shop, customers are encouraged to continue buying from him.

Boakai is a high-school graduate but could not continue his education beyond that due to a lack of financial support.\r\n<p>\r\nHe and his family live in the Cow Factory Community, Jamaica Road, on the outskirts of Liberia's capital, Monrovia. He sells from a table on Randall Street in central downtown Monrovia. Boakai\u2019s business is the sale of cosmetics. He buys wholesale and sells retail to customers. He has been running this business for more than 5 years and hopes to become a big business man.\r\n\r\nBoakai started by selling children's toys with funds given to him by his mother. In his business, he faces the challenge of a shortage of funds to use as working capital. He encourages customers by selling quality goods, and a good manner of approach.

As her home is far from the center of the city it is difficult for her to go to banks in search of loans. Luckily, CIDRE took the initiative to go to her area and discovered that there were many small producers of raw milk in the area who were having problems because the price of feed for milk cows had increased in the last month due to poor weather conditions in Bolivia. Therefore, Francisca will use this loan to purchase feed for her dairy cows so that they do not suffer from a lack of food and their production will not be affected. \r\n\r\nFrancisca's dream is to

Jilo, the Dreamers of Jilo, because they are all from Jilotepec, Mexico and share the idea that to them, microcredit is like a dream that gives them the opportunity to grow and create a better future for themselves and their children.  The group is composed of 10 women.  This is their first time requesting a loan from CrediCom\u00fan.\r\n\r\nBibiana S. Aveda\u00f1o is the president of the group.  She is 26 years old and went to school to become a beautician.  She works as a stylist and has a 7-year-old daughter.  She started her own business 9 years ago.  Bibiana is requesting a loan to purchase hair dyes, peroxides, machines and accessories for her business.\r\n\r\nMartha D. Jes\u00fas B., known as \"Martita,\" is 46 years old and completed her schooling until the 6th graD..  She is a vendor and has two children - a daughter and a son.  Two years ago, she started selling fruit cocktails and tupperware.  She is requesting a loan to purchase fruits and disposable containers for the fruit cocktails she sells.  Martita begins her work at 5 am everyday.  She prepares the fruit and leaves her house to sell the cocktails from her cart on the street.  She also uses her time outsiD. to show people her catalogue of tupperware.  In this way, she can attend to both of her businesses at the same time.\r\n\r\nMartita, just like everyone she knows, lives day-to-day in a constant fight for survival and for the improvement of her situation.  She has been the primary breadwinner for her household ever since her husband began to progressively lose his vision some time back.  His loss of vision went unexplained until a few weeks ago, when he was diagnosed with diabetes.  Due to the effects of the disease, he is no longer able to work.  Martita's son is studying for his degree and also working, since his mother's earnings are insufficient to support the household and pay for his education.  Martita is afraid because she does not want her son to quit his studies to work full-time.  \r\n\r\nAlthough there have been moments of frustration in her life, they have not stopped Martita from continuing her struggle for a better future.  She is very enthusiastic about her loan request because it will help her to expand her business and at the same time obtain larger profits and a better income for her home.  She is requesting this loan so she can continue to sell her fruit cocktails and possibly open a fixed locale, hopefully in the near future.  A more permanent location would enable her to continue her sales without having to endure the weather conditions and would also give her the possibility of employing her family members.<br

In the future she wants to have employees at the bakery so she can have her own beauty salon.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":495537,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase flour, sugar and butter","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Guayaquil (Fortin)","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":147,"posted_date":"2010-02-25T03:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tatiana Marcela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":60.33},{"due_date":"2010-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":74.13},{"due_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":75.25},{"due_date":"2010-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":77.81},{"due_date":"2010-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":79.14},{"due_date":"2010-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":81.15},{"due_date":"2010-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":83.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":85.35},{"due_date":"2010-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":87.83},{"due_date":"2010-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":89.75},{"due_date":"2011-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":92.04},{"due_date":"2011-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":113.55}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.13},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.25},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.81},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.14},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.15},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.35},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.83},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.75},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.04},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":60.33,"local_amount":60.33,"processed_date":"2010-03-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:59:55Z","rounded_local_amount":60.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128945758,"comment":null},{"amount":74.13,"local_amount":74.13,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:16:27Z","rounded_local_amount":74.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144708278,"comment":null},{"amount":75.25,"local_amount":75.25,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:46:11Z","rounded_local_amount":75.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151891475,"comment":null},{"amount":156.95,"local_amount":156.95,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:04Z","rounded_local_amount":156.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159631728,"comment":null},{"amount":81.15,"local_amount":81.15,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:14:17Z","rounded_local_amount":81.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166845613,"comment":null},{"amount":0.19,"local_amount":0.19,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:06:14Z","rounded_local_amount":0.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172111896,"comment":null},{"amount":168.83,"local_amount":168.83,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:56:47Z","rounded_local_amount":168.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177405307,"comment":null},{"amount":87.83,"local_amount":87.83,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:08:04Z","rounded_local_amount":87.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188680562,"comment":null},{"amount":89.75,"local_amount":89.75,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T01:45:52Z","rounded_local_amount":89.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191378913,"comment":null},{"amount":92.04,"local_amount":92.04,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-25T09:11:14Z","rounded_local_amount":92.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195796918,"comment":null},{"amount":113.55,"local_amount":113.55,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-16T08:11:13Z","rounded_local_amount":113.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201240350,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-02-25T11:04:47Z","paid_date":"2011-04-16T08:11:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":179997,"name":"Alfredo Alejandro","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El joven Alfredo Alejandro A.

A. is 24 years and single. He is attending the University of Cochabamba in hopes of finishing his degree in business administration. He owns an internet cafe located in central Cochabamba and currently has five computers, which helps him make enough to be able to live and pay for his studies. Alfredo is requesting this loan so he can purchase another computer and update the ones he already has, since with his knowledge of computers he can update them in little time. Alfredo is known as a very hard-working and studious person with an interest in moving up in life. Social instability in Cochabamba (road blocks, public transportation stoppages, demonstrations and political differences) is a problem, and the biggest risk for his business is if there is not a free movement of people nobody will come to his internet cafe.

G. is the leader of a group of five borrowers called Barclay Farm United.  He is 26 years old, married, and has two girls.  One of his girls is six years old and is in the 1st grade, the other is 3 months old.  F. and his family live in the Barclay Farm Community in Harbel, about 40 miles from the capital of Liberia, Monrovia.  He also helps care for two of his siblings who live with him, and regularly sends money to his parents who are farmers in Lofa County in northwest Liberia.\r\n\r\nF. currently attends night school, and is enrolled in the 11th grade.  His education was interrupted by the Liberian civil war, when his family went to neighboring Guinea to escape the fighting.  He sells hardware and tools from a stall at the Harbel Market, which is located on the Firestone Rubber Plantation.  Firestone's plantation in Liberia is one of the largest in the world, with a million acres under long-term lease from the Liberian government.\r\n\r\nF. says he started his business with 4,000 Liberian dollars in seed money from his father.  He originally sold tools and hardware from a wheelbarrow, but thanks to his hard work and perseverance he has been able to move up to selling at the market.  He hopes to move his shop to a storefront one day soon.  With his 6,000 Liberian dollar portion of this 30,000 Liberian dollar group loan, F. plans to buy more inventory for his business, such as nails, cutlasses (machetes), shovels, and hammers.\r\n\r\nF. credits his success in business to selling quality items and treating his customers well.  In future, he wants to have more children and hopes to be able to send them all to school so they get a good education.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the photo that accompanies this profile, F. is the one holding the sign.

His business is made possible because the conditions allow him to make good use of the natural resources at his disposal.

Hilda M. is 32 years old and a single woman with four children.  She operates a dairy and lives in an area of Maica Norte, which is a canton of the city of Cochabamba.  Hilda has to raise her children alone because her husband abandoned them a year ago after she became severely ill and had to be hospitalized for six months.  Hilda\u2019s mother stayed with the children while she was in the hospital.  Her fifteen year old daughter quit high school and began working so that she could help her mother recover and pay for the household expenses.  Their bills were numerous since there was no other income besides the milk being sold by Hilda\u2019s mother and children.  After she was discharged from the hospital, Hilda felt guilty that her daughter had to quit school to help her and her children experienced a strong rejection by their father.  Hilda advised them not to mention him again, as if he were dead.\r\n<p>\r\nHilda is requesting a loan to buy two more dairy cows so that she can increase milk production for delivery and to make cheeses to sell at the market.  She feels she has more courage and strength to move her children forward so that they can complete their education.  Her daughter returned to school, but she still helps with gathering the milk and helping her mother in the afternoons make cheeses.  Hilda hopes to improve her income and experience a better standard of living now that they she hasn't accumulated as many expenses as she had a year ago.\r\n<p>\r\nHilda\u2019s mother is very proud of her daughter and granddaughter for persevering and not giving in to everything bad that had happened to them.   Do\u00f1a Carmen (Hilda\u2019s mother) says, \u201cI know my granddaughter will experience success because my daughter will be the one to show her.\u201d\r\n<p>\r\nHilda is still in the process of recovery, but she continues to work hard and manage her dairy responsibly.  She begins work at 4am and then prepares her children for school so that they can become professionals and have a better future than her.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica,

The new school year is about to start, though, and she wants to buy the ingredients and supplies she needs to ramp up her business.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":495651,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","use":"Buy supplies for snacks business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"San Lorenzo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.416667 -87.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":118,"posted_date":"2010-02-25T15:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gloria Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":8000,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.13},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.12},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.13},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.12},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.13},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.12},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.13},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":53.13,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:53:29Z","rounded_local_amount":1032.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129010802,"comment":null},{"amount":53.12,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:04:43Z","rounded_local_amount":1032.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136735174,"comment":null},{"amount":53.13,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:56:21Z","rounded_local_amount":1032.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144768631,"comment":null},{"amount":53.12,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-16T07:49:04Z","rounded_local_amount":1032.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152086073,"comment":null},{"amount":53.13,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-16T09:16:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1032.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159799914,"comment":null},{"amount":53.12,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:52:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1032.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166905055,"comment":null},{"amount":106.25,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:37:02Z","rounded_local_amount":2064.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172172918,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

Tiene 49 a\u00f1os y tres hijos entre las edades de 18 y 27 a\u00f1os. Maneja un taller de joyer\u00eda de reparaci\u00f3n y producci\u00f3n de joyas. Le gusta su arte y se dedica a dise\u00f1ar joyas, hacer ba\u00f1os de oro, ba\u00f1os de plata, enchapes en oro y en n\u00edquel. Este es su primer cr\u00e9dito con la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, organizaci\u00f3n que le recomend\u00f3  un amigo que tambi\u00e9n participa en sus programas.  Nelson aplica en la actualidad a un cr\u00e9dito por valor de de $1.300.000, que invertir\u00e1 en materia prima para la joyer\u00eda como plata y oro y un surtido de  accesorios, m\u00e1s grande para su vitrina.\nNelson comenz\u00f3 con la joyer\u00eda hace m\u00e1s de treinta a\u00f1os, cuando en su barrio trabaj\u00f3 este arte con un amigo joyero  durante 15 a\u00f1os,  hasta que Nelson se independizara y montara el suyo propio. Originalmente trabajaba en el centro de Barranquilla, pero se fue para el centro de Soledad hace 10 a\u00f1os por que tiene su mejor clientela y tambi\u00e9n porque el centro comercial en que ten\u00eda su negocio se iba decayendo. En los \u00faltimos 16 a\u00f1os con su taller independiente manifiesta que su negocio ha sido estable, pero que esta estabilidad ha sido su mayor desaf\u00edo debido a la  falta de recursos y apoyo,  tal como el que le ofrece  la Fundaci\u00f3n a trav\u00e9s de este financiamiento. M\u00e1s adelante, quiere progresar en su negocio y tener la oportunidad de emplear a m\u00e1s personas, pues su   segundo hijo es el \u00fanico que en la actualidad trabaja con \u00e9l.\n","en":"Nelson Edgardo M. C. has shown great tenacity in the face of adversity.  Despite a traffic accident three years ago that cost him his left arm, he never stopped playing billiards at a high level.  So high a level, in fact, that he was the representative of the Colombian \"departamento\" of Atlantico at the national Paralympic games in Cali in October 2008.  Nelson is 49 years old and has three children between the ages of 18 and 27.  He operates a workshop, making and repairing jewelry.  He likes the work: designing jewelry, making gold and silver plating, plating jewelry in gold and nickle.  This is his first Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo loan.  A friend recommended that he apply and he's asking for a $1,300,000 loan so that he can buy supplies--silver, gold, etc.--for his workshop.\r\n\r\nNelson began working with jewelry more than thirty years ago, working for 15 years with a friend who was a jeweler and then setting up his own business.  He used to work in Barranquilla, but he left for Soledad 10 years ago because there's a better pool of customers and because the shopping area where he had his business before had declined.  He says that his business has been stable for the last 16 years but he's suffered from a lack of resources and support, something that the Fundacion can remedy with this loan.  In the future, he wants to grow the business and add new employees.  For now, his second son is his only employee.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva

P\u00e1ez is 61 years old and has six children. She lives in the neighbourhood of Villa Gloria which is located in the south west of the city of Barranquilla. It was once a shanty town but now has public services and many bus companies.\r\n\r\nA year ago Fedelina started designing, making, and selling footwear, specializing in shoes for women. She sells them to customers who live in the Urab\u00e1 area and personally delivers the orders to the people who sell the footwear. A colleague looks after the payments and bank deposits. Fedelina also sells in Barranquilla, in her own neighbourhood, and in the surrounding areas.\r\n\r\nShe is now asking for a loan of $1,500 to buy materials and supplies to make footwear, such as leather, stick-on soles, and thread because she needs complete her customers\u2019 orders. \r\n\r\nThis is Fedelina\u2019s fifth loan with Kiva parter, the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, to which she has belonged for more than three years. With the Foundation\u2019s help, she built up working capital for developing the business, and as a result was able to make improvements to her house. Her dream is to build one place for making the products and another for displaying them. She also wishes for the financial wellbeing of her children and grandchildren through education, and for a greater income from her business. Her most important challenge is to separate the living quarters of the family from the workshop area because the business takes up a lot of space. This creates problems for the family and isn\u2019t good for the children who live there.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jane Agg, Kiva

Instead, his wife, Mrs. Chanra K., received the loan for him. The photo above is of Mr. Buntheng S.'s wife.

She is married with five children aged between 3 and 16 years. All her children go to school. The family owns a four-room house where she lives with eight other people. She takes care of additional family members.  The family has access to electricity but no running water at home.  The family has three meals a day. Her greatest monthly expenses include: utility bills, school fees for her children, medication and food. \r\n\r\nSofia operates a retail shop selling all kinds of merchandise in Ndeeba. She serves an average of 30 customers a day, and has had this business for over twenty years.  Sofia buys her merchandise from shops in Kikuubo, one of the busiest places in Kampala.  Thus she incurs transport costs to go to Kikuubo and to bring her goods back. Her main business challenges are defaulters, the rainy season (because she works from a muddy place) and the ever-increasing prices of merchandise.\r\n\r\nSofia has been with MCDT for over nine years.  She is requesting her twentieth loan with the same group mates. She wants to use this loan to buy more bags of sugar, cartons of salt, boxes of soap and jerrycans of cooking oil. She hopes to grow her business and start selling at wholesale prices only.

The official name of this borrowing group is Virginia C.'s Group.\r\n\r\nVirginia is married and has three school-aged children.

Virginia is requesting a loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase livestock to raise and sell in the future. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Virginia from ASKI.

The loan will be used to buy a ton of potato seeds.  \r\n\r\nAysha, 58, is a widow. She has four children. Her youngest son lives with her. He is a farmer. Aysha is a schoolteacher, working in that school more than 35 years. Her loan will be used to buy a few sheep and fodder for her animals. \r\n\r\nKaramat is 65 years old. Though it looks like she is old, she is young in mind! She is a very active woman who spends a lot of time taking care of her nine children and dozens of grandchildren. She is a pensioner. Her family rents land where they raise corn, sunflower and vegetables. She will use the loan to buy potato seeds and fertilizer for the upcoming sowing season. \r\n\r\nO. Gulayim is 51 year old, a middle age woman. She has four children. She raised them all herself because she divorced many years ago. Two sons are in Russia at the present time, because in rural places it is very difficult to find proper jobs here. She has her own land where she has been raising vegetables since 1990. The elder son looks after the vegetables and also fattens a few cattle.\r\n\r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

When Jocelyn decided to join ASHI, she first asked her husband for his opinion.  With her husband\u2019s approval, she joined the group of five women in their village who have the same intention as hers. After she was recognized as a member, she submitted her request for a loan, which she will use to purchase a hog\/pig for fattening. After four months of raising her hog\/pig, she will be able to see her profit because by then, the hog will be sold either live or slaughtered. Once it is sold, Jocelyn will get her capital from it and will again buy another hog.  With that opportunity, Jocelyn feels happy that through the ASHI and Kiva partnership, there is a possibility for her to be funded with a much larger amount of loans in the future to be able to really grow her business.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

Ismatillo is a 56-year-old married man who lives with his daughter and owns a small farm.

Since cattle raising and selling is profitable, Ismatillo has become a very successful businessman.\r\n\r\nIsmatillo has a friendly family which is always trying to help one another. Thus, his wife and daughter help him with his cattle raising business. He works very hard and spends his weekend time with the cattle, cleaning them, feeding and pasturing. \r\n\r\nNow Ismatillo wants to expand his business and buy more cattle, so he applied for a loan of $1500. He promises to repay the loan in time and thanks all lenders for their support.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Muzaffar is 40 years old. He is married and has three children of school age. His wife is a teacher in a secondary school. \r\n\r\nMuzaffar manufactures national cradles. National cradles in Tajikistan are very colorful. They are made of wood. As a rule, the national cradle is presented by the grandparents when the baby is forty days old, and this event is celebrated by the entire family. \r\n\r\nMuzaffar has been in this business for seventeen years. His wife helps him. The completed cradles are purchased from their house. The stability of the business allows a steady income which ensures that the family has the possibility of improving their living conditions.\r\n\r\nMuzaffar has been working with IMON for four years. For the entire period of time he has shown himself as a successful client, managing his loans with accuracy and precision. Today Muzaffar requests a loan in the amount of $1500 in order to purchase more planks and paints for producing more cradles. \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n \r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n \r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n \r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n \r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n \r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n \r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
