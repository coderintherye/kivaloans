A. is a 77-year-old single woman. Twelve years ago, she opened herself up to taking the risk of venturing in a business through the motivation of her business partner Rita, who is now 80 years of age. The two had their own share of a small amount of capital to start a business of buying and selling salt and \u201cmuscovado\u201d sugar. They have a small table made of bamboo in the market to sell their products to people. \r\n\r\n\u201cMucovado\u201d is a variety of sugar which is commonly called the \u201cred\" sugar. It is processed naturally and free from any chemicals and preservatives. This is supposedly the most expensive kind of sugar, wherein customers are people from class A and B. However, in the province where the supply of this is abundant and the sellers' packaging and marketing strategies are very poor, the demand in the market is low. Middlemen buy large volume and are the ones to improve the packaging for export, selling in other cities through malls. Therefore, they\u2019re the ones who gain bigger profit.  \r\n\r\nDespite Victoria\u2019s age, she still has hopes to improve the packaging of her business and to increase her sales turnover. With that, she will have more profits and her dream of helping some of her relatives would be materialized.

In his 14 year checkered history overseeing his brick-laying and sand-quarry businesses, he has been brought to terms with the requisite virtues that are needed to make successful headway in firmly establishing a business niche. \r\n\r\nA lot of sacrifices have to be made to get that leeway, especially when one is an upstart businessperson. An unwavering sense of purpose, hard work and determination are vital means to achieving one\u2019s ends in any business, according to this affable and buoyant gentleman. He also points out that a belief in one\u2019s abilities is paramount.\r\n\r\nThe vestiges of his first business experience can be traced to his erstwhile diary and still existing retail enterprise. These two businesses were both gotten off their feet with a lot of persuasion from friends. \r\n\r\nIn Bukasa, his sand and brick products are in high demand. This he attributes to the good rapport he has created with his customers. These customers return the favor by bringing in other customers. He says it is mostly middle-class people constructing family homes who are his clients. \r\n\r\nThe happily married father of four says he has made profitable use of his businesses. In a month, his balance sheet profits add to 400,000 shillings. He also still ekes out side profits from his retail shop. Educating all his children to higher institutions of learning is his highest priority for now and the future. With this loan, he is upbeat that he will be in a much stronger financial position to buy more firewood that he requires to bake his bricks.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1375,"image":{"id":568975,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bricks","sector":"Construction","use":"To buy more firewood for baking his bricks","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Mukono","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.25 32.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2010-07-17T05:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mukono Edward","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julius","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ronald","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Robinah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Molly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patrick","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bosco","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margaret","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":3100000,"loan_amount":1375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":193750},{"due_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":193750},{"due_date":"2010-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":193750},{"due_date":"2010-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":193750},{"due_date":"2010-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":193750},{"due_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":193750},{"due_date":"2010-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":193750},{"due_date":"2010-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":193750},{"due_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":193750},{"due_date":"2010-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":193750},{"due_date":"2010-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":193750},{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":193750},{"due_date":"2010-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":193750},{"due_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":193750},{"due_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":193750},{"due_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":193750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.94},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.94},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.93},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.94},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.94},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.94},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.93},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.94},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.94},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.94},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.93},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.94},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.94},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.94},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.93},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.94}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":325.28,"local_amount":733350,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:46:59Z","rounded_local_amount":733497.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159689451,"comment":null},{"amount":420.2,"local_amount":947350,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:47:33Z","rounded_local_amount":947541,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166903598,"comment":null},{"amount":371.71,"local_amount":838050,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T09:15:32Z","rounded_local_amount":838218.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172297071,"comment":null},{"amount":257.81,"local_amount":581250,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:36:09Z","rounded_local_amount":581367.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177467346,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-07-17T11:03:56Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T15:36:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":215070,"name":"Gradi Plus Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Adolphine W. is the leader of the Community Bank named \u201cGradi Plus\u201d which is composed of 31 members united in solidarity for receiving Kiva loans with the goal of developing their businesses.\r\n\r\nAdolphine has been part of the micro-enterprise world since 2007.

She lives in her own home together with her husband Alejandro, 45, and their 3 adored children, to whom she wants to give a better future. When she was very small Rosa learned to work the land, as agricultural work has been in her family for many year. This activity gave her the necessary capital to establish her shop, which is giving her excellent earnings as there aren't many shops in her village, and little by little it has become her principle activity. What Rosa likes most about her job is the communication she has with her neighbours who come in to her establishment to purchase something. 5 years have passed this way, during which time she has weighed up that to have what she has achieved she has to sacrifice things and remain in her shop all day. With time Rosa hopes to expand her shop's facilities to provide better comfort to her customers.

M\u00e1rquez is a native of Ovejas in the Montes de Mar\u00eda subregion, in the department of Sucre in the Colombian Caribbean. This area is known for its bagpipe festival and the fertility of its land. As he himself says of his home town, \"It's easy to visit and hard to forget.\"\r\n\r\nFor the last 23 years, before which he worked as shift leader in a brush factory, he has done a little of everything: fumigation services, painting, furniture upholstery (as he can weave grasses to make those famous Momp\u00f3s chairs) and assistant accountant. He is currently working at selling beef, chicken, fruit and dairy products, which he brings from his municipality to Soledad, where he lives with his spouse and his children, one of whom is an interior designer. \r\n\r\nThis is his third loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and he is requesting a total of $2.000.000 COP. Freddy A. M\u00e1rquez says that these loans have been a great help, because he has been able to increase his income and pay for his daughter's education. In his view, a business needs two types of capital: one invested, and the other available to take advantage of the great opportunities presented by a changing market. His aim is to grow his business and cover a larger area, extending into the various neighborhoods of Barranquilla.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Alison Dent, Kiva

A., 29, lives in the La Playa urban zone.  She rents washing machines and offers Internet, transcription, printing and photocopying services.  She\u2019s married and has two children who are 6 and 9 years of age.\r\n\r\nThree years ago she became interested in having a business in addition to the fast-food business she\u2019d been involved with to date.  This is how she installed the laundry service buying first one machine then two additional ones precisely with the loan she got from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo in 2008.  She has been a client of this organization for two years and six months ago decided to buy a computer with her own resources to open a new Internet service.  In addition, she bought a printer and a photocopier. \r\n\r\nThus Aracelys has been constantly opening up new venues in her service infrastructure for which there is growing demand.  She has, therefore, decided to buy more equipment and move to a location that is near her home in order to expand even more.\r\n\r\nHer husband is a valued employee at a private firm and together they have built all they now have for their family\u2019s wellbeing.  Aracelys does not have any employees or collaborators; she runs and tends to her business by herself and manages her time in such a way to be a good wife and mother, in other words, a good family member.\r\n\r\nBecause the transcriptions she does are of such high quality, she has several customers that appreciate her kindness and good work.  Thus, she is very popular and everyone seeks her out when they need projects done.\r\n\r\nAracelys is a young woman with lots of capacity for self-improvement and an enormous willingness to work which make her most worthy of admiration.  \r\nShe is very happy working at what she knows best because she studied to be an executive secretary which makes it easier for her to manage her business and she also stays current through seminars and courses she takes constantly.\r\n\r\nThe loans that Aracelys has gotten from the Fundaci\u00f3n have been useful for her to purchase the washing machines and her profits have provided the entire infrastructure she how possesses.\r\n\r\nShe will use her latest Kiva loan to buy a computer, furniture and supplies to set up her business.  In addition, she will pay a month\u2019s rent in advance for the locale she plans to install her business in.

She plans to use this loan to invest in her business by buying shoes and electrical stuff like blenders, fans and small radios to sell by payments to her clients. She will use the profits to buy a refrigerator and school supplies for her children, and by saving she will invest in her business because she wants to improve it. She is dreaming to have enough money, health and love to share what she gets with her family and people around, and she knows with Esperanza and her group she will be able to accomplish her dreams. In the meantime she plans to continue enjoying her favorite things which are to eat and dance a lot.\r\n\r\nAlbaneli's story is representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican clients generally, many of whom recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti. Her group is located in Santiago, an area famous for tobacco and beef production, the second biggest city in the Dominican Republic.

She started to use it in her house and with people very close.  Gradually she was getting orders through referrals.  Many new customers were giving her orders and requesting new products with diverse handicraft techniques like paint on fabric.  Jeniffer kept adding things until she came to sell a diversity of designs.  Finally, she agreed to sell products by catalog. \r\n\r\nHer dream is to have a place where she can display the beautiful handicrafts that she makes day to day.

Su sue\u00f1o es llegar a tener un negocio grande distribuidor de productos de madera que venda al por mayor.","en":"Se\u00f1or Pedro Jos\u00e9 had a loan before and invested it in his business. Pedro is 52 years old, and started working as a carpenter 31 years ago. Since then his business has grown well, owing to his canny investment in the business and the long hours he puts in every day. He has a lot of orders at the moment, but due to a lack of capital he hasn't been able to satisfy all his customers. The loan will be used to buy wood, including mahogany, cedar and laurel. Pedro's dream is to grow his business into wholesale distributor of wooden products.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Rosa Oswald, Kiva

He has his own home where he lives with his wife and six children.  Ever since he was a young man, Victor has been dedicated to agriculture, growing lettuce, spinach, and aromatic herbs according to the season.  Since then farming has become a constant activity, continually applying compost and plowing the land to ensure that the crops receive the best care.  Occasionally he receives the help of his wife and children, specifically with the harvesting of his products so that they can be sold.  It is very important for Victor to continue cultivating his land and looking for sales strategies that will generate more profits.

Luisa Lavina P. S. is 56 years old and lives with her family in the neighborhood of Medardo Andino.  Her husband is an employee of MAGFOR (Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry) and contributes toward the household income.  Her grown children are working and also help with the expenses.  Luisa works as a secretary at Universidad Americana (UAM).  \r\n<p>\r\nSince her family has limited resources, Luisa is not able to finish all the necessary renovations to her house which include replacing the sheets of zinc roofing and tiling the living room floor.  For this reason, she is requesting a loan to buy the construction materials needed to complete these improvements so that her family can live in a space that is more dignified, safer, and more comfortable.  As parents, Luisa and her husband want to provide good conditions in which her children can develop.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":569410,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"Complete home improvements","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luisa Lavina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":15000,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2010-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2010-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2010-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2010-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.42},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.41},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.42},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.42},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.41},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.42},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.42},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.41},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.42},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.42},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.41},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":60.42,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2010-08-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:17:07Z","rounded_local_amount":1292.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166771200,"comment":null},{"amount":64.86,"local_amount":1342.01,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T07:45:52Z","rounded_local_amount":1387.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172205096,"comment":null},{"amount":123.96,"local_amount":2564.65,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T12:02:47Z","rounded_local_amount":2650.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177330784,"comment":null},{"amount":121.5,"local_amount":2513.85,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-19T09:10:24Z","rounded_local_amount":2598.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189098070,"comment":null},{"amount":122.21,"local_amount":2528.54,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:05:51Z","rounded_local_amount":2613.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195766322,"comment":null},{"amount":51.31,"local_amount":1061.61,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T09:58:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1097.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206078199,"comment":null},{"amount":60.79,"local_amount":1257.81,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:21:44Z","rounded_local_amount":1300.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211147289,"comment":null},{"amount":119.95,"local_amount":2481.53,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:25:52Z","rounded_local_amount":2564.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216432860,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-08-13T02:52:53Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T10:25:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":215223,"name":"Nelson Enrique","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Nelson tiene  37 a\u00f1os de edad, es casado y actualmente tiene dos hijos, uno de dos a\u00f1os y el otro de ocho meses de edad a su cargo.

She had a little working capital, 60 PEN, to start with, but this new business has been more profitable than the previous one, so she was able to buy the refrigerator that she needed.  She also uses [the refrigerator] to her advantage and makes and sells frozen, homemaD., fruit flavored popsicles.

When a harvest is good, the product is sold to market through a middleman, while some is stored for their family consumption, especially for the lean months or rainy days. During these months (from May to August), everything in the market is priced expensively, while small and poor entrepreneurs like Lovely cannot price her rice high because she has to earn in any way possible and does not have a storage room or facilities to preserve the good quality of their rice. Without any other options, the woman has to sell her rice during the peak of harvest, when supply is high and demand goes low.\n\nThe loans Lovely has accessed through her membership in ASHI since 2008 have been a great help to her family and business. When she received a small amount of capital from ASHI,she managed to put it all into her business. For her, business is an important factor, and she does not want to  be a problem for her weekly payments. The profit she gains from her business has enabled her to support  the educational needs of her five children,whose ages are from 3 to  13 years old and save some of the money to support agricultural needs for the next cropping(planting season).                                                \n\nAs parents, Lovely and her husband Vicente don\u2019t want their children to inherit their very poor kind of life someday. As much as possible, they really want all of their children to graduate from college and find a better and stable kind of job someday. In the light of this, Lovely is requesting another loan through ASHI to increase her capital investment to the business, hoping that it will grow and become more profitable.     \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":569568,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase farm inputs, such as rise seedling and fertilizers.

However, being a mother who sees the poor situation of her children and grandchildren, she is motivated to be as productive as she can to augment the lives of her loved ones. Clemente is a farmer who plants rice and vegetables on a small parcel of land they own. Norma is a support that strengthens her husband\u2019s livelihood, being the one who sells their products, and a help with their financial needs. Norma also has her own business venture with the support of her husband. Through the loans she received since she joined ASHI in 2007, she has been able to purchase coconut fruit from the landowners of a coconut land. She pays in advance and they are the ones to harvest the fruit when it is mature. With it, Norma and her husband have able to make \u201ccopra\u201d which they sell in large volume to a middleman who transports and does wholesaling to a manufacturer of coconut oil in the neighboring province. As the amount of loans she requests and receives through ASHI increases, the coconut land she has able to invest on also expands, thus making the volume of her sales grow bigger and bigger.\r\n\r\nNorma really enjoyed the business she does and her family enjoys the profit it makes. Because of this, the woman really wishes that her business would become sustainable and profitable in the future so she can employ her family members and improve their lives. With this vision, she and her husband agreed to request a much larger loan through ASHI. Since both are working so hard to grow their business and maintain a very good performance in ASHI in terms of payments and attendance at weekly center meetings, they believe that they are qualified to be trusted with the amount they are requesting.

Many rulers and country's political elites have changed over these years.  All of them tried to renew and modernize the country.  But due to the lack of political will, patience or maybe simply lack of sincerity, all of their efforts were doomed to fail.  As a result, no new manufacturing sites were built in Kyrgyzstan, and those that existed stopped functioning.  Under these conditions, the cleverest people understood that their own business will save them from unemployment.\r\n\r\nRaima J. is the leader of this group.  She is fifty-two years old.  Raima and her husband raised two children.  The oldest son is twenty-eight, and the daughter is twenty years old.  Raima's husband works as manager of Traffic Operation Company, and Raima is involved in animal husbandry and selling milk.  Previously, she was a homemaker and stayed home, however, one day they were given a cow as a gift for their son's wedding.  Since then, Raima started to take care of livestock.  Ten years have passed since then, and thanks to joint efforts of Raima and her husband, they were able to repair their home, buy a refrigerator and marry off their daughter.  Currently, Raima earns close to three thousand som monthly from sales of milk.  She wants to increase her income.  She hopes to obtain a loan for this purpose and buy sheep for fattening.  Raima is confident in her decision to expand her business and dreams of building a house for her son in the future.\r\n\r\nRaima's group partners are:\r\n\r\nBusarahan H. is fifty-two years old.  She grows cotton.  Her daughter helps her in this difficult business.  One of her sons works in Russia, another is a salesperson at a store, and the youngest son goes to school.  Busarahan's husband works as a construction worker.  She requested this loan because she needs to buy mineral fertilizers.\r\n\r\nGulsorahon M. is forty-four years old.  Her husband had to go to Russia for work.  Gulsorahon stayed home with three children.  She is involved in growing cotton and other agricultural crops.  She hopes to obtain this loan in order to buy mineral fertilizers.\r\n\r\nVenera H. is only eighteen years old.  She is not yet married.  Venera is involved in business, specifically reselling sheep.  Besides this, she has permanent job at a cafeteria.  Venera decided to request this loan because she plans to buy sheep for breeding.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Anna Sorokina-Hailey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1300,"image":{"id":569581,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase of sheep for fattening","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Aravan","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":135,"posted_date":"2010-07-20T00:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Raima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Busarahan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gulsorahon","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Venera","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":60000,"loan_amount":1300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4824},{"due_date":"2010-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":5054},{"due_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":5294},{"due_date":"2010-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":5617},{"due_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":5751},{"due_date":"2010-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":6087},{"due_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":6334},{"due_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":6745},{"due_date":"2011-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":7000},{"due_date":"2011-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":7294}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.52},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.71},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":121.7},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":124.6},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.89},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.24},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.14},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":151.66},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.04}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":104.52,"local_amount":4824,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:35:29Z","rounded_local_amount":4903.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159670774,"comment":null},{"amount":93.93,"local_amount":4335,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:38:35Z","rounded_local_amount":4406.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166884427,"comment":null},{"amount":130.28,"local_amount":6013,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:24:01Z","rounded_local_amount":6111.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172151555,"comment":null},{"amount":121.7,"local_amount":5617,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:10:59Z","rounded_local_amount":5709.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177446578,"comment":null},{"amount":124.6,"local_amount":5751,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:57:19Z","rounded_local_amount":5845.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182585745,"comment":null},{"amount":131.71,"local_amount":6079,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:01:05Z","rounded_local_amount":6178.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188721590,"comment":null},{"amount":139.1,"local_amount":6420,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:36:38Z","rounded_local_amount":6525.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191460159,"comment":null},{"amount":144.78,"local_amount":6682,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:07:42Z","rounded_local_amount":6791.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195882413,"comment":null},{"amount":152.66,"local_amount":7046,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:35:46Z","rounded_local_amount":7161.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201323734,"comment":null},{"amount":156.72,"local_amount":7233,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:29:48Z","rounded_local_amount":7351.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206192242,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-07-20T22:04:14Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T11:29:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":215334,"name":"Safia's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Safia is the resident of a small city called Riwind located near Lahore, Pakistan.

Sometimes this task seems to us as something unattainable, a task, requiring unbelievable efforts.  However, if we observe people surrounding us in our daily lives, we notice right away that it is not such a difficult task.  All that a person needs in order to start earning is, before all else, a will to work.  The heroes of our story want to work hard and work for the benefit of their families.  Altyngul M. is the leader of this group.  Altyngul and her family lives in the city of Karabalta.  She is twenty-nine years old and has two children, who are eight and six years old.  In order to support the family, Altyngul's husband works at a market and so does she.  She is involved in retail sales of children's toys.  Altyngul confidently leads her busy retail business.  She always feels that her husband is next to her, and he helps her however he can in his free time.  Altyngul has a stable monthly income of close to ten thousand seven hundred som.  And seven years ago, when they first started their business, it looked like a fairly fragile enterprise.  Then, they obtained a loan and invested close to fifteen thousand som and bought the merchandise.  Over the last few years, thanks to this business, they were able to buy a house and furnish it with new furniture.  Altyngul requested this loan because she wants to buys merchandise with the goal of expanding the selection.  In the future, her plans also include buying a car, repairing a house and buying a cow.\r\n\r\nAltyngul's partners are:\r\n\r\nRoza T. is 35 years old.

For men, the traditional way of making a living has always been either farming or cattle breeding. However, over the last decades, women have diversified their occupations and started doing various other jobs. As for the production of national articles, it requires lots of patience, love and enthusiasm since, if a woman does not put all her talent and passion into the work, she might not make a good article and her product may be left unsold. The heroines of our story make national articles and are involved in cattle breeding and farming. \r\n\r\nNabat S. is 50. She has raised six children. Her daughters are married and live separately. Her only son works in Russia and visits his parents once a year. Nabat\u2019s youngest daughter goes to college. To make a living, Nabat\u2019s husband works as a security guard and Nabat manufactures national articles. She learned this craft from her sister. She would never have dreamed that this acquired skill would become the main source of her income, were it not for the high unemployment rate in the country. Nabat hopes to obtain this loan to purchase fabric for making articles. \r\n\r\n<u>Nabat\u2019s partners:<\/u>\r\nParizat C., 45, is a widow. She is the mother of four children. Three of them are working in Russia. Parizat is engaged in cattle breeding. She has sheep and plans to build a new shed. For now, she needs a loan to purchase some sheep. \r\n\r\nGulzat K., 37, has two children. Both of them go to school. Gulzat\u2019s husband is a village shepherd. Gulzat is also occupied with cattle breeding and selling milk. She manages to make $170 a month. Gulzat has applied for this loan as she wants to buy a piece of land nearby for building a house.\r\n\r\nKandalat S., 43, is married and has four children. Kandalat\u2019s husband has gone to work in Russia and, for now, Kandalat is the sole provider for her family. She breeds cattle and thus manages to earn $105 a month. She needs this loan to purchase sheep to increase the total population of her livestock.\r\n\r\n======================================\r\n\r\n<b>Where Did This Loan Come From?<\/b>\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept \u2013 <b>P<\/b>eople (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), <b>P<\/b>rofit (to be profitable to grow further) and the <b>P<\/b>lanet (taking care of the environment).

He is 29 years old, married and has two children; his son is 6 and his daughter is 3 years old. Bakyt and his family live in his mother\u2019s house. \r\n\r\nHe started to work when he was 20. In the beginning, he worked at a private car wash, and later he was hired by a car-repair shop as a mechanical assist\u0430nt.  When he had earned the necessary start-up capital, he bought his first car \u2013 a used Ford Sierra. From this moment, he changed his job and became a private taxi driver.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Bakyt had a car accident, which was the fault of another driver. Bakyt got injured, and his car became unsuitable for his taxi business, so Bakyt sold it. Bakyt and his family met difficult times as he was the only breadwinner for his family and kids. \r\n\r\nAfter full recovery, he decided to go back into business and took a loan from the Bai Tushum Company to purchase a car. He bought a Volkswagen Golf produced in 1986. The loan was used for its initial purpose and repaid on time and without any delay. This car is the only means of income in the B. family, but its technical condition does not allow it to carry out safe passenger transportation. The car needs to be repaired.\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s why Bakyt applied for another loan, to repair his car so that he can continue to work as a taxi driver. Part of the new loan Bakyt wants to use to renovate the house where his family lives.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Bakyt wants to buy a good minivan with seven seats and continue to work as a taxi driver. Bakyt\u2019s family now lives in a small, old house. Bakyt dreams of buying a good, large house for his family, where they could have their own household.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":569638,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","use":"To

is the most common means of cooking foods for the poor people living in very remote areas of the province, just like the family of Gaudencia G.. Being poor, they cannot afford to buy gas and a gas stove so they settle on using charcoal instead. Aside from its affordable price, it is also the most conveniently accessed commodity for everyone from their distant village. \r\n\r\nGaudencia thought of buying a large volume of charcoal for a wholesaling (by sack instead of per pack) business.  In 2005, she joined ASHI and was able to receive a loan which enabled her to establish such a plan. Years have passed and Gaudencia continued to request loans of increasing amounts. With those loans, she has been able to sustain her business, and the proceeds of the business are used to support the needs of her family and in making a little improvement to their lives.\r\n\r\nShe now is 68 years old, yet she and her husband, who is of the same age, are still working hard to earn money and support the poor lives of their children and grandchildren. Gaudencia\u2019s husband works in a rice farm as a hired laborer, but most of the time he partners with his wife in her charcoal business. \r\n\r\nGaudencia and husband really want to grow their business and make it profitable for their children and grandchildren, so that they can experience a life out from under poverty. Because of this, the woman would like to request a much larger loan through ASHI. With hopes of changing the lives of her children and her grandchildren in the future, she is determined to maintain her excellent performance in ASHI to be able to request for more loans in the future.   \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":569650,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Goods

T. is a 42-year-old married woman who lives in Purok Risal, Barangay Manalad, Cauayan, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures: hog fattening, and a general store.\r\n\r\nEmily\u2019s husband Armando is a driver, and they have three children who are between 12 and 18 years old.  The two younger children are currently going to school and also help their parents in the business as part of their daily chores.\r\n\r\nEmily joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2006 in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve their family's quality of life. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD, she has been able to increase their family income by engaging in her two businesses. Now she earns an average monthly income of $183 from her business activities.\r\n\r\nShe is a member of good standing. Her previous loan of 10,000 PHP was used to fund the operations of her general store, and it had a positive impact on both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is borrowing for the 5th time, this loan in the amount of 12,000 PHP, which she intends to use on her hog fattening business. Emily is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which is to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned their respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":566281,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Additional

Catherine has been engaged in her business for over 11 years and earns approximately 6,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) a month from it. \r\n\r\nThough most of the farmers in their village are men, she does not mind it at all; in fact, she treats that as a motivation to work harder.

Catherine has successfully repaid a previous loan of 17,000 PHP from ASKI. Catherine is requesting a new loan of 22,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase general farm supplies and equipment.

N. is a married woman who lives in Brgy. Sacsac, Dalaguete, Cebu. She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  pig fattening and farming businesses. Her husband, Zacarias N., 57 years old, works as a carpenter to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business. They have four children who are 20 to 31 years old. \r\n\r\nVictoria joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she hoped for something better for her family. Victoria has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow and with the help of her past 11 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 7,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6,000; thus, improving the family's standard of living.\r\n\r\nThis time, for her 12th loan cycle, she is borrowing 15,000 PHP, which she intends to use for her livestock and to purchase fertilizer for farming so that she can continue to save up for future additional capital for her business. Victoria N. is a <i>Dungganon<\/i> woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project <i>Dungganon<\/i> (a Hiligaynon word that means <u>honorable<\/u>). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them <i>Dungganon<\/i> - a title of esteem  that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and

She has been widowed since 1993 and has 3 children: two daughters and one son. Her son is married and lives not far from his mother\u2019s house. Her elder daughter lives and works in Bishkek, the capital of Kyrgyzstan. The youngest daughter, Aidai, lives with her mother and helps in farming. Also, she works as a hairdresser in the small town of Kara-Balta.\r\n\r\nUmut was born into a large, low-income family. She spent most of her time helping her mother in the household, watching after the babies and farming. Umut got married early and kept on living in her parents' house. And, yet, she was still obliged to do a lot of housework and help her mother to look after the juniors. After giving birth to her own son, Umut and her husband moved out. Her parents helped by providing them with sheep, and then Umut\u2018s family began to cultivate clover and barley on the plot of land which was granted by the state. As time passed by, the Kochokovas developed their farm with the revenues from selling their products at the local markets. At the beginning of 1990's, they had already 20 sheep and 3 milking cows.\r\n\r\nIn 1993, however, a tragedy broke all the plans and dreams of the K.'s family; Umut\u2019s husband died suddenly and she had to sell most of the cattle to cover funeral expenses. But, Umut, being a courageous woman concerned for her children\u2019s future, didn\u2019t give in. She continued to work hard. When her son got married, Umut had to sell more cattle to buy a small house for his family.\r\n\r\nToday, Umut has only 2 milk cows and 10 sheep left at her farm. She plans to use the loan to broaden her business by purchasing more cattle. With the revenues from this investment, Umut plans to provide good dowries for her daughters when they marry.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":569678,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase cattle.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Petropavlovka","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2010-07-18T18:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Umut","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":40000,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-07T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2011-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":218.75},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":328.13},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":328.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":218.75,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:08:45Z","rounded_local_amount":10267.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182500103,"comment":null},{"amount":328.13,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:21:15Z","rounded_local_amount":15401.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201238892,"comment":null},{"amount":328.12,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:22:28Z","rounded_local_amount":15401.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221622636,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-07-18T21:39:03Z","paid_date":"2011-08-15T08:22:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":215402,"name":"Benkadi  1 Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Les dix  membres du groupe Benkadi 1 sont des femmes mari\u00e9es avec une moyenne d\u2019\u00e2ge de 48 ans et 3 enfants qui  vivent la plupart dans des familles polygames \u00e0 N\u2019djinina, un des villages de la sous pr\u00e9fecture de Fana, r\u00e9gion de Koulikoro, 2\u00e8me r\u00e9gion administrative du Mali.\nElles collaborent avec l\u2019institution de microfinance Soro Yiriwaso dans le but de pouvoir mieux organiser leurs activit\u00e9s en d\u00e9but d\u2019hivernage. \nLes sp\u00e9culations cultiv\u00e9es sont l\u2019arachide, le pois de terre,   le petit mil, le ma\u00efs.

She was born in a low-income family with many children. She graduated from secondary school, but could not continue her studies because she had to help in the house: she pastured the cattle and milked cows. When she was 19, she was given into marriage and moved to her husband\u2019s home, where she still lives with the husband and his elderly parents. At the husband\u2019s place, she continued to work around the house. At that time, the family had one milk cow and a plot of land where they cultivated clover and barley. Later, their livestock grew and they got sheep and a horse.\r\n\r\nIn 1980, Nesipkul gave birth to their only son. During all these years, their efforts were aimed on supporting and expanding their household and Nesipkul never dealt with any other business. Five years ago, the D.\u2019s son married and moved out. In 2009, Nesipkul got a loan from another bank to buy a car.

Ozodjon is 19 years old and is a young and very energetic guy. For more than three years, together with the help of his family, he has been running a small business selling different kinds of detergents like soap, shampoo, toothpaste, shaving cream, washing powder and many other items in his store. In the picture you can see Ozodjon (a guy standing the left) and his friend.  \n\nToday, Ozodjon is requesting a loan of 10,000 Somoni to increase his stock. He is ready to work even harder, make sacrifices and push every once and a while to achieve his goal and become a successful entrepreneur.\n\nOzodjon\u2019s main goal is to build his own house and have a happy family. At IMON, we believe his perseverance and clear vision will become key success factors in his small business.\n\n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The group is made up of 8 members who know each other. This is its 11th loan with the Realidad foundation.\r\n\r\nThe member of the group named Alicia V. C. is 40 years old and completed her third year of  secondary education and has her secondary school certificate.  She has 2 daughters, Viridiana, who is 18 years old and in high school, and Cristina, who is 20 years old and in her second semester of computer programming. Both of them live in their parents' house. Alicia has a business selling Mexican snacks at her locale in downtown Tlayecac next to the water reservoir. Her house is three blocks from the locale and she walks there. She offers her customers sopes, quesadillas, tlacoyos and gorditas. She is going to use the loan to buy a new dining table and some chairs to have a better quality and more attractive business. She started her business 9 years ago when she inherited it from her mother. Previously she sold rice tacos, sandwiches,  sopes and quesadillas in the school. Her favorite part about working in her business is that she can attend to the children at the school. She takes the products to the school and the children really like them. She personally sells to 30 to 50 customers who arrive to enjoy her food. Her business faces the competition from a locale that offers the same products behind her establishment. With her income she has been able to help her daughters in their studies and continue investing, and also to pay for the loan. Her dream is to build a house on a plot of land that she has in Los Potreros so that when she has grandchildren they will have space to play and she will be able to enjoy them. \r\n\r\nIn the town of Tlayecac there is a mountain called Cruz. It is very beautiful and ecological and always green. There is a cross high up on the mountain and the Day of the Cross is May 3rd. People from the town carry the cross to the church. Alicia gives the people tamales and another woman gives them atole. The cross stays at the church for a month and on the first Sunday of June the people go up the mountain to put the cross back in its place.  \r\n\r\nThe members of the group are: Marcela Cataneda V. and with her loan she will buy worsted yarn to knit and sell napkins. Beda V. C. is going to buy feed for her animals. Ambrosia M. Z. is going to buy soap, eggs, milk and sugar to diversify her grocery store. Yolanda M. R. buys all kinds of candies to sell. Alicia V. C. is going to buy a new table and chairs to improve her business. Yadira C. M. is going to buy coloring, etc., for a better service for her clients. Maria Luisa C. R. is going to buy rice, milk, vegetables, tortillas, etc., to prepare food in her economic kitchen. Maleny S. G. is going to buy cornmeal, tortillas, chicken, beef., etc to make the food she sells. \r\n\r\nAlicia wants to tell Kiva and the Realidad foundation that \"we thank you, because with this this support the other members and I have gotten ahead.\" \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ellen Donohue, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2900,"image":{"id":569268,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy a new table and chairs ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"TLAYECAC MORELOS","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2010-07-20T03:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2900,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marcela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ambrosia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yolanda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alicia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yadira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Luisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maleny ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":37000,"loan_amount":2900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":4625},{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":4625},{"due_date":"2010-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":4625},{"due_date":"2010-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":4625},{"due_date":"2010-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":4625},{"due_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4625},{"due_date":"2010-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":4625},{"due_date":"2010-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":4625}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":362.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":362.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":362.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":362.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":362.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":362.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":362.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":362.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":362.5,"local_amount":4625,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:17:20Z","rounded_local_amount":4630.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159639967,"comment":null},{"amount":725,"local_amount":9250,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:21:16Z","rounded_local_amount":9260.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166854250,"comment":null},{"amount":1087.5,"local_amount":13875,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:11:10Z","rounded_local_amount":13890.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172121147,"comment":null},{"amount":362.5,"local_amount":4625,"processed_date":"2010-10-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:25:59Z","rounded_local_amount":4630.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177415204,"comment":null},{"amount":362.5,"local_amount":4625,"processed_date":"2010-10-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:26:27Z","rounded_local_amount":4630.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177415205,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-07-21T02:51:55Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T14:26:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":215437,"name":"2000 Poty Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Este comit\u00e9 se denomina 2 000 Poty, est\u00e1n en el Primer Ciclo con 10  integrantes, es un grupo que se destaca  en el barrio por ser muy unido, solidario y responsable.\nTienen un gran esp\u00edritu emprendedor, y lo demuestran realizando actividades para recaudar fondos y asi estar al d\u00eda con las cuotas. \nSon muy activas y trabajadoras, y solicitan el cr\u00e9dito cada una para destinarlos a sus actividades y para otros gastos de la familia.\nUna de las integrantes es la se\u00f1ora Hilda quien se dedica al negocio de compra de varios productos de uso de hogar.\nElla compra la producci\u00f3n de sus compa\u00f1eras y los ofrece en su negocio de esta manera ayuda tambi\u00e9n a las dem\u00e1s integrantes para que puedan contar con un ingreso para sus familias.\nElla solicito el pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de leche, huevos, quesos, frutas y verduras, carne.\n","en":"This group is called \"2000 Poty.\"  They are in their first loan cycle, and the group has 10 members.

M\u00e1rquez, 39, is a single mother with two children:  Palmira Anah\u00ed (13 years old) and Roberto (5 years old).  She lives in the riverside community of Emiliano Zapata, in the municipality of Tecpatan, Chiapas, M\u00e9xico. \r\n\r\nShe has sold food for the last ten years.  She started her business in a small house.  With her savings and the help of her father, she was able to construct a small palapa hut where she now tends to her clients.  She comments that it's going very well.  Although there are some days when she does not sell much, it's enough to eat and to buy more merchandise.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan in order to expand her business, so she can save money and help her children to get ahead.  She wants her children to be able to be somebody in life, to have a good education and a better future.  She also wants to help her father with some expenses.\r\n\r\nMs. Refugio is a member of the \"Buena Vista\" (\"Good View\") Group.  The reason for their name is because their palapa hut has a good view along the edge of the highway.  She became a member of this group through one of her friends, who is a representative of the group.\r\n\r\nThe members of the Buena Vista Group are as follows:\r\n\u2022 Marlevert  Hern\u00e1ndez Ju\u00e1rez: sells clothing in nearby communities.\r\n\u2022 Sof\u00eda Garc\u00eda Guti\u00e9rrez: buys and sells pewter cooking utensils.\r\n\u2022 Mar\u00eda del Refugio R.

He is seeking a loan to purchase enough stock since there is a ready market from customers and this will help him expand his business into a wholesale operation.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1375,"image":{"id":569653,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"purchase of more stock into the business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kihihi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2010-07-18T20:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dominic","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Justus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benard","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Auraria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Medard","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Moses","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vangi","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sunday","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Herbert","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":3100000,"loan_amount":1375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":258333.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":258333.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":258333.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":258333.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":258333.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":258333.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":258333.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":258333.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":258333.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":258333.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":258333.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":258333.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.58},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.59},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.58},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.58},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.59},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.58},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.58},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":114.59},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":114.58},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":114.58},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":114.59},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":114.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":229.17,"local_amount":516666,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:47:03Z","rounded_local_amount":517916,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159689458,"comment":null},{"amount":352.21,"local_amount":794084,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:48:13Z","rounded_local_amount":796005.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166903603,"comment":null},{"amount":185.74,"local_amount":418751,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T09:16:30Z","rounded_local_amount":419764.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172297076,"comment":null},{"amount":191,"local_amount":430607,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:35:44Z","rounded_local_amount":431648.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177467351,"comment":null},{"amount":302.3,"local_amount":681559,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:23:57Z","rounded_local_amount":683207.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182605471,"comment":null},{"amount":114.58,"local_amount":258333,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:25:10Z","rounded_local_amount":258958,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188744650,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-07-19T05:44:03Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T14:25:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":215456,"name":"Odette","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Odette was born in 1981.

Reimundo initiated his business 5 years ago after being unemployed; an ailment plaguing our country.  He used to be a worker in the fields and those kind of jobs are becoming more uncommon everyday.

She has various businesses such as: renting out washing machines, selling bed covers, small electric appliances, fish, and even fruit.  She started her first business 6 years ago selling beverages out of her mother's house with the intent of generating funds to help around the house.  She initially received a loan of $1,000,000 COP (approx. $530 USD) that she used to purchase a sewing machine and began making bed covers. From this niche market she established she started to offer minor electrical appliances and this way she was able to accumulate more than 30 clients and increase her sales enough to save up for a motorcycle and start a business of renting out washing machines, that is until her motorcycle was stolen.  She has been persistantly continuing on and not letting her difficult circumstances debilitate her.\r\nAna Sofia is always looking for new business opportunities and 8 months ago began selling fruit and fish where she has found a stable source of income.   \r\nThis will be her 6th loan with the Mario Santo Domingo Organization who's been supportive and with them she's been able to make improvements to her home.  She is currently requesting a loan for 1.800.000 COP ($975 USD) in order to purchase 10 bed covers, 4 fans, 6 DVDs, kitchen supplies, fish, and fruit. \r\nAna Sofia states that despite the many challenges in her personal life she has been able to overcome them; for example, being left alone overlooking her children's education after her husband left the household.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Gustavo  Gutierrez, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":569404,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"Purchase 10 bed covers, 4 fans, 6 DVDs, kitchen supplies, fish, and fruits","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Malambo-Atl\u00e1ntico","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2010-07-20T09:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":975,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana Sofia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1800000,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":136742},{"due_date":"2010-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":139021},{"due_date":"2010-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":141338},{"due_date":"2010-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":143694},{"due_date":"2010-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":146089},{"due_date":"2011-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":148523},{"due_date":"2011-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":150999},{"due_date":"2011-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":153515},{"due_date":"2011-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":156074},{"due_date":"2011-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":158675},{"due_date":"2011-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":161320},{"due_date":"2011-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":164010}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.07},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.3},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.56},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.83},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.14},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.45},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.79},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.15},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.54},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.95},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.38},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":74.07,"local_amount":136742,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:17:23Z","rounded_local_amount":138760.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166850370,"comment":null},{"amount":75.3,"local_amount":139021,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:08:12Z","rounded_local_amount":141072.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172117127,"comment":null},{"amount":76.56,"local_amount":141338,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:01:20Z","rounded_local_amount":143423.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177410997,"comment":null},{"amount":77.83,"local_amount":143694,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:08:45Z","rounded_local_amount":145814.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182550650,"comment":null},{"amount":79.14,"local_amount":146089,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:14:19Z","rounded_local_amount":148245.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188688255,"comment":null},{"amount":80.45,"local_amount":148523,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T23:40:09Z","rounded_local_amount":150714.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191427486,"comment":null},{"amount":81.79,"local_amount":150999,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-16T08:40:48Z","rounded_local_amount":153227.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196000899,"comment":null},{"amount":83.15,"local_amount":153515,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:09:14Z","rounded_local_amount":155780.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201288908,"comment":null},{"amount":346.71,"local_amount":640079,"processed_date":"2011-05-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:17:38Z","rounded_local_amount":649525.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211230073,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-07-20T19:06:37Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T11:17:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":215471,"name":"Agossou Daniel","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"V.

He is a responsible and hardworking man. He lives in his own home with his wife and 6 children. His profession is that of a bricklayer, and he is a specialist in making floors, columns, roofs, taking up bricks and coating walls in cement. When he was still young, he worked as an assistant, gaining experience in the profession and presently it is his main source of income, allowing him to support his family.  His efficiency and effort at work has allowed him to gain customers who are very satisfied, and they have recommended Carlos to their friends.  He enjoys his work; he has spent 35 years doing it and his biggest problem is letting jobs go due to a lack of materials.  In the future, he plans on adquiring machinery to install mayolica tiles and in this way increase his profits. This is his tenth loan with MFP, and he is committed to making his payments as he has done thus far. He has no problems with the other members of the group, because they are very responsible people. With this loan that he will receive, he plans on buying materials and in this way be able to work calmly and quickly.  \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ellen Donohue, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":569843,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction","sector":"Construction","use":"To buy tools to facilitate his work as a bricklayer.

She started selling the clothes a year ago and the embroidery 13 years ago. She is soliciting the loan to stock up on clothes and thread for her embroidery. Her customers say good things about her, since she lets them pay for the clothes in instalments and the embroidery she does is very creative and beautiful.  She feels very happy and excited requesting the loan, since she will be able to grow her business and increase her sales.  She wants this loan so that she can become known in other communities; she needs a large amount of stock in order to sell outside of her community. She also hopes to keep her children in school, since they are the ones that motivate her to get ahead.\r\n\r\nThis photo was taken in the house of Maria Luz.

Amelia\u2019s days begin early in the morning, when she and her husband walk for an hour to get to where their crops are.  This is where they begin their daily chores; working the land, raising peas, potatoes and carrots.  Since their crops are of good quality, they are sought after in central market in Tarma.  What they enjoy most about their work is caring for their crops.  They\u2019ve been doing this for eight years and they consider the most difficult part to be transporting their goods to Tarma, because the sacs they carry are very heavy and it wears them out.  In the future they would like to buy some more land so that they can increase their production.

It is located in the state of Mexico in Mexico.  The group is comprised of 13 members.  This is the first time they have asked CrediCom\u00fan for a loan.\r\n\r\nCarolina Cristina Casta\u00f1eda Garc\u00eda is the treasurer of the group.  She is 31 years old, and she attended school until her second year of high school.  She is a merchant.  She has two children, a son and a daughter.  She sells cooking utensils and cosmetics.  She started two years ago.  \r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan to stock more cooking utensils and cosmetics.  Her customers say that she started her sales by selling door to door to get to know them and what they like to buy from her.  She is very reliable about delivering the products.  Because of the confidence they have in her they prefer to buy from her instead of other places.\r\n\r\nShe started the business because her mother-in-law suggested that she sell.  She started with cosmetics, and from there she saw the option of selling cooking utensils.  She saw that her customers were asking her for cooking utensils.\r\n\r\nAt the time of requesting this loan she feels motivated and happy because she knows that she will be able to do well.  She wants this loan to be able to start the construction of a place in her house.  This is for her customers to have a place where they can buy her products.  It is also so that her business will grow.  She hopes that the sales increase will allow her to keep providing an education to her children and will help with the expansion of her house.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are:\r\n\r\nYAZMIN H.L.
