This past year has been tough for her. She had previously owned a business in one of the local markets, but she lost her kiosk due to a reconstruction project. Not willing to give up, she decided to open a grocery business in an older area of the city where there are no new grocery stores. Many large supermarkets are being built in cities throughout Ukraine, but often small grocery stores close to where people live are much more convenient.<p>\r\n\r\nIrina had been a client with Nadiya Ukraine while she had her previous business. She established a good credit record and was able to obtain the necessary funding to start her new store. She has been in business at the new location for about 8 months. Her husband, Sergei, works closely with her and they are looking forward to seeing their enterprise continue to develop.<p>\r\n\r\nIrina has requested a loan for $900 that will allow her to increase the selection of goods she has available to sell. At this stage in her business development, it is important for her to offer a wide variety of items in order to establish a good reputation and attract more customers. This loan will enable her to continue building a solid foundation for her business so that it will be successful for many years to come.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\u0412 \u0406\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0438 \u0454

is a single mother who supports herself and her sixteen-year-old son through her shoe and textiles sales business. She has operated her business since her son was one year old. Her little sales kiosk is located at the large central market in Kharkiv. Svetlana has learned much in her 15 years as an entrepreneur. She knows her products and has a reputation for offering good service and for being kind and considerate toward her customers. Her desire is to maintain an inventory of good quality products at prices that her customers can afford.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nSvetlana has been an excellent client with Nadiya Ukraine. She has received 15 loans in all and has paid each one back with no delinquencies. She is grateful for the financial assistance, which has been instrumental in the growth and stability of her business.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nSvetlana has requested a loan for $1200 to add to her available purchasing capital. Springtime is a very busy shopping time in Ukraine. The already busy markets get even busier as many shoppers get out to buy things for spring and summer.

I also encourage you to write comments on the pages of your loan recipients so we can pass along your good wishes to the borrowers.\r\n\r\nWe sincerely apologize for the oversight and are putting policies in place to make sure that it doesn\u2019t happen again. Thank you for giving poor entrepreneurs in Cambodia a chance at success! \r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nSopheap Khiev, Kiva partnership coordinator, Cambodia\r\nMr. Chan Mach, General Manager, CREDIT MFI, Cambodia\r\n"}],"funded_date":"2007-04-14T14:15:03Z","paid_date":"2008-03-04T02:23:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":8676,"name":"Baghdagul","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Baghdagul is an IDP from the Armenian occupied Fizuli region of Azerbaijan.

Kiva Lender,\r\n\r\nGreat news! Sok Im has repaid the Kiva loan early! Kiva and CREDIT MFI make every effort to be as transparent as possible so you can trust the information we give you. In this case, we didn\u2019t let you know that the loan had been repaid at the time. Occasionally, when a loan is repaid early, the payment schedule posted on Kiva doesn\u2019t always match the records of our micro finance partner in Cambodia, CREDIT MFI. As in life, the system doesn\u2019t always run perfectly, but when there is a discrepancy we will alert you as soon as possible so you have all the information about your investment.\r\n\r\nOn the upside, the issue occurred because the client\u2019s business is so successful! Your loan made that possible. Soon you will see a repayment posted on the client\u2019s profile that is larger than the usual amount. This will end the loan and return the funds to your account. We hope you will choose to loan the repaid funds to another entrepreneur who would a like a chance to grow their business as well. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please post them as a comment on this borrowers site and I will be happy to respond. I also encourage you to write comments on the pages of your loan recipients so we can pass along your good wishes to the borrowers.\r\n\r\nWe sincerely apologize for the oversight and are putting policies in place to make sure that it doesn\u2019t happen again. Thank you for giving poor entrepreneurs in Cambodia a chance at success! \r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nSopheap Khiev, Kiva partnership coordinator, Cambodia\r\nMr. Chan Mach, General Manager, CREDIT MFI, Cambodia\r\n"}],"funded_date":"2007-04-16T01:04:07Z","paid_date":"2008-03-04T02:33:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":8679,"name":"Ramil","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ramil is an IDP from the occupied region of Fizuli.

Ul Phala has repaid the Kiva loan early! Kiva and CREDIT MFI make every effort to be as transparent as possible so you can trust the information we give you.

Occasionally, when a loan is repaid early, the payment schedule posted on Kiva doesn\u2019t always match the records of our micro finance partner in Cambodia, CREDIT MFI. As in life, the system doesn\u2019t always run perfectly, but when there is a discrepancy we will alert you as soon as possible so you have all the information about your investment.\r\n\r\nOn the upside, the issue occurred because the client\u2019s business is so successful! Your loan made that possible. Soon you will see a repayment posted on the client\u2019s profile that is larger than the usual amount. This will end the loan and return the funds to your account. We hope you will choose to loan the repaid funds to another entrepreneur who would a like a chance to grow their business as well. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please post them as a comment on this borrowers site and I will be happy to respond.

Chey Nary has repaid the Kiva loan early! Kiva and CREDIT MFI make every effort to be as transparent as possible so you can trust the information we give you. In this case, we didn\u2019t let you know that the loan had been repaid at the time. Occasionally, when a loan is repaid early, the payment schedule posted on Kiva doesn\u2019t always match the records of our micro finance partner in Cambodia, CREDIT MFI. As in life, the system doesn\u2019t always run perfectly, but when there is a discrepancy we will alert you as soon as possible so you have all the information about your investment.\r\n\r\nOn the upside, the issue occurred because the client\u2019s business is so successful! Your loan made that possible. Soon you will see a repayment posted on the client\u2019s profile that is larger than the usual amount. This will end the loan and return the funds to your account. We hope you will choose to loan the repaid funds to another entrepreneur who would a like a chance to grow their business as well. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please post them as a comment on this borrowers site and I will be happy to respond. I also encourage you to write comments on the pages of your loan recipients so we can pass along your good wishes to the borrowers.\r\n\r\nWe sincerely apologize for the oversight and are putting policies in place to make sure that it doesn\u2019t happen again. Thank you for giving poor entrepreneurs in Cambodia a chance at success! \r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nSopheap, Kiva partnership coordinator, Cambodia\r\nMr. Chan Mach, General Manager, CREDIT MFI, Cambodia\r\n"}],"funded_date":"2007-04-16T17:53:07Z","paid_date":"2008-03-04T01:53:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":8687,"name":"Zehra","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Zehra is a local of the town of Beylagan.

Ukraine, many people prefer wearing sports shoes to any other kind of shoe. Evgeniy is one of those people. After trying out a couple of other business ventures, he found that he liked selling sports shoes the most. He credits his success to finding a good market opportunity and to timely financial assistance from Nadiya Ukraine. His integrity and hard-working attitude have allowed him to establish his business and keep it stable. \r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nAfter 7 years in business, Evgeniy was recently able to add on to his sales location. Today he is requesting $1000 to stock this additional retail space with new brands of shoes, which he will be able to purchase in bulk. Evgeniy and his wife Anjela are the proud parents of two sons, who they are currently helping through college. His desire is to increase his productivity and raise his net income so that he can continue to provide for his family. \r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\u0412 \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0456

is 37 years old, and she is a single mother of two children, ages 14 and 11, both of whom are in school. She has never had the support of a husband, and has had to get by on her own. She works for a cellular phone company, but the income she receives is not sufficient to cover all the expenses of her household. In order to make extra income, in 2005 Anabell decided to start her own business selling used clothing. At first she sold to neighbors and relatives, and now she has a place in the weekend market.\r\n\r\n<p>Anabell's sales have increased lately, but she does not have sufficient capital to cover the demands of her clients.

is married with four children, all of whom are in primary school. He has not undertaken any training. In 2002 he started his business, which was initially buying and selling cattle. This did not make enough profit for him to sustain his family thus he started selling timber which he does currently. With the proposed loan through PEMCI, he hopes to buy a power saw, which he will use to split his own timber instead of hiring a saw. This will give him an edge over the competition and improve his profit margins. He will also be able to hire out the power saw to other millers, which would bring him some additional income.

after Ukraine gained it\u2019s independence in 1991, Vasiliy took advantage of new economic freedoms and opened his first grocery store in the city of Kharkiv. Fifteen years later, his business is thriving. He has expanded by opening a second store, employs ten people and is in the process of remodeling a third store that will hopefully open soon. Eventually he would like to build a new building on his own land. \r\n\r\nVasiliy is an energetic and hard-working business owner but also very kind and caring. He strives to maintain quality service in his stores and take care of his customers. For each of his employees he provides a retirement plan \u2013 a very good benefit for a private employer. Vasiliy and his wife have two sons and are active in their church. Their desire is for others to share the hope they have in Jesus Christ.\r\n\r\nVasiliy has requested a loan for $1000 to add to his working capital. Increasing competition makes it all the more important for him to maintain a broad and fresh product selection. He\u2019d like to use this money to expand the amount of goods he has available in his stores. \r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\u041f\u0456\u0441\u043b\u044f \u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e, \u044f\u043a

His working day starts at 3 a.m. when he and his assistants begin to knead dough, form the bread, and heat the stove. For the first time, he kneads dough from 2 sacks of flour of 50 kg. each. The summer is an important period for his business, as citizens have many weddings and other family events. He needs to have a stock of flours and coal. A year ago, having received his first loan in the amount of $150, he renewed his supplies that he uses for cake baking. <p>The premises where he bakes is in his home, which is located far from the Isfara central market. That's why he plans to rent a place near the central market for working and storing the flour and other raw materials.

young woman, after graduating from school, could not find a job and had to go to the market for trade.  First she helped her mother, who also traded in the district market. But as she had her own family, she decided to go into business independently. She has one child. <p>At first she sold only children's boots. It did not bring much profit, but it covered part of the family expenses. Having received her first loan from \u201cMicroInvest\u201d last year, she saw the possibility of expanding her assortment of goods.

She also has a stall on Isaac Tamayo Street in La Paz, where she sells hats by the dozen every morning. This is one of the city\u2019s streets that gets a lot of traffic and is dominated by the informal sector. Her hat production is by the dozen, since she sells in bulk to her buyers, who then sell the hats individually; through her business, she indirectly generates several jobs. \r\n<p>\r\nThis is the fifth loan Ernestina has obtained through IMPRO. Her history with our institution qualifies her as a Level 1 client, that is to say, Very Good in payment of her obligation. The amount requested will be used to buy fabric, thread, and burlap (jute) bags.

He hopes he can fix the lands so they can be productive for years to come.  <\/p>\r\n<h4>Communal Banking in Baba<\/h4>\r\n<p>This borrower is part of the newest and largest Communal Bank in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector. <\/p>\r\n<p>The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. <\/p>\r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Baba compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/em><\/p>\r\n<h4>Economy of Baba<\/h4>\r\n<p>The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by big large companies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized the small and informal farms. <\/p>\r\n<p>Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the area as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soy beans, as secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. <\/p>\r\n<h4>Rice Farming <\/h4>\r\n<p>Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plough the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. <\/p>\r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n<p>One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution. Because people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. <\/p>\r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4>\r\n<p>The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province \u201cLos Rios\u201d (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain there are no drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of products including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soy beans. <\/p>\r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4>\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many of the loans will also go towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p>\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":30427,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Rice and Corn Farming","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Baba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.783333 -79.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-04-18T23:41:55Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jacinto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-05-03T21:28:36Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":200,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2007-06-08T09:15:52Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:20:01Z","rounded_local_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":21439,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":-104,"local_amount":-104,"processed_date":"2007-06-30T07:02:48Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:20:01Z","rounded_local_amount":-104,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27080,"comment":"This adjustment was made to compensate for an error with the previous payment posted."},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-07-13T22:39:37Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:20:01Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":31816,"comment":"2do pago centro agr\u00edcola de baba"},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-09-07T19:32:55Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:20:01Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":51902,"comment":"3er pago centro agr\u00edcola de baba"},{"amount":912,"local_amount":912,"processed_date":"2008-01-03T22:20:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:20:01Z","rounded_local_amount":912,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":107783,"comment":"PAGO CENTRO AGRICOLA"}],"funded_date":"2007-04-19T21:28:36Z","paid_date":"2008-01-03T22:20:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":8846,"name":"Juan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p> Juan has been working on this farm his entire life.

Most recently, El Anzuelo was able to start a program that improved their members access to watering services..  \r\n<\/p> \r\n<p>The members of La Asociacion El Anzuelo de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. <\/p> \r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Baba compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/em><\/p> \r\n<h4>Economy of Baba<\/h4> \r\n<p>The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large mulitnational  \r\ncompanies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by the small and informal farms. <\/p>\r\n<p>Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soy beans  \r\nas secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Baba<\/h4> \r\n<p>Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4> \r\n<p>One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution. \r\nBecause people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4> \r\n<p>The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province \u201cLos Rios\u201d (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soy beans. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4> \r\n<p>The loans in this sector will mostly be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p>\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":30429,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Rice farming","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Guayaquil","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.166667 -79.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-04-18T22:53:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-05-03T08:58:58Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":675,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2007-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2007-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2007-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2007-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2007-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":54,"local_amount":54,"processed_date":"2007-06-16T16:56:53Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-14T17:01:40Z","rounded_local_amount":54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":23689,"comment":"1er pago asociaci\u00f3n el anzuelo"},{"amount":54,"local_amount":54,"processed_date":"2007-07-17T21:37:33Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-14T17:01:40Z","rounded_local_amount":54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":33123,"comment":"2do pago asoc el anzuelo"},{"amount":517,"local_amount":517,"processed_date":"2007-12-18T18:23:38Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-14T17:01:40Z","rounded_local_amount":517,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":99066,"comment":"6to pago"},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2008-05-14T17:01:40Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-14T17:01:40Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":210204,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2007-04-19T08:58:58Z","paid_date":"2008-05-14T17:01:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":8847,"name":"Lorenza","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p>Lorenza lives on a farm with her husband and her only child who is now 17.

All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector. <\/p>\r\n<p>The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. <\/p>\r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Baba compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/em><\/p>\r\n<h4>Economy of Baba<\/h4>\r\n<p>The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by big large companies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized the small and informal farms. <\/p>\r\n<p>Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the area as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soy beans, as secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. <\/p>\r\n<h4>Rice Farming <\/h4>\r\n<p>Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plough the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. <\/p>\r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n<p>One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution. Because people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. <\/p>\r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4>\r\n<p>The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province \u201cLos Rios\u201d (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain there are no drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of products including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soy beans. <\/p>\r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4>\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many of the loans will also go towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":30438,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Fertilizer and seeds for rice farming","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Guayaquil","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.166667 -79.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-04-19T21:54:54Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Angela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-05-04T04:04:12Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":200,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2007-06-08T09:15:54Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:10:06Z","rounded_local_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":21441,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":-104,"local_amount":-104,"processed_date":"2007-06-30T07:01:15Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:10:06Z","rounded_local_amount":-104,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27075,"comment":"This adjustment was made to compensate for an error with the previous payment posted."},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-07-13T22:36:54Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:10:06Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":31811,"comment":"2do pago centro agr\u00edcola de baba"},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-09-07T19:31:47Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:10:06Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":51900,"comment":"3er pago centro agr\u00edcola de baba"},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-10-26T00:15:37Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:10:06Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":71911,"comment":"4TO PAGO CENTRO AGR\u00cdCOLA BABA"},{"amount":816,"local_amount":816,"processed_date":"2008-01-03T22:10:06Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:10:06Z","rounded_local_amount":816,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":107771,"comment":"PAGO CENTRO AGRICOLA BABA"}],"funded_date":"2007-04-20T04:04:12Z","paid_date":"2008-01-03T22:10:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":8851,"name":"Carmela","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p>Carmela C.

Toeun Sin has repaid the Kiva loan early! Kiva and CREDIT MFI make every effort to be as transparent as possible so you can trust the information we give you. In this case, we didn\u2019t let you know that the loan had been repaid at the time. Occasionally, when a loan is repaid early, the payment schedule posted on Kiva doesn\u2019t always match the records of our micro finance partner in Cambodia, CREDIT MFI. As in life, the system doesn\u2019t always run perfectly, but when there is a discrepancy we will alert you as soon as possible so you have all the information about your investment.\r\n\r\nOn the upside, the issue occurred because the client\u2019s business is so successful! Your loan made that possible. Soon you will see a repayment posted on the client\u2019s profile that is larger than the usual amount. This will end the loan and return the funds to your account. We hope you will choose to loan the repaid funds to another entrepreneur who would a like a chance to grow their business as well. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please post them as a comment on this borrowers site and I will be happy to respond. I also encourage you to write comments on the pages of your loan recipients so we can pass along your good wishes to the borrowers.\r\n\r\nWe sincerely apologize for the oversight and are putting policies in place to make sure that it doesn\u2019t happen again. Thank you for giving poor entrepreneurs in Cambodia a chance at success! \r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nSopheap Khiev, Kiva partnership coordinator, Cambodia\r\nMr. Chan Mach, General Manager, CREDIT MFI, Cambodia\r\n"}],"funded_date":"2007-04-21T12:24:40Z","paid_date":"2008-03-04T03:39:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":8926,"name":"Miriama","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Miriama is a married mother of one child.

Kiva Lender,\r\n\r\nGreat news! Chu Hong has repaid the Kiva loan early! Kiva and CREDIT MFI make every effort to be as transparent as possible so you can trust the information we give you. In this case, we didn\u2019t let you know that the loan had been repaid at the time. Occasionally, when a loan is repaid early, the payment schedule posted on Kiva doesn\u2019t always match the records of our micro finance partner in Cambodia, CREDIT MFI. As in life, the system doesn\u2019t always run perfectly, but when there is a discrepancy we will alert you as soon as possible so you have all the information about your investment.\r\n\r\nOn the upside, the issue occurred because the client\u2019s business is so successful! Your loan made that possible. Soon you will see a repayment posted on the client\u2019s profile that is larger than the usual amount. This will end the loan and return the funds to your account. We hope you will choose to loan the repaid funds to another entrepreneur who would a like a chance to grow their business as well. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please post them as a comment on this borrowers site and I will be happy to respond. I also encourage you to write comments on the pages of your loan recipients so we can pass along your good wishes to the borrowers.\r\n\r\nWe sincerely apologize for the oversight and are putting policies in place to make sure that it doesn\u2019t happen again. Thank you for giving poor entrepreneurs in Cambodia a chance at success! \r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nSopheap Khiev, Kiva partnership coordinator, Cambodia\r\nMr. Chan Mach, General Manager, CREDIT MFI, Cambodia\r\n"}],"funded_date":"2007-04-21T00:38:42Z","paid_date":"2008-03-04T02:35:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":8935,"name":"Mativa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mativa S.\u2019s business is lawn mowing.<p>When she started in the SPBD program, she started to buy secondhand lawn mowers and started to run her lawn mowing business.

Um Phovhas repaid the Kiva loan early! Kiva and CREDIT MFI make every effort to be as transparent as possible so you can trust the information we give you. In this case, we didn\u2019t let you know that the loan had been repaid at the time. Occasionally, when a loan is repaid early, the payment schedule posted on Kiva doesn\u2019t always match the records of our micro finance partner in Cambodia, CREDIT MFI. As in life, the system doesn\u2019t always run perfectly, but when there is a discrepancy we will alert you as soon as possible so you have all the information about your investment.\r\n\r\nOn the upside, the issue occurred because the client\u2019s business is so successful! Your loan made that possible. Soon you will see a repayment posted on the client\u2019s profile that is larger than the usual amount. This will end the loan and return the funds to your account. We hope you will choose to loan the repaid funds to another entrepreneur who would a like a chance to grow their business as well. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please post them as a comment on this borrowers site and I will be happy to respond. I also encourage you to write comments on the pages of your loan recipients so we can pass along your good wishes to the borrowers.\r\n\r\nWe sincerely apologize for the oversight and are putting policies in place to make sure that it doesn\u2019t happen again. Thank you for giving poor entrepreneurs in Cambodia a chance at success! \r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nSopheap Khiev, Kiva partnership coordinator, Cambodia\r\nMr. Chan Mach, General Manager, CREDIT MFI, Cambodia\r\n"}],"funded_date":"2007-04-21T18:12:28Z","paid_date":"2008-03-04T03:21:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":8943,"name":"Teina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Teina M. is a mother of five children and lives in the Samoan countryside far from town.

Kim Savorn has repaid the Kiva loan early! Kiva and CREDIT MFI make every effort to be as transparent as possible so you can trust the information we give you. In this case, we didn\u2019t let you know that the loan had been repaid at the time. Occasionally, when a loan is repaid early, the payment schedule posted on Kiva doesn\u2019t always match the records of our micro finance partner in Cambodia, CREDIT MFI. As in life, the system doesn\u2019t always run perfectly, but when there is a discrepancy we will alert you as soon as possible so you have all the information about your investment.\r\n\r\nOn the upside, the issue occurred because the client\u2019s business is so successful! Your loan made that possible. Soon you will see a repayment posted on the client\u2019s profile that is larger than the usual amount. This will end the loan and return the funds to your account. We hope you will choose to loan the repaid funds to another entrepreneur who would a like a chance to grow their business as well. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please post them as a comment on this borrowers site and I will be happy to respond. I also encourage you to write comments on the pages of your loan recipients so we can pass along your good wishes to the borrowers.\r\n\r\nWe sincerely apologize for the oversight and are putting policies in place to make sure that it doesn\u2019t happen again. Thank you for giving poor entrepreneurs in Cambodia a chance at success! \r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nSopheap Khiev, Kiva partnership coordinator, Cambodia\r\nMr. Chan Mach, General Manager, CREDIT MFI, Cambodia\r\n"}],"funded_date":"2007-04-20T23:03:15Z","paid_date":"2008-03-04T02:57:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":8946,"name":"Pich","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Pich T. and his wife (pictured here) own a small rice and Khmer food restaurant in Phnom Penh.

Id Phally has repaid the Kiva loan early! Kiva and CREDIT MFI make every effort to be as transparent as possible so you can trust the information we give you. In this case, we didn\u2019t let you know that the loan had been repaid at the time. Occasionally, when a loan is repaid early, the payment schedule posted on Kiva doesn\u2019t always match the records of our micro finance partner in Cambodia, CREDIT MFI. As in life, the system doesn\u2019t always run perfectly, but when there is a discrepancy we will alert you as soon as possible so you have all the information about your investment.\r\n\r\nOn the upside, the issue occurred because the client\u2019s business is so successful! Your loan made that possible. Soon you will see a repayment posted on the client\u2019s profile that is larger than the usual amount. This will end the loan and return the funds to your account. We hope you will choose to loan the repaid funds to another entrepreneur who would a like a chance to grow their business as well. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please post them as a comment on this borrowers site and I will be happy to respond. I also encourage you to write comments on the pages of your loan recipients so we can pass along your good wishes to the borrowers.\r\n\r\nWe sincerely apologize for the oversight and are putting policies in place to make sure that it doesn\u2019t happen again. Thank you for giving poor entrepreneurs in Cambodia a chance at success! \r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nSopheap Khiev, Kiva partnership coordinator, Cambodia\r\nMr. Chan Mach, General Manager, CREDIT MFI, Cambodia\r\n"}],"funded_date":"2007-04-21T09:49:57Z","paid_date":"2008-03-04T02:56:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":8953,"name":"Oun","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Oun S. is 51 years old and works at a small private company earning $2\/day.

Ku Theit has repaid the Kiva loan early! Kiva and CREDIT MFI make every effort to be as transparent as possible so you can trust the information we give you. In this case, we didn\u2019t let you know that the loan had been repaid at the time. Occasionally, when a loan is repaid early, the payment schedule posted on Kiva doesn\u2019t always match the records of our micro finance partner in Cambodia, CREDIT MFI. As in life, the system doesn\u2019t always run perfectly, but when there is a discrepancy we will alert you as soon as possible so you have all the information about your investment.\r\n\r\nOn the upside, the issue occurred because the client\u2019s business is so successful! Your loan made that possible. Soon you will see a repayment posted on the client\u2019s profile that is larger than the usual amount. This will end the loan and return the funds to your account. We hope you will choose to loan the repaid funds to another entrepreneur who would a like a chance to grow their business as well. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please post them as a comment on this borrowers site and I will be happy to respond. I also encourage you to write comments on the pages of your loan recipients so we can pass along your good wishes to the borrowers.\r\n\r\nWe sincerely apologize for the oversight and are putting policies in place to make sure that it doesn\u2019t happen again. Thank you for giving poor entrepreneurs in Cambodia a chance at success! \r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nSopheap Khiev, Kiva partnership coordinator, Cambodia\r\nMr. Chan Mach, General Manager, CREDIT MFI, Cambodia\r\n"}],"funded_date":"2007-04-20T08:59:35Z","paid_date":"2008-03-04T02:44:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":8982,"name":"Fuamatala","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fuamatala P. has a food vending business and sells cooked Samoan dishes, like taro, banana, fish and yam all mixed with coconut cream.

Prak Muong has repaid the Kiva loan early! Kiva and CREDIT MFI make every effort to be as transparent as possible so you can trust the information we give you. In this case, we didn\u2019t let you know that the loan had been repaid at the time. Occasionally, when a loan is repaid early, the payment schedule posted on Kiva doesn\u2019t always match the records of our micro finance partner in Cambodia, CREDIT MFI. As in life, the system doesn\u2019t always run perfectly, but when there is a discrepancy we will alert you as soon as possible so you have all the information about your investment.\r\n\r\nOn the upside, the issue occurred because the client\u2019s business is so successful! Your loan made that possible. Soon you will see a repayment posted on the client\u2019s profile that is larger than the usual amount. This will end the loan and return the funds to your account. We hope you will choose to loan the repaid funds to another entrepreneur who would a like a chance to grow their business as well. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please post them as a comment on this borrowers site and I will be happy to respond. I also encourage you to write comments on the pages of your loan recipients so we can pass along your good wishes to the borrowers.\r\n\r\nWe sincerely apologize for the oversight and are putting policies in place to make sure that it doesn\u2019t happen again. Thank you for giving poor entrepreneurs in Cambodia a chance at success! \r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nSopheap Khiev, Kiva partnership coordinator, Cambodia\r\nMr. Chan Mach, General Manager, CREDIT MFI, Cambodia\r\n"}],"funded_date":"2007-04-23T02:28:06Z","paid_date":"2008-03-04T03:18:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":9007,"name":"Suy Bun","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Suy Bun T. is 29 years old and works as a tailor earning $2.50 per day.

Sem Phan has repaid the Kiva loan early! Kiva and CREDIT MFI make every effort to be as transparent as possible so you can trust the information we give you. In this case, we didn\u2019t let you know that the loan had been repaid at the time. Occasionally, when a loan is repaid early, the payment schedule posted on Kiva doesn\u2019t always match the records of our micro finance partner in Cambodia, CREDIT MFI. As in life, the system doesn\u2019t always run perfectly, but when there is a discrepancy we will alert you as soon as possible so you have all the information about your investment.\r\n\r\nOn the upside, the issue occurred because the client\u2019s business is so successful! Your loan made that possible. Soon you will see a repayment posted on the client\u2019s profile that is larger than the usual amount. This will end the loan and return the funds to your account. We hope you will choose to loan the repaid funds to another entrepreneur who would a like a chance to grow their business as well. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please post them as a comment on this borrowers site and I will be happy to respond. I also encourage you to write comments on the pages of your loan recipients so we can pass along your good wishes to the borrowers.\r\n\r\nWe sincerely apologize for the oversight and are putting policies in place to make sure that it doesn\u2019t happen again. Thank you for giving poor entrepreneurs in Cambodia a chance at success! \r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nSopheap Khiev, Kiva partnership coordinator, Cambodia\r\nMr. Chan Mach, General Manager, CREDIT MFI, Cambodia\r\n"}],"funded_date":"2007-04-23T14:26:47Z","paid_date":"2008-03-04T02:51:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":9013,"name":"Pea","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Pea has many years' experience in sewing, which is a talent that she has had for many years.

He owns a 12 hectare plot in the district of Boane.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, he heard about HLUVUKU-ADSEMA through friends. Alfredo learned more about the conditions for access to loans, and decided to request a loan in order to expand his farming area.\r\n\r\nWith the 25.000,00 MT loan, he intends to expand his maize farming area from 3 hectares to 6 hectares, to purchase seeds and fertilizers, and to clear and prepare plots, consequently increasing his production.\r\n\r\nAlfredo currently employs 3 full-time workers. With the increase of his farming area he plans on hiring 3 more permanent workers, in addition to hiring temporary workers which will be needed when the work load so requires. \r\n\r\nAlfredo\u2019s activities have a great impact in his community because he generates work for 6 community members, and income for their families.

When she received her first loan of ST$750, she bought her own materials and either sold the finished clothing at the flea markets or she provided for all her customers by her own money and they repaid her later. Asosaasaa is hoping to get another loan to help with the extension of the business by building a stable place to sell her sewing materials with very good service. She can also pay her kids' school fees with the money she gets from the business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":30940,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"To purchase

So Faafouina joined SPBD in order to find a way of lifting their family out of poverty. When she joined the program, the SPBD staff and the women in her center spent a lot of time with her, teaching her how to run a business and how to handle cash and count money. Now she is able to handle her business alone and is a whiz at counting money. She is still aiming to grow her business and keep improving her family, and so she is applying for an additional loan to purchase fertilizers that can improve her crop yield. Two of Faafouina\u2019s children have graduated from school and have jobs in government offices.

This means that it falls on her to start up this plantation.
