She is married and has two daughters, a four-year-old and a newborn baby. She and her husband own a motorcycle taxi, which her husband drives, as well as a carpentry shop, where he works when he is not driving the taxi. They opened the workshop a year and a half ago, prior to which her husband worked for a public agency in Ayacucho. He usually works by himself, but when he receives large orders he hires workers. \r\n\r\nNancy is requesting a loan of 2000 soles to buy wood for the workshop. She and her husband work mainly with tornillo (an inexpensive wood found in South America) and sometimes with oak, depending on the order.

The members already have experience with supportive groups, as most of them were part of the last loan they received.  There were some late payments, but the spirit of the most responsible people of the group helped keep them going and they were not defeated by a bad experience.  Now they are confronting a new challenge and feel capable of continuing to work with the communal bank.  All of the members are mothers dedicated to selling various products such as clothing, cosmetics, food, condiments, soft drinks, vegetables, and seasonable products.  Some have permanent sales stalls and others are street vendors.  This loan will be used to buy ingredients and materials, in particular for the Christmas season, which is when the market is the busiest and sells the most products.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

The group includes relatives Yanneth and her daughter Emilene, but each has her own income, so this does not present any problem to the group.  The members make their living selling different products, including clothing, food, and cosmetics.  One member works in screen-printing and has some tools but is not independent, which is one reason for his seeking financing.  He would like to gain independence and open his own business with the experience he has gained in 5 years of work in his field.  As in all business, there is always competition, but with their experience and desire to grow the business, the members know that they can advance.  The group says that the loan they receive from the Agrocapital Foundation will be used to improve their business and grow capital.  One member notes that the members already have experience working in supportive groups with other financial organizations and know the responsibility that comes with a loan.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jill Heske, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2200,"image":{"id":227945,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"Operating Capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-17 -65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":73,"posted_date":"2008-12-01T04:00:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marlene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Matilde","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yaneth Leonidas","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Viviana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emilene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yonny","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Rosario","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary Luz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Victor Rey","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Karina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ilse","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":15500,"loan_amount":2200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1860.8},{"due_date":"2008-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1882.22},{"due_date":"2008-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1903.87},{"due_date":"2008-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1925.78},{"due_date":"2008-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":1947.94},{"due_date":"2009-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1970.36},{"due_date":"2009-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1993.03},{"due_date":"2009-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2016}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":264.11},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":267.15},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":270.23},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":273.34},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":276.48},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":279.66},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":282.88},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":286.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":801.49,"local_amount":5646.89,"processed_date":"2008-12-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T22:06:07Z","rounded_local_amount":5654.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9934490,"comment":null},{"amount":273.34,"local_amount":1925.78,"processed_date":"2008-12-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T22:14:41Z","rounded_local_amount":1928.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9934491,"comment":null},{"amount":276.48,"local_amount":1947.94,"processed_date":"2008-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T22:21:52Z","rounded_local_amount":1950.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9934492,"comment":null},{"amount":279.66,"local_amount":1970.36,"processed_date":"2009-01-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T12:25:45Z","rounded_local_amount":1973.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10215872,"comment":null},{"amount":282.88,"local_amount":1993.03,"processed_date":"2009-01-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T12:34:27Z","rounded_local_amount":1995.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10215873,"comment":null},{"amount":286.15,"local_amount":2016,"processed_date":"2009-02-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:32:43Z","rounded_local_amount":2018.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20399003,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-12-18T07:34:01Z","paid_date":"2009-03-16T08:32:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":75179,"name":"Rosa Leonidas","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosa is a member of the Violeta Village Bank.

She participates in TYM fund since 2005. Before joining TYM fund she and her family's income came from raising livestock and brewing rice wine. With the loan from TYM, she bought a concrete cutting machine for her husband so he could offer his service to cut concrete to people in the region. Thanks to this loan, today her family has a third source of income of 2.000.000 VND a month from the concrete cutting service ran by her husband. This round of loan, Mrs  Tr\u00fac is requesting 9.000.000 VND to buy stock up on rice for her rice wine brewing business thus to increase her family's income in the long run.\r\n\r\n<br

Before joining the fund, her family depended mainly on the salary of her husband, who is a driver.  After joining TYM Fund, she has borrowed funds to invest in selling fertilizer. Her family business is now growing.  Her income from her business grosses at 5,000,000 VND per month, and, combined with her husband's salary, her family's income is steadily growing.  Mrs. Pham wishes to borrow 9,000,000 VND in order to buy two tons of fertilizer to meet the needs of her customers for the incoming growing season.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":228147,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase more potatoes in bulk.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-11-22T00:40:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Suzana A.

G. is a 60-year-old widow with six children, ages 27 to 39. Her husband was attacked by thugs and unfortunately developed internal bleeding that led to his death. She lives in Kayole Corner, J area, where she operates a fabric dyeing and dress making business business.\n\nMary started her business in 2007 after her daughter paid for her to take a dressmaking course, before which she used to sell building stones. She started her business with money she had put together in savings from her stone business. She expanded her business to include fabric dyeing business.\n\nMary finds that clients often request colored scarfs and fabric that she does not have, and this causes them to take their business to her competitors.

In order to join the working world, the young, educated Daouda has chosen to buy and sell fabric, a business he learned from his brother. With 10 years of experience, he is mastering the trade. Lacking consistent financial means, he decided to seek the aid of microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso with whom he is on his first individual loan. He plans to use this loan to buy 8 bolts of fabric and 20 custom bed sheets in Burkina Faso. The material is cut into small pieces that can be used to make suits (shirts and pants) or ordinary pants. With a reputation for selling quality fabrics, Mr. C.\u2019s clientele hasn\u2019t stopped growing. He sells from his house at retail for cash or credit payable monthly to a clientele that consists of all social groups. He envisions opening a fabric shop in Bougouni.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Sherry W., Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":228233,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cloth & Dressmaking Supplies","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy fabrics","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Bougouni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.416667 -7.483333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:46Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Daouda Adama ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":300000,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":27272.73},{"due_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":27272.73},{"due_date":"2009-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":27272.73},{"due_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":27272.73},{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":27272.73},{"due_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":27272.73},{"due_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":27272.73},{"due_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":27272.73},{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":27272.73},{"due_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":27272.73},{"due_date":"2009-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":27272.7}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":54.55},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":54.55},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":54.55},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":54.55},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":54.55},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.55},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.55},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.55},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.55},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.55},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":109.09,"local_amount":54545.46,"processed_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:35:28Z","rounded_local_amount":56292.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9974112,"comment":null},{"amount":54.55,"local_amount":27272.73,"processed_date":"2009-01-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:29:27Z","rounded_local_amount":28146.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14889488,"comment":null},{"amount":54.55,"local_amount":27272.73,"processed_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:14:27Z","rounded_local_amount":28146.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20440281,"comment":null},{"amount":54.55,"local_amount":27272.73,"processed_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:11:29Z","rounded_local_amount":28146.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135649,"comment":null},{"amount":54.54,"local_amount":27272.73,"processed_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:33:55Z","rounded_local_amount":28146.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033450,"comment":null},{"amount":54.55,"local_amount":27272.73,"processed_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:42:34Z","rounded_local_amount":28146.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44620817,"comment":null},{"amount":54.55,"local_amount":27272.73,"processed_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:24:24Z","rounded_local_amount":28146.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53019810,"comment":null},{"amount":54.57,"local_amount":27272.73,"processed_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:22:18Z","rounded_local_amount":28146.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242580,"comment":null},{"amount":54.55,"local_amount":27272.73,"processed_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:45:16Z","rounded_local_amount":28146.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678087,"comment":null},{"amount":54.5,"local_amount":27272.7,"processed_date":"2009-09-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T03:58:20Z","rounded_local_amount":28146.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87112382,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-12-16T01:07:37Z","paid_date":"2009-10-16T03:58:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":75320,"name":"Allen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Twenty-eight-year-old Allen M. is a determined business lady who owns a clothes shop in Kabwohe Training Center.

Since she didn't get the chance to attend school for social reasons, she started to work and make money early on. She decided to sell \"bazin\" cloth (highly prized cloth in Western Africa). With this loan, she will buy 15 pieces of withe \"bazin\" from merchants in the grand market of Bamako (the capital of the Republic of Mali). She then contracts dyers in Bougouni to tint the fabrics in various prized colors or patterns, as requested by her clientele. She then sells the fabrics door-to-door in various neighborhoods in the city, to a mostly female clientele. Furthermore, she also sells in the neighboring cities, most notably in Kolondieba and Yonfolila. With this loan, she foresees to make a profit of XOF 30'000 (ca 60 US$), to be mainly used to increase her working capital.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Patrick Stadelmann, Kiva

She started out with only a small amount of merchandise, but it has been increasing little by little, so much so that she is now able to sell her products in the city of Lima. Her job consists of obtaining wholesale dairy products, then selling them to her customers, who are mostly vendors who have stands in the market near her home. Much like she runs her business, Sof\u00eda maintains her household with great care and dedication. For her, the most difficult stage was when she did not have any capital, but now her business is gradually increasing, and she has several plans in mind. She is a new member of MFP, but she has previously been involved with loans and she knows about work dynamics. She promises to make her payments punctually. Sof\u00eda is currently requesting a 1,000.00 PEN loan with which she will be able to increase her work capital and establish a food sale business that she has in mind.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Elizabeth Casian, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":228308,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"Establish new food sale business ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-11-26T23:30:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sofia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":165}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.6}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":54.28,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2008-12-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T01:19:43Z","rounded_local_amount":167.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9957673,"comment":null},{"amount":54.28,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-01-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:04:54Z","rounded_local_amount":167.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10227923,"comment":null},{"amount":54.28,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-02-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:04:33Z","rounded_local_amount":167.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20423155,"comment":null},{"amount":54.28,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-03-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:35:05Z","rounded_local_amount":167.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116398,"comment":null},{"amount":54.27,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-04-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:44:53Z","rounded_local_amount":167.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011355,"comment":null},{"amount":53.61,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2009-05-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:55:03Z","rounded_local_amount":165.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44594932,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-12-16T12:15:23Z","paid_date":"2009-06-16T00:55:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":75360,"name":"Marleny","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marleny is a member of the Union II Village Bank.

Two of her children study and the oldest works. Se\u00f1ora Ruth has sold various types of food and fried snacks from her house for six years. Her major difficulty is in the winter since where she sells the food there is no ceiling and the rains cause sales to drop. She began with a loan from Afodenic and this is her seventh loan request. It has already greatly helped her family. Thanks to the opportunity she has with the loan to invest, she has been able to help her children stay in school and survive, since she and her husband have separated and all of the expenses have had to be covered by her.

Some have devoted themselves to public transportation and others work in domestic service. They comment that they have to continue working to support their family and pay their debt, in order to demonstrate that they are capable and polite people in their work and are continuous members of the foundation Agrocapital. The loan that the members request is to buy work instruments and supplies for the production of their products. In this manner they can improve their income and their quality of life. As for the borrowing experience, it is not the first time that they have worked with supportive groups and they know the responsibility that is necessary in order to pay back their loan. \r\n<br

This business yields her enough profits so that she can repay her loan punctually. <p>\r\nWith this 1,500.00 PEN loan, which will be repaid in 4 months, she will purchase 100 chickens and chicken feed (1 sack of growing ration, and finishing ration). <p>\r\nMaria states that Manuela Ramos is a big help for her family, and she gives thanks to God for giving her the opportunity to have her own business. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Elizabeth Casian, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":228386,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase 100 chickens and chicken feed ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Yarinacocha - Ucayali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.308056 -74.601389","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:48Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Rosario","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2009-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2009-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2009-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":125,"local_amount":375,"processed_date":"2008-12-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T00:46:23Z","rounded_local_amount":386.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9951854,"comment":null},{"amount":125,"local_amount":375,"processed_date":"2009-01-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T13:43:10Z","rounded_local_amount":386.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10224900,"comment":null},{"amount":125,"local_amount":375,"processed_date":"2009-02-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T19:46:10Z","rounded_local_amount":386.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20417622,"comment":null},{"amount":125,"local_amount":375,"processed_date":"2009-03-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:12:10Z","rounded_local_amount":386.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27111049,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-12-07T05:25:22Z","paid_date":"2009-04-15T20:12:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":75397,"name":"Bertha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Bertha is a member of the Aleli Village Bank.

pertanian turun drastic karena musim kamarau dan harga pupuk yang mahal. Oleh sebab itu Ni Nengah Weli berusaha untuk mendukung pendapatan suami dengan menjalankan usaha beternak babi. Namun usaha ini dijalankan masih secara tradisional dengan cara mengikat babinya pada sebatang pohon, hal ini dilakukan karena Ni Nengah Weli tidak mempunyai modal untuk membuat kandang. Kemudian Ni Nengah Weli mengajukan pinjaman ke Yayasan Dinari, karena selain mendapatkan pinjaman modal, Dinari juga memberikan pelatihan yang berkaitan dengan pemeliharaan babi agar nantinya mendapatkan hasil yang bagus. Modal pinjaman ini akan dipergunakan untuk membuat kandang babi dan membeli  pakan ternak sampai nanti babi ini siap dijual. Dengan adanya usaha ini diharapkan  dapat meningkatkan perekonomian keluarga dan anak \u2013anak mereka tetap bisa bersekolah. Sesuai dengan program Dinari bahwa pinjaman ini akan dilunasi setelah akhir periode pinjaman selama 6 bulan.","en":"Ni Nengah Weli a homemaker helps her husband in the crop field everyday, but recently income from the sale of crops dropped drastically due to the dry season and the high price of fertilizer.  Due to that Ni Nengah Weli make an effort to supplement her husband\u2019s income by carrying out pig farming.  However, this effort is still done in the traditional way where the pig is leased to a tree, the reason that this is done is because Ni Nengah Weli does not have the funds to build a pigpen.  Thus Ni Nengah Weli submit loan request from Dinari Foundation, because beside receiving loan, Dinari also provides training relating to proper pig farming so that later generate good returns.  This funding loan will be used to fund building the pigpen and purchase livestock supplies until the pigs are ready for sale.  With this effort hopefully will improve the family\u2019s financial condition and their children have a consistent education.

Thus, she is asking for a loan to buy pig food. \r\n<P>\r\nMrs. An Rotana who is a group guarantor is also presented in the picture with the group members. This is a village bank loan consisting of mainly end-of-term (EOT) loans. Three members have EOT loans and are not required to pay any principal on their loans until the very end of the loan term. The rest have monthly payment loans. EOT loans are AMK\u2019s main product because they are the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. They allow loan recipients to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time. AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09% and AMK has a default rate of 0% on Kiva.

and crackers.  She caters conferences, parties, seminars and traditional weddings and specializes in local traditional favorites like matoke, samosas and fish fingers.  She sells her snack foods to retail food stores.  She launched Julie\u2019s Big Bite a little over a year ago, turning a hobby into her profession.  Prior, Juliet was a community worker.  Juliet uses her community ties to market her services. <p>\r\n\r\nJuliet is a single mother raising 2 children aged 10 and 12. Both her children attend the best boarding schools she can afford.  She works hard and depends upon her income to keep both of her kids in school.  She will use the loan proceeds to buy wholesale ingredients like sugar, flour and cooking oil.  Juliet used to have to buy these ingredients from retail stores.  Now her profits will rise and she can buy more ingredients to expand her operations.  For example, she wants to introduce coated ground nuts (like peanut M&M\u2019s).  Loans are also a hedge against rising food costs - the global financial crisis has increased retail prices in Uganda, and buying in bulk will help her reduce her costs.<p>\r\n\r\nHer ambition is to grow into a national packaged goods brand and supply hotels and the largest grocery supermarkets.  With her savings, Juliet is constructing a new home for her family.  She hopes to see both her children become university graduates.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":228603,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","use":"Buying wholesale ingredients like sugar, flour and cooking oil.

Seemingly worthless, she found a way to turn it into an income-producing asset.  She dredges the muddy clay soil and turns it into building bricks that she sells by the pallet to construction firms.  Beatrice is perhaps the only woman in Uganda in this highly male-dominated profession.  She employs village boys to help her with the hard labor of baking and piling the manufactured bricks.<p>\r\n\r\nBeatrice is 48 years old, married with 3 children aged 5-16.  All her children are in school.  She started her brick-making business a few years ago on a smaller scale to provide the income needed to pay school fees.  This is her first loan.  She will use the proceeds to buy firewood for the furnace, pay labor wages and purchase additional shovels and wheelbarrows.  Beatrice can sell bricks for a bulk price of 80 to 100 Ush depending on the quantity.  In a good week, she will sell 3,000 bricks and she feels her manufacturing capacity could be as high as 15,000 bricks per week.  One of her business goals is to expand into this capacity.

K., Fatmata K., Fatmata M., Brima M. and Adama K.. They named their group Masorie Progressive Union. They are local entrepreneurs from the village of Masorie. They sometimes come to Makeni, about fifteen miles from Masori, to sell their goods. This is the second time they\u2019ve received a Kiva loan through SMT. Previously, each one in the group received a loan of 500,000 LE. That loan created meaningful impacts in lives of these people. They were able to use the proceeds to pay for their children\u2019s school fees. They\u2019re also able to feed and clothe themselves and their children with the income generated from the loans. Having repaid their last loan successfully, they are now requesting a loan of 700,000 LE each to buy more goods to add to their businesses.\r\n<P>\r\nHumu (right) is the leader of the group. She is thirty-eight years of age. She was born in the village called Sanda Taindarim about thirty miles from Makeni and fifteen miles from Masori. Today, she is married and living in Masori village. Her and her husband have two children, both of whom are attending schools in Freetown. Her husband serves as Section Chief for the people of Masori. His duties include hearing and settling minor disputes between members of the community.\r\n<P>\r\nHumu sells palm oil, rice and other locally produced items in the Masori village. She has been in this business for over ten years now. With this new loan, she will expand her business. She will be able to buy about ten to fifteen barters of palm oil (five gallons make up a barter). A barter of palm oil costs 30,000 LE. She will then choose to either sell in Masori village or take them to Makeni depending on the where she can get better profit. \r\n<P>\r\nTo date, she has not encountered any great challenges worth noting. Business is doing well and she loves and enjoys it. To Humu and her colleagues in the group, an increase in profit means making their lives better. They will be able to take good care of their children, specifically with their educational and nutritional needs, as well as saving some for emergencies.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":228664,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"To increase her stock of palm oil","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Makeni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.883333 -12.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:43Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Humu S.

That loan created meaningful impacts in the lives of these borrowers. They were able to use the proceeds to pay for their children\u2019s school fees. They\u2019re able to feed and clothe themselves and their children with the income generated from the loans. Today, they are requesting a loan of 700,000 LE each to buy more goods to add to their businesses.\r\n<P>\r\nAlpha (right) is the leader of the group. She is twenty years of age. He was born in Massori. He is married with three children: one is in primary school, one is not yet of school age and the third is still waiting to be sent to school. His wife is a businesswoman. Alpha has been selling palm oil for  three years now. With this new loan, he would like to invest it in rice as he senses that palm oil is becoming a scarce commodity thus making it very expensive to buy. Using his bicycle, he will go to the neighboring village of Magbenkia (two miles from Massori) to buy the rice. A bushel of rice costs him 25,000 LE and he will sell either in his village of Massori for 27,000 LE or in Makeni City, where he can sell for up to 30,000 LE. \r\n<P>\r\nThus far, Alpha faces no serious challenge in his business worth noting. His business is going fine and well. He is very passionate about his business. To Alpha and colleagues in the group, an increase in profit means making their lives better. They will be able to take good care of their children, specifically with their educational and nutritional needs, as well as saving some for emergencies.\r\n \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":228673,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase rice for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Makeni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.883333 -12.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:43Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alpha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sallay","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadiatu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hawa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":3500000,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":437500},{"due_date":"2009-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":437500},{"due_date":"2009-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":437500},{"due_date":"2009-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":437500},{"due_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":437500},{"due_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":437500},{"due_date":"2009-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":437500},{"due_date":"2009-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":437500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":146.88},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":146.88},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":146.88},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":146.88},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.88},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.88},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.88},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":176.25,"local_amount":525000,"processed_date":"2008-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T02:57:34Z","rounded_local_amount":529278.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9968670,"comment":null},{"amount":411.25,"local_amount":1225000,"processed_date":"2009-03-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:45:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1234983.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27128892,"comment":null},{"amount":146.87,"local_amount":437500,"processed_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:13:07Z","rounded_local_amount":441065.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36025681,"comment":null},{"amount":323.13,"local_amount":962500,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T23:53:17Z","rounded_local_amount":970344.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53008485,"comment":null},{"amount":117.5,"local_amount":350000,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:26:24Z","rounded_local_amount":352852.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63230829,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-12-14T23:57:18Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T18:26:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":75520,"name":"Shohsanam","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"H.

Accordingly, selling used shoes and slippers is a niche market for many women like Rita to get involved in. \r\n\r\nRita now seeks a loan to increase her business' inventory by purchasing additional used shoes and slippers.

In this group, members guarantee each other's loans as social collateral (i.e., if one member does not promptly repay her portion of the loan, then the other members are responsible for curing the arrears), and they provide support for one another to repay their respective loans.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":228757,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","use":"To generate an increase in sales while food prices are high by purchasing additional food (e.g., fish and meats)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GH","country":"Ghana","town":"Koforidua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.083333 -0.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":88,"posted_date":"2008-11-23T22:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Janet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GHS","disbursal_amount":600,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":42.86},{"due_date":"2008-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":42.86},{"due_date":"2008-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":42.86},{"due_date":"2009-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":42.86},{"due_date":"2009-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":42.86},{"due_date":"2009-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":42.86},{"due_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":42.86},{"due_date":"2009-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":42.86},{"due_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":42.86},{"due_date":"2009-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":42.86},{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":42.86},{"due_date":"2009-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":42.86},{"due_date":"2009-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":42.86},{"due_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":42.82}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":42.86,"processed_date":"2008-12-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:14:58Z","rounded_local_amount":44.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9972521,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":42.86,"processed_date":"2008-12-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:20:05Z","rounded_local_amount":44.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9972522,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":42.86,"processed_date":"2008-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:25:58Z","rounded_local_amount":44.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9972523,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":42.86,"processed_date":"2009-01-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:21:53Z","rounded_local_amount":44.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10235679,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":42.86,"processed_date":"2009-01-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:24:49Z","rounded_local_amount":44.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10235680,"comment":null},{"amount":300.02,"local_amount":342.88,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:37:13Z","rounded_local_amount":356.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44614834,"comment":null},{"amount":37.48,"local_amount":42.82,"processed_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:05:49Z","rounded_local_amount":44.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53011804,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-11-30T13:02:54Z","paid_date":"2009-07-16T00:05:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":75569,"name":"Mary","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mary T. is a 44-year-old married woman with two children, both of whom are in school.

After the recovery, Leontine decided to change the business because of a broken finger that she got from the accident.  She opened a general boutique in late 2005 and has been operating this business to the present day. She sells soaps, sugar, salt, milk, toilet papers, oil, cans, and other household goods. Her business strategies are based on the high quality of goods, strategic pricing, caring for clients and never running out of inventory. With her next loan she is planning to rent a place to move her business indoors in order to avoid the heavy rains. Her dream is to purchase a boat in order to serve rural people as river transport.

It is a shoe store.  He started worked in workshops when he was twelve. As time went on the workshops began to have great losses and closed. It was then that he decided to start his own business outside of the Santos Barcenas market, since there is more traffic there.  The loan is for resources for work -- he needs to be able to purchase waxed thread, glue, and proper shoe soles, which are bought in Managua because wholesale is more convenient for him.

Maria Del Pilar S. is fifty-eight years old, married, and has five children.  Three of her children are still dependent on her.  Her thirty-seven-year-old daughter does not work.  Thirty-nine-year-old Juan Manuel is handicapped.  Her youngest is four and in his second year of school.  Her husband does not work now.  Some of the things she intends to do are keep up her business, get her daughters and family their own house, and, because she likes selling beans, succeed with that business so that she can do well in her country's unstable economy.  She would still like to go on with this business, as the country's situation is not very stable.  She hopes that she and her family can get ahead because all of her children support her in her business.\r\n\r\nMrs. Maria Del Pilar's business is a local store.  Thirty years ago she obtained this establishment in which she sells products like basic grains, and somehow puts bread on the table.  With her husband and children she decided to establish this business to help them to leave in the future.  This is why she decides to stay with the business.  Plus, two similar business sale items are nacatameles and a mill to grind corn.  She turns to this loan to succeed in getting her local store off the ground \u2013 she still has to make purchases from different distributors, and she needs to look for the most profitable place to get the products she will sell.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by HannahLily P, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":228834,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Working Capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2008-12-01T22:20:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Del Pilar ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":5000,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":833.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2008-12-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T22:23:28Z","rounded_local_amount":907.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9935135,"comment":null},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T12:36:31Z","rounded_local_amount":907.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14858631,"comment":null},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2009-02-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:40:51Z","rounded_local_amount":907.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20399887,"comment":null},{"amount":46.57,"local_amount":846.74,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:38:24Z","rounded_local_amount":922.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27091875,"comment":null},{"amount":45.09,"local_amount":819.92,"processed_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:38:21Z","rounded_local_amount":892.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35985274,"comment":null},{"amount":45.85,"local_amount":833.35,"processed_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:09:23Z","rounded_local_amount":907.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44445887,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-12-15T22:43:42Z","paid_date":"2009-06-15T23:09:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":75590,"name":"Modesto Noel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nSu nombre es Modesto Noel R. tiene la edad de 60 a\u00f1os, su estado civil es casado, este se\u00f1or tiene 6 hijos pero no est\u00e1n a su cargo ya todos trabajan por cuenta propia, su esposa no labora es ama de casa, sus  prop\u00f3sito son de mantener activo su negocio por lo dif\u00edcil que se torna la situaci\u00f3n en este pa\u00eds y con este negocio el podr\u00eda ahorrar para poder mantenerse en un futuro, en sus deseos esta el obtener mejoras para su vivienda y proporcionarle a sus nietos la ayuda necesaria mientras el pueda seguir trabajando.\n\n\n\nLa actividad econ\u00f3mica a la que Don Noel se dedica es a la sastrer\u00eda el tiempo que tiene de tener este negocio es de 38 a\u00f1os, el inicia este negocio desde la edad de 12 a\u00f1os y por su propia cuenta decide ingresar a un taller donde adquiere el conocimiento de este oficio lo cual el lo transforma en un trabajo el negocio esta ubicado en su casa de habitaci\u00f3n en le\u00f3n, el financiamiento es para capital de trabajo por lo que el necesita realizar las compras de 150 yardas de tela de dril que se utiliza para la realizaci\u00f3n de los pantalones, compra de zziper, hilo y agujas para la maquina por lo que agradece a fundaci\u00f3n Le\u00f3n 2000 y otras organizaciones por mantener abierto su cr\u00e9dito.\n","en":"Modesto Noel R. is 60 years old, and is married.

Pen H.'s husband (on the right side of the photo) earns income working as a construction worker and blacksmith. On average, he makes around US$4 per day. He has been engaged in the profession since 2000, having learned it from his father. \r\nIn a typical month, Pen H.'s family spends US$45 on food. To help generate more money to support the family, Pen H. is now applying for a loan of US$400 to be able to purchase a cow that would be used for plowing the farmland as well as for transporting the rice crops during the harvest season. Previously, Pen H. had to hire a hand tractor to plow the land.
