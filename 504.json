She hopes to further improve her fishing business through hard work and with continuous support from ASHI and the Kiva Partner.\n\nDue to a lack of business capital, she was encouraged to seek financial support from Kiva lenders. She will be glad if her loan request is granted.  She will use the loan wisely by purchasing materials for her business; such as a fishing cage (fish trap) and other related materials.

The main source of income for the business comes primarily from providing motorela or habal-habal [motorcycle transportation] services to local community members. Boyet has been engaged in his business for over 5 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Boyet joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Boyet has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase tools needed to provide his service. Boyet is requesting a new loan of 8000 PHP that will be used to purchase tools needed to expand services provided. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Boyet from HSPFI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand his business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Hasan has been providing transportation services for the last 13 years. Usually, he transports cargo from Dushanbe to Pamir. Hasan dreams that all of his children will be well educated, so he works hard. As a result, the business generates a significant income that allows him to support his large family.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

Helen is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory and working capital. This loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by Helen from HSPFI.

Within it, vegetable production is what he likes most, as it is easier to cultivate these plants and the product is profitable in season, which is annually. But the earnings are greater and beneficial for every farmer, especially when buyers purchase the production in great quantities and the expense of transporting the products is avoided as the buyers come to harvest and take it away themselves. Now Sayali wishes to borrow money which he wants to invest in seeds, fertilizer, fuels and lubricants.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

","en":"Robinson has been in business for 15 years.  He started off selling women's, men's and children's clothes whilst also working as a construction worker and selling vegetables in Barranquilla public market.\r\n\r\nWhen he married at 21 and had 3 children, 2 boys and a girl, he took on responsibility for his children with experience and he still assumes responsibility  for his children, who are now aged 15, 27 and 28, and his grandchildren.\r\n\r\nRobinson is a dynamic person who takes part in all the activities Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo offers.  He is a member of the football team which the firm organized and has had 2 loans.  With this latest Kiva loan, he plans to buy toys because the end-of-year period is approaching which is when parents buy toys and let their children know that it is \u201cthe Christ child\u201d who brings the toys on the evening of 24th December.  The little ones think that \u201cthe Christ child\u201d brought them from heaven.  On 25th December you can find happy children playing in the streets of Barranquilla with the toys that Robinson sold to their parents such as scooters, dolls, toy cars and whatever toys are popular that year.\r\n\r\nAs Robinson is always aware of what sells each season, he also sells clothes, footwear, costume jewelry, etc. His business does well because he is aware of sales opportunities.  Robinson's business has the following economic indicators: his accounts receivable turnover is 14 days, his current debt is 1% and his capacity to fulfil payment obligations is 99%, 94% with this new loan.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of his first loan, Robinson felt that his business got moving with new capital.  He was able to save a little and increase his profits slightly.  He hopes that some day he will be able to have a store and he dreams of having a vehicle to transport his goods as this would make his life easier."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":652024,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy toys to

She makes her home here in a simple structure with her long-term partner and 2 children. She says that her most difficult challenge was to educate her children. In the meantime she plans to continue enjoying attending church. \r\n\r\nRamona is excited to be taking her 11th loan with Esperanza after having successfully repaid her previous loan and grown her business. She has had her business for 5 years, starting with Esperanza's first loan. She plans to use this loan to invest in her business (a vegetables stand) by buying vegetables and fruit such as plantains, bananas, cassava, yams, sweet potatoes, tomatoes and others. She will use the profits to put aside savings and take care of her hearth; she wishes to have a peaceful life. \r\n\r\nThis Esperanza associate began with us because she wanted to have a business and her story is representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican clients generally, many of whom recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti. Her group is located in San Pedro de Macoris, a city famous for baseball players and its sugar cane industry,where the main economic activity is Free Trading Zone, a cement factory, and others. This area, like nearly all impoverished areas of the Dominican Republic suffers from unreliable running water (none of which is potable) and uncertain electricity.

They are all devoted to Jesus, thus the group name.  They are a group of merchants who daily struggle to obtain profits from their businesses.  There are 8 members that have been participating in the program since 2007.  Arsenia is the group\u2019s Secretary.\r\n\r\nShe is married and has 6 children, two of whom are still dependent on them.  Arsenia has managed to overcome adversity.  She tells us:  when her husband stopped working for a mining firm due to staff reductions, she and her minor children started making and selling tamales because her tasty way of making them made it advisable.  She started out as a street vendor and now she sells based on prior orders in various villages near her home; she goes as far as Chosica.  Her older children managed to study technical careers and one of her daughters managed to travel abroad and sends monthly stipends to help Arsenia because Arsenia\u2019s youngest child has Down\u2019s syndrome.\r\n\r\nArsenia requested the loan to buy ingredients to make tamales because it\u2019s useful for her to be able to buy the corn in bulk to grind, the oil in cans, eggs, olives and others.\r\n\r\nArsenia dreams with having and wants to have a mill to grind the grains of maize because she currently does it by hand.  She also would like to have a stove to cook the tamales that will make things easier for her since she has to get up at 5am several days a week to prepare the tamales.\r\n\r\nMi Amigo Jes\u00fas is an organization whose members participate actively and are happy to be part of Prosperidad as can be seen in the photo.  They are grateful for the support and are committed to being good associates.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2325,"image":{"id":652062,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy a corn mill.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"SANTA CRUZ DE COCACHACRA","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2010-11-26T20:40:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Arsenia Aydee","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marina Sinforosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosario Del Pilar","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elmer Efrain","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fernando Carlos","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatriz Nancy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eli Humberto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":6500,"loan_amount":2325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1625},{"due_date":"2011-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1625},{"due_date":"2011-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1625},{"due_date":"2011-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1625}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":581.25},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":581.25},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":581.25},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":581.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":581.25,"local_amount":1625,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:52:21Z","rounded_local_amount":1632.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188665389,"comment":null},{"amount":581.25,"local_amount":1625,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:51:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1632.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191408632,"comment":null},{"amount":581.25,"local_amount":1625,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:36:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1632.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195826924,"comment":null},{"amount":581.25,"local_amount":1625,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-18T08:01:11Z","rounded_local_amount":1632.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201269185,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-11-30T17:35:08Z","paid_date":"2011-04-18T08:01:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":252748,"name":"Luisana Virginia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Luisana Virginia M.

A..  The name of the group is due to the fact that the members help each other and they feel that when there is a spirit of mutual support among them they feel much pampered.  This is a group consisting for the most part of women living in poverty.  It merits mentioning that even though they are in this condition they are people who work and every day propose to get ahead in life with their eyes always looking towards hope for a better future.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion we will speak about the life of Maritza M..  She is 30 years old and is the group representative.  She\u2019s married to Margarito, 29, who is a public transportation microbus driver.  She has five children: Daniela, 13, Alondra, 11, Yamilet, 9, Irving, 7 and Kimberly, 1.\r\n\r\nAt night Maritza sells traditional food, also known as \u201cantojitos\u201d such as: sopes, enchiladas, tacos, beverages and candy.  Her husband helps her do the prep work.  She sells at night because that\u2019s when her husband is off work.  She has been doing this for over 5 years since she decided to go into it because her husband\u2019s salary didn\u2019t quite suffice to meet her children\u2019s expenses and now school is more expensive.\r\n\r\nMaritza joined a credit group because she needed a loan that she used to buy the necessary raw materials to make her food items.  With this money she will be able to buy the following ingredients: red tomatoes, green chilies, dry chilies, maize to make masa, onions, garlic, oil, lard, chicken and firewood to cook them with.\r\n\r\nOne of Maritza\u2019s dreams it to have a place where she can continue to sell her dishes to more people, that her sales increase so that she can invest more in her business and provide employment to women who need it.  She also hopes that her children finish a career in school, that none of her five children is left without an education, that they have the opportunity to improve themselves and aspire to better living conditions; that her children accomplish what she was unable to do.\r\n\r\nMost of the group members are women; there is only one man.  They are hard working, enthusiastic and filled with infinite hope.  They believe in their dreams and in the goodness of others.\r\n\r\nMaritza is totally grateful for the noble gesture of help shown by those who support Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad, to those around the world who contribute their little grain of sand through Kiva to improve the lives of those less fortunate.  In name of her fellow members she sends a strong hug.\r\n\r\nFollowing are the names of the other members of \u201cLas Consentidas\u201d and their respective productive activities:\r\n\r\nMaritza M. A.. \u2013 Antojitos Sales.\r\n\r\nZoila A.

Este es su tercer financiamiento con la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo organizaci\u00f3n que la ha apoyado para ubicar su negocio en un punto muy comercial y con mayor seguridad.

Su gran desaf\u00edo es el alto nivel de competencias que la obliga a diversificar constantemente sus productos para ofrecer multiples servicios que sus clientes requieren y necesitan. ","en":"Martha Luisa Becerra S. is 41 years old and lives in Los Almendros, municipality of Soledad, with two children age 12 and 14 years. That is where she runs her business called \u201cTienda y Comunicaci\u00f3n donde Martha\u201d (Shopping and Communication at Martha\u2019s), which she has been operating for ten years in a leased facility. \r\n\r\nShe offers a wide number of services: selling snacks, groceries and drinks, photocopies, internet, telecommunications, fax and even taking samples for laboratory tests. The business started by being distributed over two locations, one of which she lived in. This created high leasing costs, so she finally gave up one of the locations and is moving her business and lodging to the other.\r\n\r\nShe is assisted by her children and also has a part-time employee. She also challenges herself at noon, selling lunches and on week-ends selling hot dogs, hamburgers and fries. Martha wants a more promising future for her children, whom she wants to see becoming good and successful people.\r\n\r\nThe move means local adjustments requiring unbudgeted investments, but will result in greater time availability to meet the diverse business requirements. As a result she is requesting a Credikiva loan which will be invested in a metal shutter, a freezer and in the realignment of her business leases. This is her third financial loan granted by the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation,  which has helped her establish her business in a very commercial and secure location. \r\n\r\nHer dream is to acquire a home of her own to provide the best living conditions for her children and ensure they receive quality education. Her greatest challenge is the high level of competence that requires her to constantly diversify her products and offer the multiple services her customers demand and need.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":568.19,"image":{"id":652102,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

It is formed of 10 female members who know one another and are neighbors. Mrs. Francisca A. B. will use the loan to buy shoes to sell by wholesale through a catalog. \u00c1ngela C. Hern\u00e1ndez  will buy wholesale perfumes to sell by catalog. Mrs. Tranquilina F. P.  will buy wholesale shoes to sell. Mrs. Mar\u00eda de los \u00c1ngeles Arag\u00f3n C. will buy corn and sweet potato to cook and sell. Mrs.  Isabel B. C. will buy vegetables, meats, disposable plates and spoons for her soup sales. Mrs. Eustolia A. R. will buy wholesale makeup to sell. Mrs. Gloria Yecenia N. B. will buy rice, eggs, meat, yogurt, fruits, etc. Mrs. Amada M.

For her store, Mrs. Alberta Eugenia V. S.  will buy jackets, pants, blouses, skirts, and sweaters. Mrs.  Eustolia A. R. is a member of the group, 43 years old, stayed in school until 6th grade in elementary, and has 5 children. Tomas who is 26, Rafael who is 24, Salvador who is 20, all work. Oscar who is 16 does not study and works and Fabian is 8 years old and in elementary. Mrs. Eustolia sells Fuller products by catalog,  birthday gifts and is requesting the loan to buy perfumes, creams, lip sticks, eye shadows, wall clocks, toys for small children, motorcycles, toy cars. She started her business 4 years ago when a person passed by and invited her. She gave that person a frying pan when they invited her to become a part of the group to begin using the loans for business. She considers her work important and special because it has helped her economically and she is able to order Fuller sales then resell them. Her favorite part of working with Fuller is the income she receives for herself and her children. It gives her such satisfaction when she wins gifts and sells them that it motivates her to continue selling. That was the first gift she received. Her clients are family and neighbors. She serves 20 to 30 clients and her business is popular because she has spent much time selling. The profits she makes are used to buy more products and promotions. Her husband helps her deliver her orders and charge her clients. In Jantetelco the climate is temperate. Crystalized chilacayote candies are made, milk candy, figs, sweet potatoe, squash,  and  fruit cakes,  shortbread, and other local breads. They also sell squash, sorghum, maiz, beans, and peanuts. Mrs. Eustolia wishes to improve her home since it is missing  plastered walls.  Her plans or hopes are that her business grows, sell vegetables, plastic, and have a car to use with her business.

She has had her business for five years, starting when she first decided to sell clothes and bought a bag of used clothing. She plans to use this loan to invest in her business by buying more clothes. She will use the profits to invest in her business and to respond to her household's needs.\r\n\r\nThis Esperanza associate set out with us because she wanted to start a business and her story is representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican (many of whom recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti) clients generally. Her group is located in in the rural areas surrounding La Romana, where the sugarcane harvest and the tourist industry dominate the economy. This area, like nearly all impoverished areas of the Dominican Republic, suffers from unreliable running water (none of which is potable) and electricity.

She lives with her son and her parents in their own home.  More than 10 years ago she decided to open a store to make more income since she is a teacher and works in a school.  Since then, she goes to school to teach in the mornings and in the afternoons she devotes herself entirely to her store.  Sometimes her parents help her by serving customers when she isn't there.  Both her jobs have allowed her to support her son and help her parents with the household finances.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Flor would like to improve and expand her store since it is one of the busiest as her customers have seen the variety of products and the low prices which she offers.\r\n\r\nThis is Flor's second loan from MFP.

In the meantime she plans to continue to enjoy resting after a working day.\r\n\r\nSusana is excited to be taking her third loan with Esperanza after having successfully repaid her previous loan and grown her business. She has had her business for six years, starting with some capital she and her husband saved. She plans to use this loan to invest in her business by buying stocks of clothes, shoes, and cosmetics etc. She will re-invest the profits in her business because this is high season for sales. She dreams of having her own house.\r\n\r\nThis Esperanza associate began with us because she invested in her business and her story is representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican (many of whom recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti) clients generally.

This group is formed of 10 members who know one another. One of the members is Mrs. Isabel C. S. who is going to use her loan to buy oil, sugar, beans, rice, etc. to supply her grocery store. Mrs. Regina \u00c1ngeles S. is going to buy lingerie to start her business. Mrs. Julia L. N. is going to buy seasonal fruits to sell peanuts, etc.  Mrs. Cristina R.

Mrs. Luz Mar\u00eda Garc\u00eda Mill\u00e1n is going to buy fried tortillas, chicken, milk, cheese, etc. for the production and sale of her products and Mexican meals. Mr. Eduardo L. Guti\u00e9rrez is a member of the group, is 47 years old, single, and is a licensed physical education teacher. He requested the loan for the poulterer's shop he has in the town market. He wants to buy materials and wholesale poultry. Mr. Eduardo offers his clients chicken in pieces, sausage, and seasoned in spices. He started his business 24 years ago since he had a chicken farm. The municipal president granted him the place he has in his poulterer\u2019s shop. This business is very important since his mother depends on it, he is able to make payments, and he can support  his family. His favorite part of his job is meeting people in his clientele such as women, young women, men, and variations. His business is popular for treating his customers well. The obstacles he faces are high costs and the competition he has since other poulterer shops are located nearby. The profits he will receive from his sales will be used to buy more products, a rotisserie, and he plans on achieving that with hard work and treating clients well. Mr. Eduardo\u2019s business has helped him succeed with all of the costs and problem that life brings. In the future he wishes to add more rooms to his home as well as make some general repairs. His dream is to make the most profits possible, have a nice house, and take his mother out more. He is very happy with the loan he is offered because he will but more puoltry for his business. Jonacatepec is a calm village, beautiful, and filled with simple and friendly people. The surroundings are beautiful because it is calm and enclosed by hills. And it is in a temperate zone.

She makes her home here in a simple structure with her long-term partner and a child. She says that her most difficult challenge is to have her own house.  In the meantime she plans to continue enjoying sharing good things with her child.\r\n\r\nKaren is excited to be taking her 7th loan with Esperanza after having successfully repaid her previous loan and grown her business. She has had her business for around 3 years, starting with her first Esperanza loan. She plans to use this loan to invest in her business by buying accessories and silver jewelry. She will use the profits to re-invest in her business and she is dreaming of buying a vehicle to expand her territory and increase her sales.\r\n \r\nThis Esperanza associate began with us because she liked the program and it is for business; her  story is representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican clients generally, many of whom recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti. Her group is located in Hato Mayor, an area famous for agricultural activities and its rural scenery. This area, like nearly all impoverished areas of the Dominican Republic suffers from unreliable running water (none of which is potable) and uncertain electricity.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1925,"image":{"id":652157,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Jewelry","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy accessories and silver jewelry","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"DO","country":"Dominican Republic","town":"Hato Mayor","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"18.833333 -69.333333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":44,"posted_date":"2010-11-26T20:50:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1925,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Karen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yohana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ligia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"DOP","disbursal_amount":70000,"loan_amount":1925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":5294.28},{"due_date":"2010-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":5393.12},{"due_date":"2010-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":5493.78},{"due_date":"2010-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":5596.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":5700.8},{"due_date":"2011-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":5807.21},{"due_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":5915.62},{"due_date":"2011-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":6026.04},{"due_date":"2011-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":6138.52},{"due_date":"2011-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":6253.12},{"due_date":"2011-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":6369.83},{"due_date":"2011-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":6011.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":145.59},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":148.31},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":151.08},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":153.9},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":156.77},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":159.7},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.68},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165.72},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.81},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":171.96},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175.17},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165.31}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":293.9,"local_amount":10687.4,"processed_date":"2010-12-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:58:03Z","rounded_local_amount":10756.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188670936,"comment":null},{"amount":151.08,"local_amount":5493.78,"processed_date":"2010-12-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:58:43Z","rounded_local_amount":5529.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188670937,"comment":null},{"amount":153.9,"local_amount":5596.33,"processed_date":"2010-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:59:46Z","rounded_local_amount":5632.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188670938,"comment":null},{"amount":322.77,"local_amount":11737.19,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:02:54Z","rounded_local_amount":11813.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191414249,"comment":null},{"amount":162.68,"local_amount":5915.67,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:34:29Z","rounded_local_amount":5954.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195991129,"comment":null},{"amount":504.5,"local_amount":18345.52,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:54:52Z","rounded_local_amount":18464.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201275201,"comment":null},{"amount":336.17,"local_amount":12224.11,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:54:37Z","rounded_local_amount":12303.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206142462,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-11-30T15:44:30Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T10:54:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":252787,"name":"Jairo Manuel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nJairo Manuel est\u00e1 solicitando su segundo credikiva, esta entusiasmado porque su negocio Abner A.C.

She shares her life with her husband and her four children.  They live together in their own home.  Clara has been selling vegetables in a small market in her town for more than 12 years.  She makes her sales every morning up until midday.  However, her day's work always begins early in the morning because she has to stock up with fresh vegetables early every day when the wholesalers are distributing to retailers.  Clara's products sell easily because customers always require vegetables to prepare their meals.  For this reason, her business is profitable.  She manages to make enough money to support her family and re-invest in her work.  For this reason, she will continue working on her market stall and hopes to expand her business even further.\r\n\r\nThis is Clara's 18th loan with MFP.

He used to manage his daughter\u2019s shop, which she then left to him for work reasons.\r\n\r\nNowadays Edgardo has a good customer base; he sells on account and offers credit to select customers. This is his second loan with Kiva partner the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation. With the money he plans to buy more supplies, snacks, and drinks before prices go up in December, which is usually what happens. With his previous loan, he bought more stock at better prices so his profits went up slightly. \r\n\r\nEdgardo\u2019s dream is to expand his store and gradually bring in stationery to sell. This will help him diversify into other areas and bring in new customers. His biggest challenge is having enough working capital. His customers pay their bills every six days, and he pays for his merchandise every 27 days. His profit margin is 23%, and he has a credit capacity of 65%.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":651941,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy more supplies, snacks, and drinks before prices go up","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Galapa-Atl\u00e1ntico","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2010-11-26T22:30:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edgardo Jos\u00e9","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":72635},{"due_date":"2011-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":77179},{"due_date":"2011-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":78465},{"due_date":"2011-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":79773},{"due_date":"2011-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":81103},{"due_date":"2011-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":82454},{"due_date":"2011-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":83828},{"due_date":"2011-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":85226},{"due_date":"2011-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":86646},{"due_date":"2011-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":88090},{"due_date":"2011-11-06T07:00:00Z","amount":89558},{"due_date":"2011-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":95043}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.95},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.45},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.15},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.88},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.61},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.34},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.11},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.66},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.45},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.26},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.27}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":39.95,"local_amount":72635,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T23:40:13Z","rounded_local_amount":75524.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191427715,"comment":null},{"amount":42.45,"local_amount":77179,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-16T08:40:59Z","rounded_local_amount":80248.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196001137,"comment":null},{"amount":43.15,"local_amount":78465,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:08:23Z","rounded_local_amount":81585.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201289147,"comment":null},{"amount":43.88,"local_amount":79773,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:05:30Z","rounded_local_amount":82945.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206157289,"comment":null},{"amount":44.61,"local_amount":81103,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:18:20Z","rounded_local_amount":84328.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211230301,"comment":null},{"amount":45.34,"local_amount":82454,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:08:54Z","rounded_local_amount":85733.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216509169,"comment":null},{"amount":46.11,"local_amount":83828,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:49:03Z","rounded_local_amount":87162.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221673393,"comment":null},{"amount":244.51,"local_amount":444563,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:35:47Z","rounded_local_amount":462245.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263325134,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-12-21T05:29:07Z","paid_date":"2012-03-15T09:35:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":252813,"name":"Jose Lupario","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Jose Lupario F.

Ever since she was a girl she has worked in agriculture.  Her parents taught her how to farm.  Even now farming is an important source of income for her family.\r\n\r\nShe currently works managing the income.  She also sells animals, and she sells milk that her cows produce.  She mainly grows corn and potatoes.  When she needs to plant or harvest, she hires workers for these jobs.  Once the production is collected, it is taken to sell in the city of Lima.\r\n\r\nShe also works as an administrator in an educational center that is very close to her house.  She only works half days, and this gives her time to take care of her crops.  Later, she wishes to improve the production of her harvests.\r\n\r\nThis is her 17th loan with MFP.  She is very happy to know that she has financial support.  Also, she is pleased to be part of her communal bank because she knows all of the members, and they are responsible and very supportive.  She is grateful to the people who will be the lenders of the loan that she is requesting.  The loan will be very useful to the progress of her business.

It takes 20 days to make one saddlebag. Her business has been developing and now the number of orders has increased. She wants to obtain some materials like thread, wool and flannel to satisfy the demands of her customers which are increasing during these weeks. For this reason, she thought it was a good idea to request a loan from Edpyme Alternativa for 2000 nuevos soles.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda has already had a loan financed by the Kiva fund and offered though  Edpyme Alternativa\u2019s Capital Semilla product. She is very grateful for the people who collaborated with her through Kiva.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":652410,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","use":"to buy materials to increase her saddlebag and tablecloth business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"El Romero - M\u00f3rrope - Lambayeque","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2010-11-27T01:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Ricardina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-10-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":133.37},{"due_date":"2010-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":148.23},{"due_date":"2011-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":147.11},{"due_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":150.31},{"due_date":"2011-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":161.64},{"due_date":"2011-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":163.78},{"due_date":"2011-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":169.06},{"due_date":"2011-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":173.52},{"due_date":"2011-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":180.12},{"due_date":"2011-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":184.07},{"due_date":"2011-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":192.3},{"due_date":"2011-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":196.49}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.35},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.73},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.48},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.6},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.37},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.28},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.9},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.3},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.72},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.71},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.23}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":48.35,"local_amount":133.37,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:45:59Z","rounded_local_amount":135.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182530849,"comment":null},{"amount":53.73,"local_amount":148.23,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:53:32Z","rounded_local_amount":150.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188666991,"comment":null},{"amount":53.33,"local_amount":147.11,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:55:54Z","rounded_local_amount":149.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191410312,"comment":null},{"amount":54.49,"local_amount":150.31,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:47:57Z","rounded_local_amount":153.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201270889,"comment":null},{"amount":117.96,"local_amount":325.42,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:48:42Z","rounded_local_amount":331.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206137513,"comment":null},{"amount":61.28,"local_amount":169.06,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:00:50Z","rounded_local_amount":172.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211210024,"comment":null},{"amount":62.9,"local_amount":173.52,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:53:36Z","rounded_local_amount":176.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216488348,"comment":null},{"amount":65.3,"local_amount":180.12,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-19T07:43:32Z","rounded_local_amount":183.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":222204639,"comment":null},{"amount":66.72,"local_amount":184.07,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-16T08:04:06Z","rounded_local_amount":187.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227181353,"comment":null},{"amount":140.94,"local_amount":388.79,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:46:46Z","rounded_local_amount":395.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238583103,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-11-27T08:02:27Z","paid_date":"2011-11-15T09:46:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":252875,"name":"Zolila Rosa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"En el cant\u00f3n Rocafuerte se  re\u00fanen cada quince d\u00edas las socias del Banco Comunal Mujeres Trabajadoras.

For Liza V., 43, everything could happen. Liza finished only high school, but she makes sure her educational attainment would not get in the way of her living life to the fullest. She currently lives together with Marcelo, and she is the mother of six children.  They live in Pasay City, Philippines.\r\n\r\nAt present, Liza focuses her entrepreneurial skills on her butcher shop. She knows this is something she can do, given the ten years of experience she has in business and the training she receives from CCT*. She sells pork, chicken meat, and other frozen foods in line with the needs of her customers. Every month, Liza earns Php300 which she uses to meet the needs of her family.\r\n\r\nTo help grow her business, Liza plans to apply for a Php15,000 loan. She plans to use the money she will receive from the loan to buy more meat products to add to her meat shop, because just as everything could happen to her favor, also, any threat could rise up against her business--and that is something she is getting ready for. Nonetheless, Liza, just like any entrepreneur, dreams of expanding her business and meeting the needs of the  larger community.\r\n\r\nSure enough, Liza faces different kinds of challenges both in the aspect of business and family life.

But Rosita is ready to do something extra to make her life more than ordinary. \r\n \r\nRosita's extra effort comes in the form of small-scale businesses. At present, she rents out bed spaces to boarders. She also runs a side-car business, a means of transportation where the family lives, in Pasay City, Philippines.  Aside from that, Rosita is also a vegetable dealer. Putting these together, Rosita is able to earn around Php400 per day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her businesses, Rosita would like to apply for a Php20,000 loan. This would be beneficial as it would enable her to buy extra double-deck beds and increase the number of bed spaces to rent out. The loan would also help her grow her vegetable business as she can then buy more varieties of vegetables to sell. Rosita wants to add more to the number of small-scale businesses she is presently managing. She particularly wants to put up a big business like a grocery store.\r\n\r\nRosita did not note any present challenges except for her health condition.

They live now in Pasay City, Philippines.\r\n\r\nSarah manages a \"carinderia\" (food stall) at her home. Every day she wakes up to cook and serve delicious, healthy meals to people in their neighborhood. She also employs two helpers to assist her in the daily operation of the \"carinderia\". Monthly, she earns at least Php 7,000.\r\n\r\nTo help her grow her business, Sarah would like to apply for a Php 10,000 loan, which she will use to make sure the \"carinderia\" is in good shape to better serve the customers. She plans to buy ingredients of quality and in large quantity to gain a reputation for excellent service. Sarah dreams of expanding the \"carinderia\" and putting up her own store.\r\n\r\nTough, complaining customers challenge Sarah as well as customers who do not pay their debts on time.

E. is from the village of Bonbon, Catarman, Camiguin Province. He is 52 years old. Eden is married and has 4 adult children. To make a living, Eden owns & operates a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from buying and selling fruit especially \"lanzones\" in the local community. Eden has been engaged in his business for over 3 years and earns approximately 3000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Eden joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Eden has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional fruit to sell. Eden is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. This will be the 2nd loan taken out by Eden from HSPFI.

A. is from the village of Maac, Guinsiliban, Camiguin Province. She is 22 years old. Reyna is married and has 3 infant-aged children. To make a living, Reyna owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector operating a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling of bananas & coconuts in the local community. Reyna has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 3000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Reyna joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Reyna has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to buy and sell. Reyna is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. This loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by Reyna from HSPFI.

Steven's affiliation is with Katebo Business group-Mpigi. It has been 10 years now since he set forth in his Fishing and farming businesses in Katebo. Thinking back, Steven says it is his parents who gave him with reassuring pep talk to begin this business. Prior to that, he says he was more engaged in farming. Farming was something he really put effort into and as is the case with most African countries, it was his main means of livelihood. At length, he banked on savings from harvested crop sells to venture into the above mentioned businesses. Steven is happily married and has five kids. Monthly this business brings him 200,000 shillings and with this loan, he says he wants to purchase more equipment for his fishing business. Principally he says he wants to buy fishing nets and a

She is married to Danilo, a carpenter, and they have been blessed with two children who are still studying in high school. \r\n\r\nConcepcion's home serves both as an abode of rest and a venue for business, because at her home she has set up a junk shop to earn a living. She buys and sells a wide range of junk items, like plastics, bottles, newspapers, old and damaged kitchen and home appliances and the like. With this, Concepcion earns a net average of 300 PHP per day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting for a 20,000 PHP loan. She would like to use the loan as capital for buying junk items from scavengers, which she would then sell for a profit. Adding more products to her inventory is a priority for her to improve her business, and the money from the loan would be used to purchase these items. She looks forward to making her business grow and eventually expand.\r\n\r\nConcepcion dreams of having her business grow and attaining financial security, that her children will be able to finish their college education and get a stable job someday. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of how she experienced God in her life for the past week.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance

A. is from the village of Minsapinit, Gingoog City. He is 33 years old. Wilberto is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Wilberto owns and operates a service-based business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from providing motorela or habal-habal (motorbike transportation) services to local community members. Wilberto has been engaged in his business for over two years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Wilberto joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Wilberto has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase tools needed to provide service. Wilberto is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase tools needed to expand services provided. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Wilberto from HSPFI. He plans to use the additional revenue he generates to improve\/expand his business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

is Wilma B., 47, a resident of Caloocan City, Philippines. She is married to Nicomedes B., 51, an overseas Filipino worker. Wilma is the mother of two children who are currently studying in high school and college. By the grace of God, Wilma has managed to support her children's schooling. At this time, she is working hard to be able to send both of them all the way through college. A dream for most Filipino parents, like Wilma, is seeing their children receive a college diploma. Education is the best inheritance parents could leave to their children.\r\n\r\nWilma maintains a direct selling business. She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products through popular direct selling brands like Avon, Fullerlife, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and others. A customer\u2019s order is bought, in cash, by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealer\u2019s prices are lower than those in the catalogue, and these are the profits that dealers are relying on as their income. Wilma\u2019s regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 400 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting an 18,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy orders for her customers. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n \r\nWilma dreams to be able to give all her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She also wants to have her own commercial stall for her direct selling business.

Naseem mai lives in the area within the city named Qaisarabad with her family in a two room brick house. She came here after her marriage 12 years ago. Naseem mai is a widow and has four sons and a daughter. Due to poor financial conditions she could not educate her children. She is a very caring mother and does her household chores very well. \r\n\r\nBesides her household work, Naseem mai operates two businesses simultaneously. She sells shawls and also does sewing work at her home. She buys shawls from the market of Multan and sells to her local area clients, and she sews clothes for her neighbors and relatives. She earns well from both businesses. She puts in so much effort in order to bring happiness for her family so that her children never feel that they have lost their father.   \r\n\r\nShe has applied for a loan from Kiva partner Asasah for her sewing business.

home is undoubtedly important to everyone, including Rhea M.. Rhea is working hard to fulfill her desire for a house to call her own home. With only a high school education, Rhea is ever determined to surpass people's low expectations of her. She has been a CCT* community partner and a widow for years now. She currently lives in Caloocan City, Philippines.\r\n<p>\r\nRhea's home serves both as an abode of rest and a venue for business: she has set up a sari-sari (variety) store in her house to earn a living. She sells a wide range of products to the neighborhood, including items from rice and noodles to detergent powder and soap bars. With this, Rhea earns a net average of Php 300 per day.\r\n<p>\r\nTo help her continue the operation of her business, she is requesting a loan of Php 8,000. Adding more products to her store is a priority for her to improve her business, and the money from the loan would certainly be used to purchase these additional products. She looks forward to making the store grow and eventually expand.\r\n<p>\r\nAt present, Rhea finds it hard to follow up with customers who do not pay their debts on time. But just like any other hardworking entrepreneur, Rhea sees to it that no challenge will ever wear her out.

They have been blessed with eight children, three of whom are already employed and five are still studying in elementary and high school.\r\n\r\nTeresa's home serves both as an abode of rest and a venue for business, because at her home she has set up a sari-sari (variety) store to earn a living. She sells a wide range of products to the neighborhood, which includes items from rice and noodles to detergent powder and soap bars. With this, Teresa earns a net average of Php300 per day. She is working hard in her business and to make sure she helps her husband earn a living. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue of her business, she is requesting a Php10,000 loan. Adding more products to her store is a priority for her to improve her business,  She looks forward to making the store grow and eventually expand.\r\n\r\nAt present, Teresa finds it hard to follow up customers who do not pay their debts on time. But just like any other hardworking entrepreneur, Teresa sees to it that no challenge will  ever wear her out. She dreams of having her variety store improve thus enabling her children to finish their college education and eventually get a stable job.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":652776,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To add more stock to her variety store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Caloocan City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2010-11-27T17:30:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":16.67,"local_amount":666.7,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-16T11:02:39Z","rounded_local_amount":734.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182816902,"comment":null},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":3333.32,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:42:50Z","rounded_local_amount":3670.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188652855,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:28:57Z","rounded_local_amount":2936.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191396010,"comment":null},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:29:23Z","rounded_local_amount":2936.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195814120,"comment":null},{"amount":16.67,"local_amount":666.62,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:38:15Z","rounded_local_amount":734.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201256687,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-11-28T01:22:59Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T10:38:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":253033,"name":"Jealyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jealyn S. is from the village of Pagalungan, Wao, Lanao del Sur.

A. is from the village of Thailand, Banisilan, Cotabato. She is 54 years old. Reynaida is married and has 4 school-age children. To make a living, Reynaida owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector running a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. The main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling vegetables, spices & food seasonings in the local community. Reynaida has been engaged in her business for over 25 years and earns approximately 12000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Reynaida joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Reynaida has successfully repaid a previous loan of 11000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to buy and sell. Reynaida is requesting a new loan of 13000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and for working capital. This loan will be the 10th loan taken out by Reynaida from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand the her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

CCT* Community Partner, Nerissa D. L., 41, finished a degree in midwifery and is married to Emmanuel D. L.. They have three children. They live in Pasay City, south of Manila. Emmanuel works as a train operator. Their three children are all in school: with one in college, another in high school, and the youngest in elementary.\r\n\r\nNerissa finished midwifery but chose to do a business related to transportation. They presently own vehicles which are for hire, mainly by companies. Nerissa also has a small business in rag-making. Altogether, the net earnings of the family per month amount to P11,960.\r\n\r\nNerissa is applying for a loan of P10,000, which she plans to use to buy new tires and other materials needed for the improvement of her vehicles to be  used in business. She would also use the loan to improve the conditions of the vehicles by changing the color and adding some accessories.\r\n\r\nAt present, Nerissa finds the daily collections from the business difficult. Sometimes, the vehicles are penalized for violations, which is expensive. At times, the vehicles get damaged and need repairs. However, Nerissa still hopes and believes that God has destined her for a greater purpose. She dreams of owning a bigger business with more vehicles that would cater to many more companies in Metro Manila and beyond. She also hopes that her rag-making business will increase in sales. Nerissa aims for these breakthroughs in business because she wants to buy her family their own house.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":652784,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","use":"For new tires and other materials needed for the improvement of the vehicles used in her transportation business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Pasay City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2010-11-27T17:50:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nerissa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":2000.01,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-16T11:02:45Z","rounded_local_amount":2202.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182816903,"comment":null},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":3333.35,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:42:52Z","rounded_local_amount":3670.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188652856,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:29:02Z","rounded_local_amount":2936.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191396011,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":1999.96,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:29:02Z","rounded_local_amount":2202.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195814121,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-11-27T23:44:40Z","paid_date":"2011-03-15T11:29:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":253038,"name":"Nafees' Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nafees lives in Multan, which is located in the Punjab province of Pakistan and is known for its history and shrines.
