The idea for the business came from the need to get her family ahead and to support her husband, who was in poor health.

She is very thankful for this opportunity. <p>\r\n With this loan for $275, which she will repay in four months, she will buy fruit, including two sacks of oranges, two bunches of plantains, two hundred avocados, one hundred lemons, two cases of papaya, and more. Additionally, she has a small business selling sodas out of her home. She also counts on field several hectares large where she grows fruit and corn; she has invested some of her money here to help with the harvest.\r\n<p>  Mrs. Juliana is 63 years old, and had eight grown children.

So when TYM opened a branch in her village, she was the first person to join the fund. In her first year, she received a loan of 30 USD which was used to buy pigs. In subsequent loans, she was able to secure bigger loans. The loans were then divided in 2: half was used to buy breeding pigs & egg laying chickens, the other half to buy pigs & chickens for butchery. Beginning 2007, Ms S\u1ef9 concentrates her effort on raising chickens for eggs. Right now she has 700 egg laying chickens. Selling the eggs brings in about 8 USD a day.

The problem of course becomes that the land is continually being divided into smaller and smaller plots. Currently, Uganda has one of the highest birthrates in the world and half of the population is under the age of 15, with no job prospects. <p>\r\nSawya operates a restaurant where she serves typical Ugandan food of beans, meat, matooke, rice.

is a well-dressed 25 year old married mother of three. Every week she travels to Kampala, 5 hours away on the matatoo (taxi) to Masaka (a district in central Uganda), three hours away, to buy clothes for her store. Kampala has a very busy and hectic street marketplace where she can buy discounted new clothes. A lot of women sell used clothes which they buy in wired or gunnysack bales, stuffed with used clothes, but Apophia only buys new clothes. \r\n<p>\r\nThis is a new business for her.

is 45 years old and married with six children. For the past 30 years, she has been farming with her husband. They farm and sell matooke (a plantain banana dish), sugar cane and beans. They are subsistence farmers, who sell the small amount left over after feeding their family. In this area, matooke and unripe bananas are the main staple foods. A matooke plant can yield up to two harvests per year. Growing one matooke plant can easily take up at least 100sq. ft. of land. In addition, the plant's leaves don't let in sunlight, making it hard to grow much around the plant, save for a few sweet potatoes. Coffee also grows well here and yields much more money per sq. ft. <p>\r\n\r\nHowever, people grow much more matooke than coffee. Why? The reason is that a field of matooke can yield mature fruit all year long, so when one plant isn\u2019t producing, another will be. With coffee, you will only get two harvests per year for the entire field. Most people cannot wait for a harvest of coffee.

is a 30-year-old married woman  who looks after her own  four children as well as three orphans. She runs a tailoring business and sells the clothes she tailors. Tailoring  clothes in her village involves using a treadle sewing machine. In fact, in these villages, it is common to see people pedaling away on their treadle machines outside their tailor shops. Clothes made by a tailor are always cheaper than store-bought and is more compelling for buyers because they can take part in the design! <p>\r\n\r\nTailoring is also a skilled trade, so if you have a knack for it and produce good work, you will always be in need, unlike a produce stand that can be here today and gone tomorrow. Here\u2019s another interesting fact: In Uganda, young girls in rural areas often do not complete their formal education.

Her husband supports her both in her business and work about the house, so that she can take care of her housework and the academy at the same time and most of all, take care of the requests for outfits which take a lot of time and patience to make. She is content because of her achievements, and she has a steady clientele. Her goal is to have her own locale so that she can better promote her academy and also to have on hand many typical outfits from all of Peru.<p>\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Molly Puglisi, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nLa se\u00f1ora Ruth Angelica es socia del banco comunal  La Primavera, vive en la Av.

The partners tell us that through the Banco Comunal, they learn how to be punctual, responsible, to save and they say that all the partners are friends and colleagues.<p>\r\n The partners are involved in different businesses such as the sale of food, fruit, shoes, clothes, cereals, and cosmetics, as well as small grocery stores, appliance repair services, and the making of agriculture tools.  Each partner has a different history, such as is the case of Hortensia who worked as an employee in a store and, at the same time, traveled to markets bringing clothes to sell. At first, she brought little merchandise, but presently, she has more merchandise and stock and she sells second-hand clothes. Julia also sells second-hand clothes. At first, she had very little merchandise. Now, her business has grown and she has more customers. She also breeds guinea pigs. Julia has noted that one year ago she had six guinea pigs but now she has 58, which she sells to restaurants.<p>\r\n\r\nThe partners need loans in different amounts. Some amounts are of 200 soles, 400 soles, 600 soles and 800 soles totaling a loan amount of 12,200 soles to the Banco Comunal. These loans will be invested in the purchase of baby clothes, pants, sweaters, cosmetics, tools, carbon stone, spare parts, transistors, integrated circuits, filters, fabric for ponchos for the Carnival celebrations, apples, bananas, papaya, shoes and products for the start of a small caf\u00e9 and rental of premises.\r\n<p>\r\nThey will use their savings to buy necessities for the home and education for their children.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

Uganda<\/b><br><br>\r\nBRAC (Building Resources Across Communities) is a development organization that began operations in Bangladesh as a small-scale relief and rehabilitation project in 1972 to help the country overcome the devastation and trauma of the liberation war and focused on resettling refugees returning from India. Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

BRAC and BRAC Uganda<\/b><br><br>\r\nBRAC (Building Resources Across Communities) is a development organization that began operations in Bangladesh as a small-scale relief and rehabilitation project in 1972 to help the country overcome the devastation and trauma of the liberation war and focused on resettling refugees returning from India. Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education
