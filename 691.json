He has a companion and lives with his four children (all under the age of 18).  Sabino\u2019s a farmer, particularly corn, sorghum and beans.  He learned this occupation from his parents with whom he farmed 24,500 square meters.  All of his farming chores were done by the family without having to hire anyone.  Currently, Sabino farms with help from his wife and children.  He also has cows, bulls and calves to produce milk to sell.\r\n\r\nSabino has asked Fundaci\u00f3n Campo for a loan to buy lumber and metal sheeting to improve his roof. Currently, the wood that holds up the roof is in poor condition and the metal sheets let water seep through when it rains.

She is 36 years old, married, and she has 5 children. She has been producing and selling grills for the past 25 years.

She is a single mother with three children. \r\n\r\nShe is a fighter and has been in the business of making pupusas (tortilla rellenas). She says she began in this field by working for someone else, and it was there she learned to make pupusas. But Maria is a visionary and she wants to have her own business for which she declares that she needs to build a little caf\u00e9 where she could prepare and sell them. \r\n\r\nBefore Maria learned to make pupusas, she worked as a day laborer at a coffee plantation, harvesting coffee, cleaning, and pruning and doing other miscellaneous chores.

She has already seen a great opportunity to earn a good income because nobody else is selling pupusas in her neighborhood.\r\n\r\nIn this way she could give her children a higher standard of living and she would create a culture of saving, since the income that she earns would improve their house from constructing an extra room where her children could continue with their studies. \r\n\r\nMaria says she plans to continue working with Fundaci\u00f3n Campo.

Hace 2 a\u00f1os tomo la decisi\u00f3n de empezar y establecer  su propio negocio de panader\u00eda (elaboraci\u00f3n de pan franc\u00e9s). \u00c9l antes de poner este negocio, fue ayudante de panificador por 8 a\u00f1os y fue as\u00ed como aprendi\u00f3 el negocio y decidi\u00f3 independizarse ya que vio la oportunidad de satisfacer una demanda insatisfecha en su colonia.   \nEl pr\u00e9stamo, ser\u00e1 utilizado para reparar la galera en donde tiene el horno artesanal y su taller, resulta que el piso es de tierra y la l\u00e1mina est\u00e1 da\u00f1ada lo que provoca infiltraci\u00f3n de agua en el invierno y tambi\u00e9n la generaci\u00f3n de part\u00edculas de polvo en verano y charco o lodazal en invierno; es as\u00ed como se hace necesario comprar laminas para techo y materiales como arena, cemento para fraguar el piso de tierra, tambi\u00e9n se comprar\u00e1n bandejas para incrementar la producci\u00f3n de pan.\n El se\u00f1or salvador se traslada tres veces por semana a la cabecera departamental a comprar la materia prima para el trabajo, estos d\u00edas madruga ya que tiene que caminar 1 kil\u00f3metro para llegar hasta la calle principal que es donde pasa el autob\u00fas tard\u00e1ndose 2 horas en el viaje (ida y regreso). Cuando se baja del bus en el desvi\u00f3, ya est\u00e1 su esposa esper\u00e1ndolo para trasladar el producto a su casa ya que no hay calle y lo hacen caminando por veredas y cargando el producto en sus espaldas.\n La elaboraci\u00f3n del pan la realiza por la tarde y tiene el apoyo de su esposa y un ayudante adicional. Para vender el pan lo hace de manera personal sin ning\u00fan medio de transporte, utilizando un canasto caminando a pie por toda la colonia  y logrando as\u00ed la venta del pan. Por ser un pan caliente y artesanal es preferido por sus vecinos y por esa raz\u00f3n tiene un mercado potencial. \nDon salvador nunca ha obtenido cr\u00e9ditos, toda la inversi\u00f3n la realizo cuando trabajo de forma dependiente, pero hoy necesita el cr\u00e9dito para poder fortalecer su unidad productiva y de esa forma ser mas competitivo y lograr crecer con la venta de pan en lugares vecinos sobretodo mejorando la salubridad del taller. El anhelo  es que en un futuro pueda adquirir su propia casa ya que en este momento vive en casa de su suegro y siente  incomodidad por lo que sue\u00f1a con darle mejores condiciones a su esposa, su hijo actual y otros que Dios le regale.\n","en":"Mr. Salvador is 22, has a common-law wife and a 2-year-old son.  Two years ago he decided to set up his own bakery to make French bread.  Before starting the business he worked for eight years as a baker assistant and learned the trade.  He decided to become independent when he saw the opportunity to satisfy a demand not being met in his residential area.\r\n\r\nThe loan will be used to repair the galley where he has an artisan oven and workshop.  The floor is of dirt and the roof is damaged which causes water infiltration in the winter.  In summer it generates dust particles and in winter mud puddles, making it necessary to buy roofing sheet and materials such as sand and cement to put in a concrete floor.  He also wants to buy baking trays to increase bread production. \r\n\r\nSalvador travels three times a week to the department capital to buy raw material for his work.  On such days has to get up very early and walk a kilometer to get to the main street where the bus stops.  The round trip takes two hours.  When he returns his wife is waiting for him at the bus stop so they can carry the goods home on their backs through pathways since there is no street.\r\n \r\nHe bakes bread in the afternoon with the help of his wife.  He sells it door-to-door throughout the area from a basket he carries.  Since the bread is warm and specially made his neighbors prefer his product and there is a potential market.\r\n\r\nSalvador has never received any loans.  He carried out his investment as a result of the work he used to have.  But now he needs a loan to strengthen his production capacity and become more competitive.  By improving his workshop's hygiene he can increase bread sales to nearby locations.  In the future he wants to buy his own house since now he lives with his father-in-law.  He is uncomfortable because he wants to provide the best living conditions for his wife, their son and any more children they may be blessed with.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":213.61,"image":{"id":894451,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","use":"To buy roof sheet, sand, and cement to repair the bakery galley and to buy bread trays.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"La Uni\u00f3n","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2011-10-14T08:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Salvador","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":700,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":50.84},{"due_date":"2011-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":51.56},{"due_date":"2012-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":52.87},{"due_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":54.22},{"due_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":56.41},{"due_date":"2012-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":57.04},{"due_date":"2012-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":59.11},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":59.74},{"due_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":61.73},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":63.09},{"due_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":64.7},{"due_date":"2012-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":68.69}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.84},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.56},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.87},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.22},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.41},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.04},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.11},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.74},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.73},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.09},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.7},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.69}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":52.03,"local_amount":52.03,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:52:37Z","rounded_local_amount":52.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244562723,"comment":null},{"amount":52.8,"local_amount":52.8,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:03:05Z","rounded_local_amount":52.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250773853,"comment":null},{"amount":53.68,"local_amount":53.68,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:16:27Z","rounded_local_amount":53.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257182434,"comment":null},{"amount":55.1,"local_amount":55.1,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:28:48Z","rounded_local_amount":55.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263317404,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-10-21T03:21:08Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":346318,"name":"Sonia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La socia pertenece al banco comunal \u201dIMASUMAC II\u201d; El banco comunal se encuentra ubicado en el distrito de Huanchac en la provincia de Cusco y departamento de Cusco.\nLa socia es la Sra.

Unlike other farmers, he owns his land which was passed down to him by his mother.  It\u2019s four hectares of farmland where he grows potatoes, maca root and barley in large quantities.  He has nine years\u2019 experience in farming and what he likes is harvest season because he sees the fruits of his labors.  He has steady customers who pay good prices for the mature foodstuffs he produces.\r\n\r\nBecause he plants just once a year, he also raises cows that produce fresh milk that he sells to local residents.  He will soon have a calf because one of his cows is pregnant.
