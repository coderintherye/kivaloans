He prepares the product in his house with the help of his wife, and then he sells them in the land terminals in the area. Eventually he also sells them in a toll road close to the city where he lives. \r\n\r\nThis business is the only source of income on which he lives and with which he tries to get ahead. Oscar desires to grow his business with the purchase of more consumables with which he can prepare more King Kongs. For this reason he has seen the necessity of asking Edpyme Alternative for the first time for a loan of 1500 nuevos soles that will help him achieve his goal.\r\n\r\nHe is a hardworking and responsible father. His biggest hope is to give his family a better quality of life and give his children a good education that guarantees them a promising future. In the picture he appears showing us his products before he packages them.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kelley Maynard, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":505686,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase of consumables for making King Kong candy","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Toribia Castro Chirinos - Lambayeque","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2010-03-15T15:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Oscar Amador","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":223.49},{"due_date":"2010-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":241.62},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":247.76},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":254.64},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":261.71},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":270.78}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.95},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.59},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.85},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.36},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.96},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.29}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":81.95,"local_amount":223.49,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:09:10Z","rounded_local_amount":232,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136662307,"comment":null},{"amount":88.59,"local_amount":241.62,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:07:23Z","rounded_local_amount":250.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144695011,"comment":null},{"amount":90.85,"local_amount":247.76,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:38:37Z","rounded_local_amount":257.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151878056,"comment":null},{"amount":93.36,"local_amount":254.64,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:51:02Z","rounded_local_amount":264.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159618084,"comment":null},{"amount":95.96,"local_amount":261.71,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:02:12Z","rounded_local_amount":271.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166832487,"comment":null},{"amount":99.29,"local_amount":270.78,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:56:56Z","rounded_local_amount":281.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172099094,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-03-18T15:43:46Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T09:56:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":184540,"name":"Ram\u00f3n","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"      A la vivienda del se\u00f1or Ram\u00f3n R. le est\u00e1 haciendo falta las barda y un port\u00f3n al frente de la casa, ya que desea la seguridad de su familia. \nPero en este momento no cuenta con el dinero necesario para poder comprar el material y pagarle a la persona que se encargara de la mejora. \nEs por eso que est\u00e1 solicitando un pr\u00e9stamo ya que es muy importante que su familia este segura, porque su vivienda esta cercas del las v\u00edas del ferrocarril. \nDon Ram\u00f3n es empleado de una agencia aduanal en el departamento de jefe de mantenimiento, con una parte de su sueldo planea pagar el cr\u00e9dito.\nLa persona que aparece en la foto es su esposa la se\u00f1ora Vicente Guillermina Salazar, ya que el se\u00f1or Ram\u00f3n se encontraba en su trabajo el d\u00eda de la visita. \n","en":"The home of Ram\u00f3n R. is without a fence or gate in front of the house.

Now she has a refrigerator in the shop, which was purchased to sell ice-cream. The business flourishes day to day, and in the future she wants to buy a car and build a bigger shop. Now her profit per month is 5,000 KGS. With this loan she is going to buy foodstuff to increaseher sales. \r\n\r\nDamira A. is a 27-year-old wife and mother of two little children.

M. had always dreamed of seeing her two children, now 22 and 31, graduate. However, she did not have enough income to support their education so they only reached high school and have been unemployed until now. This is because educational attainment is one of the major requirements for gaining employment. Antonietta thinks that, due to poverty, they have fewer opportunities than the wealthy. If only she and her husband, who is a small-time farm laborer, happened to have a lot of money, her dream for her children could have been reached. \r\n<br>Despite what has happened, Antonietta doesn\u2019t like to keep herself in a shell of regret. She wants to be enlightened and find a way to improve her family's standard of living. For this reason, she joined Kiva partner, ASHI, and felt very happy to be given the opportunity of a loan. The first few loans she received enabled her to support her husband\u2019s rice farming and cattle-fattening businesses. The profits from these businesses has been the main source of family income. Now Antonietta has access to capital, her profits are better than before. Therefore, she is now requesting another ASHI loan through Kiva for a much larger amount. This will enable her to grow their business further so that their children at least have their own income by working in their own business.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":505800,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To

He is 23 years old.  When his parents separated, his mother worked as a seamstress.  When she went to the city of Santa Cruz, he took over her small business.  He learned how to sew at a very young age by watching his mother, and became an expert tailor.  He creates dresses for baptisms, parties, galas, formal and informal events, and sells them in the markets in our city.  He lives in his parents' house and in the future he hopes to own a national chain of dress stores for girls.  The money from this loan will be used to purchase fabric wholesale for the creation of his beautiful dresses.  He is a responsible and hard working person.

She hopes the house will improve her living conditions and provide her young children with a roof over their heads.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":505994,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"Buy construction materials for house construction.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Somotillo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":74,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":825,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dorca Elena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":17000,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1485.73},{"due_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1529.69},{"due_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1574.95},{"due_date":"2010-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1621.55},{"due_date":"2010-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1669.53},{"due_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1718.93},{"due_date":"2010-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1769.79},{"due_date":"2010-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1822.16},{"due_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1876.07},{"due_date":"2011-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1931.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.1},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.24},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.43},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.69},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.02},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.42},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.89},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.43},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.04},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.74}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":184630,"name":"Luz De San Antonio Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"LUZ D.

San Antonio\r\nThe 12 members of this communal bank are very enterprising and responsible.  They have demonstrated this during the nine cycles in which they have worked with Edaprospo.  Their prime objective, among others, is to give their loved ones the best.  They put forth great effort everyday in their businesses in order to reach their goal.  What follows is Nancy\u2019s story.\r\n\r\nNancy is 31, and she has three children.  With a husband who gives her all of his support, she started in the world of business.  Since she was very young she has sold tripe as a traveling vendor and prepared food for some of the \u201cmotocarro\u201d (three wheeled motorized vehicles) drivers.  It was through these drivers that she found out that the motocarro business was profitable.\r\n\r\nShe then decided to get a motocarro with the income from her sales and what she could save from her husband\u2019s salary.  That way they rented one.  When she saw that this business was profitable, she decided to buy another motocarro.  She later came to have two more.\r\n\r\nWhen she saw the need for an immediate loan, she did not know where to go.  It was through a neighbor that she found out about the benefits that Edaprospo offers.  She used her first loan for the maintenance and operation of her motocarros.  Thanks to the loan with Edaprospo, her income was improving.  It was a big help and of great use.  \r\n\r\nBut, as time passed she felt the competition in this business.  She decided to sell her motocarros and invest in a new business, renting rooms in her house.  She currently has one motocarro that she got by selling her previous motocarros after about one year of use.\r\n\r\nShe plans on using her next loan from Edaprospo on the construction of her house in order to make the people who want to rent a room more comfortable.  What she has in mind is having a comfortable house to give her family a better quality of life.  She also wants to give her children a good education so that they will become good professionals.  These are plans for the future, and she is sure she will accomplish them.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2250,"image":{"id":506038,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction","sector":"Construction","use":"Build rooms","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chosica","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.943056 -76.709444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2010-03-15T18:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Enma Gina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nancy Elizabeth ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Olinda Yola","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yolanda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bertha Giovana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esther","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Llerlit","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Everlinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hermenegilda Trinidad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Celina Julia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Diana Eloina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eva Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":6250,"loan_amount":2250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1562.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1562.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1562.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1562.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":562.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":562.68,"local_amount":1563,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:44:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1580.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128933830,"comment":null},{"amount":562.32,"local_amount":1562,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:07:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1579.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136661443,"comment":null},{"amount":562.68,"local_amount":1563,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:06:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1580.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144694103,"comment":null},{"amount":562.32,"local_amount":1562,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:37:38Z","rounded_local_amount":1579.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151877067,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-03-28T00:48:32Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T09:37:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":184631,"name":"Suneetha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Suneetha R. is a 39-year-old woman who is married and living with her husband and one child in the town of Dickwella in the Matara district of southern Sri Lanka.\r\n\r\nSuneetha runs a paper bag business independently, while her husband is in the fishing business.

while her husband has his own fishing business. She has been in the coir making business for three years, which consists of extracting the fibers of a coconut to be woven together into different forms of rope or yarn, which can then be woven together to make products such as floor mats.\r\n\r\nRuchika is a hard-working woman who is very knowledgeable about her business. She is asking for a 30,000 LKR loan in order to purchase more raw materials in order to extract the coir. Eventually, in the future, she hopes to purchase a new coir machine with her profits.\r\n\r\nFor now, Ruchika hopes to expand and develop her business further as there is low competition in the area and she sees room for

She thought that maybe this is because he realized how hard his mother worked just to earn money for their needs. He goes fishing to have his own income for the needs of his own family.\r\n\r\nBeing a mother and a grandparent, Lorna cannot seem to ignore the feeling of guilt when she sees her son and his family suffer from shortage of food and other basic needs.\r\n\r\nWhen Lorna joined ASHI, the loan she requested was used to support her son\u2019s fishing business. She sells the fish caught by her son by going house to house to the people in town, particularly in the neighboring village. The profits of this business are shared with her son and his family. This provides their cash flow and provides them with their basic needs.\r\n\r\nThe income, however, is just too small to support their need to improve their standard of living. Thus, Lorna is now requesting a much larger loan to put up her own businesses which are a variety store and hog\/pig fattening. With an inventory in her store of items most needed by people like rice, charcoal (used to cook food), soap, and beverages, she will gain more customers from around the village.\r\n\r\nThe hogs she fattens can be slaughtered after four months and the meat sold in her store. If not, the pig can also be sold live to a meat vendor in the market.\r\n\r\nLorna is hoping that her envisioned businesses will help her in supporting the financial needs of her two children so that they are able to graduate from college. By then, she thinks their lives would be changed and she will have her dreams fulfilled.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":506297,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"To

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. \r\n\r\nClaridel is married with two school-aged children. To make a living, she owns and operates a general store selling a variety of different products to the local community. She has done this for over 15 years and earns approximately 10000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Claridel joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Claridel has successfully repaid a previous loan from ASKI. Now she is requesting a new loan of 35000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and working capital. This will be the eleventh loan taken out by Claridel from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI: ASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fishermen, and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Her youngest and only girl works as a domestic helper in Manila.\r\n\r\nDespite being poor and frustrated because of her failure to graduate her children from college, Estrella is still determined to provide them with a better kind of life through the loans she can access through ASHI and Kiva. The loan she is requesting will be used to purchase another motorcycle to be managed by one of her sons. Through this loan, his income will be regularized to support his own needs. Estrella also wishes to purchase more fishing gear for her husband so that they can increase their profits and will be able to purchase appliances for their small house. This is because she wants her children to experience a more comfortable kind of living.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":506281,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle

Janeth has been engaged in her business for over 20 years and earns approximately 6000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Janeth joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6,000 PHP from ASKI. Now she is requesting a new loan of 9000 PHP which will be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Janeth from ASKI.

She and her family were very poor and she worked hard to help her fisherman husband earn money for the cash flow of her family and to be able to support the education of her children until they graduated from college.\r\n\r\nWhen she became a member of ASHI seven years ago, loans Margie requested and received were spent on a business. Several businesses her loans have been financing include her husband\u2019s fishing, and tricycle (motorcycle with sidecar) for hire businesses. She was able to purchase a fishing motorboat and also a tricycle which he operates once the fishing is off-season. He also sometimes uses the vehicle as a service for selling fish to the people in their village.\r\n\r\nMargie was able to have her own business to manage as well, as she was able to purchase piglets for fattening. All these businesses still exist. As a matter of fact, her hog-fattening business has already grown and she has been able to sell more pigs to a lot of meat vendors.\r\n\r\nDespite the time required to manage her businesses, since she is also helping her husband in selling the fish, she makes sure that she is also able to spend time with her children. She wants her productive and reproductive roles played fairly.\r\n\r\nMargie\u2019s children are inspired by the effort they see from their mother. They studied very hard to graduate from college to make their mother happy. Expenses for their education came from their mother\u2019s educational loan from ASHI.\r\n\r\nEven though Margie has been facing several failures and problems in life, she is still happy because she was able to achieve her dream of graduating her five children from college. Now, four of them have their own jobs and source of income.\r\n\r\nHowever, Margie still aims to grow her fishing business. Her son, who is unemployed, will be operating another fishing boat she plans to purchase using the loan she is requesting from Kiva this time.\r\n\r\nThe proceeds of her businesses will be used to improve their house as well as making their life different from the one they once had.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":506419,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase a

However, when he got an individual loan, he really improved his business and continues to do so, attracting a good number of customers, making a good income for his family, and repaying the loan on time and without any difficulty. \r\nHe has requested a second loan to enlarge his shop and maintain his business with even more success.

She wakes up in the early hours and finishes her domestic chores, then she goes to attend to her grocery store that she has been managing for the last five years. \r\n\r\nShe has given birth to two children: one son and one daughter, both of whom are students. The circumstances have made her mature at an early age. She understands her responsibilities and started performing them accordingly. Her husband completed his education through 8th standard and then started helping his father in his wheat grinding business. Then he later adapted this work as his own profession. Their incomes help meet the expenses. \r\n\r\nHer grocery store is located in a competitive environment and she needs to increase the products to manage the customer base and to improve sales. For this reason she has requested a loan of Pak Rs. 15,000.\r\n\r\nShe has five other ladies in her loan group. Muniran baji wants a loan to buy groceries for her grocery shop. Imtiaz baji, Haleema baji, Noor bhari baji and ZIkran baji each want a loan to buy fertilizer to sell.\r\n\r\nThis is a group loan. The loan funds will be distributed among the group members, each of whom will invest in her own business. The members mutually guarantee one another's loans. If one member does not repay, the other members are responsible.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":506530,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"To

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Virginia has been a client of our institution since 2007.  She owns a restaurant in the Villa Salome area, a business that she has operated for some time and knows well.  Her husband used to own a pool hall but he sold it and opened another restaurant in Pampahasi, a suburb east of La Paz.  \r\n\r\nBoth businesses are thriving because they are well known in their respective areas.  The couple has a 2 year old daughter and they live in Pampahasi.  Pampahasi, on the eastern side of La Paz, is considered both a residential neighborhood and a tourist destination.  In the last nine years, the town has grown enormously and conditions for its 30,000 inhabitants have improved, as well.  \r\n\r\nFrom the edge of the town, at the Segundo Cruce bridge near the border with Villa San Antonio, you can see impressive buildings of up to four floors with finished facades, along paved streets and wide avenues, lined with green lawns and open areas.\r\n\r\nThe town has 16 neighborhoods in three zones: Bajo Pampahasi (Illimani-San Juan), Centro (Venus Fields) and Alto (Said-Crus Pata, ex SAMAPA, Cerveceria and La Guardia).  It's here that the two live alone because their family is in the country.  The loan that she is applying for will be used to buy the building where the restaurant operates (using a uniquely Bolivian form of property ownership).  The purchase will allow her to avoid paying a monthly rent.  Virginia is a responsible and hard-working person.  She is grateful to Emprender and Kiva for the trust they've place in her by extending this loan.\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<br

She will use the requested loan to buy some products for her business so she can always fulfill her customers' requests.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Andrea Rosenberg, Kiva

Asomarse a ella es adentrarse en la cosmovisi\u00f3n andina, donde se vive la ritualidad de las actividades comerciales del mundo Aymara. Por las calles, es com\u00fan escuchar el \u201crebajame, aumentame\u201d, formas centenarias de entrar en este espacio particular y que de ninguna manera se manejan en un supermercado u otros espacios. La feria 16 de Julio es una recreaci\u00f3n de los \u201cColqa\u201d o tambos de la \u00e9poca colonial, que eran una especie de almacenes de alimentos por donde circulaban gran cantidad de productos.\nSin embargo, el verdadero origen de este mercado se remonta a los a\u00f1os 60, cuando las calles que hoy se ven repletas ten\u00edan escasos puestos, que casi se pod\u00edan contar con los dedos de las manos. El auge comenz\u00f3 m\u00e1s tarde, durante la d\u00e9cada de los 80, cuando una fuerte crisis econ\u00f3mica asol\u00f3 el pa\u00eds y hubo un despido general de mineros y empleados p\u00fablicos. La gente tuvo que buscar sustentos donde se pod\u00eda. Fue entonces cuando muchos vieron en el mercado una buena forma de salir adelante) de la ciudad de el alto. Esta feria tiene lugar los d\u00edas jueves y domingo, pero esta feria es la mas grande de esta ciudad. Su esposo, Juan, trabaja con un minibus como servicio de transporte y esta afiliado al sindicato de transportes Miraflores. Ellos viven en la zona de Pampahasi  (La zona de Pampahasi, ubicada en la ladera Este de la ciudad, es considerada como un barrio residencial y tur\u00edstico. En los \u00faltimos nueve a\u00f1os alcanz\u00f3 un desarrollo vertiginoso que se tradujo en mejores condiciones de vida para los aproximadamente 30.000 habitantes. \n\nDesde la entrada a la zona, el punto denominado segundo cruce, el l\u00edmite con Villa San Antonio, se pueden advertir  imponentes edificaciones de hasta cuatro plantas, muchas de ellas con fachadas acabadas, como tambi\u00e9n calles y amplias avenidas asfaltadas, a lo que se suman las jardineras y los espacios de recreaci\u00f3n.\nLa zona abarca 16 barrios en tres sectores: Bajo Pampahasi (Illimani-San Juan), Centro (cancha Venus) y Alto (Said-Cruz Pata, ex SAMAPA, Cervecer\u00eda y La Guardia). \n\nCuenta con 11 establecimientos educativos, uno de ellos privado, dos de convenio y el resto fiscales. Tiene tres mercados, de los cuales el principal es el 10 de Noviembre, ubicado en Pampahasi Central)\nla cual se encuentra a 20 minutos del centro de la ciudad. Ellos tienen un hijo que esta en edad escolar. Doris compra la ropa por fardos, ya que es ropa a medio uso, cada fardo tiene de 100 a 200 unidades de las cuales ella las separa en tres grupos, las de primera calidad, las de segunda calidad y el resto que es de remate. Doris trabaja con la venta de ropa hace mas de once a\u00f1o y ahora ella anhela ver a su hijo como un profesional. Solicita el pr\u00e9stamo para poder comprar doce fardos de ropa.\n\nLa Sra.

To take a look inside is to get a world view of Andean life where the commercial rituals of the Aymara world is in full view.  It is not unusual to hear along the streets the \u201crebajame,\u201d \u201caumentame,\u201d (a little less, a little more), age-old ways of entering this particular space which would never be seen in a supermarket or other commercial space.  The 16 de Julio market is a recreation of the \u201cColga\u201dor \u201cTambos\u201d of the Colonial era, which were a type of food warehouse wherein a great quantity of products circulated.  \r\n\r\nHowever, the real origin of this market goes back to the 1960s when the streets seen now full of sales stands had few; they could be counted with the fingers.  Its growth spurt happened in the 1980s when a severe economic crisis devastated the country and there were general dismissals of miners and public employees.  People had to find ways to support themselves any way they could.\r\n\r\nThat was when many of them recognized the market as a good way to get ahead in the city of El Alto.  This market takes place on Thursday and Sunday and is the largest in the city.\r\n\r\nHer husband, Juan, drives a minibus and is a member of the Miraflores transportation union.  They live in the Pampahasi neighborhood.  (Pampahasi is located on the eastern side of the city; it\u2019s considered to be a residential and tourist area.  In the last nine years it has had dramatic growth,  which has meant improved living conditions for its approximately 30.000 residents).\r\n\r\nFrom the entrance to the area, a point called Segundo Cruce, abutting with Villa San Antonio, one can see imposing buildings, up to four storeys tall, many with finished facades.  Streets are wide and paved and there are flower planters and recreational areas.\r\n\r\nThe zone encompasses 16 neighborhoods in three sectors: Bajo Pampahasi (Illimani-San Juan), Centro (Cancha Venus) and Alto (Said-Cruz Pata, ex SAMAPA, Cervecer\u00eda and La Guardia).\r\n\r\nIt has 11 educational establishments: one private, two church run and the rest public.  It has three markets, the main one being 10 de Noviembre, located in Pampahasi Central, which is 20 minutes from city center.\r\n\r\nDoris buys clothes in bundles since it is semi-used.  Each bundle has between 100 and 200 items, which she sorts into three groups: first quality, second quality, and bargain.\r\n\r\nDoris has sold clothes for over 11 years and now dreams of seeing her son become a professional; they have a son who is of school age.\r\n\r\nShe is asking for funds to buy 12 bundles of clothes.\r\n\r\nDoris is very grateful to Emprender and to Kiva for the trust placed in her by granting the loan.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva

She raises turkeys, ducks, chickens and pigs that she sells to various merchants that visit the area regularly.

Therefore, she has called upon Edpyme Alternativa for the first time to request a 1500 new sol loan to buy building materials and supplies for this purpose.\r\n\r\nShe is quite a responsible young woman who is dedicated to her family.

This communal association was organized in a new housing area that still does not have electricity or running water.  The members have stated that no other financial institution was willing to extend them credit, or to trust them.  They, on the other hand, are limited because they are unable to have capital or develop their businesses.\r\n\r\nThe members are in a variety of commercial activities, such as: shirt and skirt making, candy sales, pastry making, sale of spices, egg sales, neighborhood grocery store, and photocopy services.\r\n\r\nJanett M., married and the mother of two children, tells us that she has a skirt and shirt-making shop.  She learned these skills by helping her sister-in-law and they currently work together.\r\n\r\nShe works based on prior orders.

It was previously known as \"Crecer Juntas\" (Growing Together).  It is made up of eight members, seven ladies and one gentleman.  Most of the members live in the Pampahasi zone, located on the east side of the city, and known for being a residential and tourist neighborhood. Over the past nine years the area has undergone a vigorous development, which translated into better living conditions for its approximately 30,000 residents.\r\n\r\nFrom the entrance to the zone, the point known as \"Segundo Cruce\" (Second Crossing), the border with Villa San Antonio, one notices important buildings up to four stories tall.  Many of them have been completed.  There are also paved streets and wide avenues, gardens, and recreation areas. \r\n\r\nThe zone includes 16 neighborhoods and three sectors: Bajo Pampahasi (Illimani-San Juan), Centro (cancha Venus) y Alto (Said-Cruz Pata, ex SAMAPA, Cervecer\u00eda y La Guardia).\r\n\r\nThere are 11 schools, one private, two covenant schools, and the rest public schools. There are three markets, the main one is called \"el 10 de Noviembre\" (November 10th), located in central Pampahasi.  They are located three blocks from our Emprender office.  The members sell different products, such as frocks, bedspreads, empanadas, condiments and other things.  In the past all repaid their loans, with the exception of two people who paid with their bank savings.\r\n\r\nAlejandra is in charge and the president of the bank.  She sells frocks in the zone and has been doing this for 20 years.  She worked with Emprender two years ago and will use the money from this loan to invest in frock items.  She is a widow and lives with her adult son.  She has distinguished herself as being a very responsible person within her communal bank, with a reputation for being on time with her payments.\r\n\r\nJuana is the treasurer.  She sells condiments in the Pampahasi zone and has been doing this for the past four years.  She will use the money from this loan to buy condiments in bulk.  She is a widow with two children to support.  Juana is one of the communal banks representatives who was elected because of her demonstrated responsibility and good relationship with the other members.\r\n\r\nModesta is an active and dynamic member who serves as the Secretary.

He also takes charge of his half-sisters.\r\n\r\nHis main activity is retail commerce which he embarked on ten years ago. His secondary activity is vegetable gardening, which is quite developed in Notto, due to its privileged position in the Niayes area of Senegal. The area is rather unique, characterized by dunes and depressions often flooded by an overflowing water table, and a favourable climate. This environment was certainly attractive to the population and gave the whole region its agronomic vocation.\r\n\r\nMr. N. has practiced vegetable gardening for the past 20 years, influenced by his father who had the same activity. In fact, Mr. N. started helping his father in his gardening work from an early age. He eventually took the initiative to develop his own commercial activity, which allowed him to develop relations with the outside world.\r\n\r\nWhen U-IMCEC opened a branch office in 2009 to help producers in the area, Mr. N. became a member and is now requesting a first loan for 50,000 FCFA. He wants to buy bags of vegetables (potatoes,\u2026) he will resell at the market. He expects that his earnings will increase thanks to this loan.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ren\u00e9 McConnell, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":506699,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"Buy supplies of vegetables for retail","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"THIES","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.783333 -16.966667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":108,"posted_date":"2010-03-16T20:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Modou Gadiaga","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":50000,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":8333.33},{"due_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":8333.33},{"due_date":"2010-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":8333.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":8333.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":8333.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":8333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":20.83,"local_amount":8333,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T10:16:25Z","rounded_local_amount":9945.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129036689,"comment":null},{"amount":20.84,"local_amount":8333.66,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:35:44Z","rounded_local_amount":9946.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136759280,"comment":null},{"amount":20.83,"local_amount":8333.33,"processed_date":"2010-05-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:15:59Z","rounded_local_amount":9945.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144790791,"comment":null},{"amount":20.83,"local_amount":8333.33,"processed_date":"2010-06-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:25:26Z","rounded_local_amount":9945.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151971226,"comment":null},{"amount":20.84,"local_amount":8333.33,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:16:16Z","rounded_local_amount":9945.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159708498,"comment":null},{"amount":20.83,"local_amount":8333.35,"processed_date":"2010-08-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T11:40:52Z","rounded_local_amount":9945.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166922551,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-03-16T20:55:48Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T11:40:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":184883,"name":"Luis Enrique","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nLuis tiene 36 a\u00f1os de edad, es soltero y vive junto a su madre en el distrito de Monsefu, una zona que es conocida por dos actividades principales: la artesania y la panaderia, este lugar esta ubicado a 20 minutos de la ciudad de Chiclayo.\n\nDesde hace cinco a\u00f1os es propietario de una panader\u00eda.

Une zone constitu\u00e9e d\u2019un milieu assez original caract\u00e9ris\u00e9 par des dunes et des d\u00e9pressions souvent inond\u00e9es par l\u2019affleurement de la nappe phr\u00e9atique et par un climat assez favorable. Ce milieu n\u2019a pas manqu\u00e9 d\u2019attirer la population et de donner \u00e9galement \u00e0 la r\u00e9gion toute sa vocation agronomique.\r\n  Monsieur N. a pratiqu\u00e9 le mara\u00eechage depuis 20 ans sous l\u2019influence de son p\u00e8re qui s\u2019y activait.  En fait Monsieur N. aidait son p\u00e8re d\u00e8s  son jeune \u00e2ge aux travaux de mara\u00eechage jusqu\u2019au moment  o\u00f9 il prit l\u2019initiative de d\u00e9velopper sa propre activit\u00e9 le commerce.  Cette activit\u00e9, dit-il,  lui a permis de tisser des relations avec le monde ext\u00e9rieur.\r\n C\u2019est ainsi en 2009 lorsqu\u2019U-IMCEC a ouvert une mutuelle pour mieux aider les producteurs de cette zone que Monsieur N. est devenu membre et sollicite pour la premi\u00e8re fois un pr\u00eat de 50 000 FCFA. Il veut acheter avec le cr\u00e9dit des sacs de l\u00e9gumes (pomme de terre\u2026.) qu\u2019il va revendre sur le march\u00e9. Avec ce cr\u00e9dit  il va constater son revenu augment\u00e9.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alex Jaffe, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"deleted","funded_amount":25,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":506699,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"s'approvisionner en l\u00e9gumes destin\u00e9s \u00e0 la vente","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"THIES","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.783333 -16.966667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":108,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Modou Gadiaga","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":5000,"loan_amount":25,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":833.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4.17},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4.16},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4.17},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4.17},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4.16},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":184892,"name":"Mohamed","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mohamed K. is a driver and a local food market supplier.

Life in urban areas of the Dominican Republic can be rough, with no potable running water, frequent power outages (if one has power to begin with), and inadequate access to healthcare, among other dangers.

Currently, the school is staffed with 12 teachers and has 550 pupils.\r\n\r\nThis is the second loan these teachers are accessing from SMT\/Kiva lenders.  School staff from this institution, like many other schools' staff within SMT\u2019s operational areas, come to SMT to apply for loans. With the help of these loans, they can accomplish certain tasks that they would otherwise not have been able to accomplish with their mere salaries alone. But with the help of this loan, some can pay school fees for their children; others can use the loan to buy pieces of furniture, a plot of land, house-building materials, or to invest in business. At the end of each month, these teachers can repay the loan out of their monthly salaries. The institution\u2019s bursar is directly responsible for deducting the repayment and pays SMT on their behalf.\r\n\r\nMabel C. who is pictured second from right is the leader of this group of teachers.

She is the treasurer of the ALCANCIA COMUNAL \"SAN CARLOS,\" which has been working with EDAPRSOPO-PROSPERIDAD for nearly one year and five months.\r\n\r\nShe has been making slippers for more than 15 years.  Her business is small now, but it has not always been this way.  Filomina tells us that two years ago, on her husband\u2019s initiative, they decided to associate themselves with a friend of his.  They were going to open a shoe making business, since her husband\u2019s friend knew something of business.  Unfortunately, the partnership broke up after one year, so they decided to continue on their own, since they also knew something about doing business in the marketplace.  Things got a bit difficult when the city compelled them to formalize their business and they required papers and permits that took much time and money to obtain, but they got them.  Once formalized, they were required to pay minimum wage, tips, insurance, etc.  They were not prepared to pay these costs, so the business went broke.\r\n\r\nHaving had a bad experience, they moved and started over.  Their children helped with a small, but significant amount of labor.  They helped them move their machines and materials to their new shop.  She is convinced that, \u201cOne can fall, but with effort and support from one\u2019s family, one can rise again.\u201d\r\n\r\nFilomena also rents out the first floor of her home to earn an extra income.  Her plans for the future are to pay for her children\u2019s career education, to finish building her house, along with fixtures and finishing touches, and also to grow her business.

Her children's education is this admirable woman's greatest challenge. Both of them have illnesses that require specialists. She has a special needs son (next to her in the photo) and the other child has a skin disease. She is always watching over them; that is why in order to take care of them she works from her home with a small variety and refreshment store. She works all day, whenever the customer needs her.  She hopes and prays with much faith for a miracle from God: their recovery. \r\n\r\nShe began her business in 1994 and this is her fourth loan from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. She has demonstrated her excellence in making payments according to schedule. She is applying for the amount of  $2.000.000 to buy beverages, clothes, shoes and cosmetics and to fix her display case.  She has various suppliers of her products, among them, magazine distributors, stores from downtown Baranquilla and the Cervecer\u00eda \u00c1guila truck. This is a very important brewery of the Baranquilla tradition. She has a variety of clients, including neighbors, referrals, workers, friends and family. She maintains the business in the face of strong competition in her neighborhood with prompt and conscientious service.  In addition, the three loans that she has received in the last two years has allowed her to buy a display case, to pay bills and to accredit the business for merchandise. In the future, she dreams of having a locale with a well outfitted store. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ellen Donohue, Kiva

His greatest dream is to be able to buy a house in order to give his wife and son a better qualify of life.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Molly Puglisi, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":506811,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"Buy thread and canvas to make caps.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lagunas - M\u00f3rrope - Lambayeque","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2010-03-15T23:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Candelario","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":107.92},{"due_date":"2010-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":106.63},{"due_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":108.8},{"due_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":116.37},{"due_date":"2010-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":118.85},{"due_date":"2010-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":120.65},{"due_date":"2010-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":126.59},{"due_date":"2010-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":130.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":134.28},{"due_date":"2010-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":139.21},{"due_date":"2011-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":142.76},{"due_date":"2011-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":147.27}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.57},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.1},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.89},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.58},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.24},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.41},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.23},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.05},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.34},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":39.57,"local_amount":107.92,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:45:40Z","rounded_local_amount":111.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128934690,"comment":null},{"amount":39.1,"local_amount":106.63,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:09:15Z","rounded_local_amount":109.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136662314,"comment":null},{"amount":39.89,"local_amount":108.8,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:07:09Z","rounded_local_amount":112.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144695018,"comment":null},{"amount":42.67,"local_amount":116.37,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:38:20Z","rounded_local_amount":119.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151878063,"comment":null},{"amount":43.58,"local_amount":118.85,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:50:38Z","rounded_local_amount":122.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159618091,"comment":null},{"amount":44.24,"local_amount":120.65,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:02:10Z","rounded_local_amount":124.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166832493,"comment":null},{"amount":46.41,"local_amount":126.59,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:56:55Z","rounded_local_amount":130.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172099100,"comment":null},{"amount":97.15,"local_amount":264.95,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-16T10:43:15Z","rounded_local_amount":272.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177554542,"comment":null},{"amount":157.39,"local_amount":429.24,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:46:32Z","rounded_local_amount":442.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182529987,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-03-18T14:46:29Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T13:46:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":184954,"name":"Ada Zila","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ada Zila es una mujer joven.

La Granja is a commune, which is located in the area south of the great Santiago, the capital of Chile.  It belongs to an urban territory with houses and important businesses having to do with wood, factories, and metals.\r\n\r\nThese members work at different independent businesses like making clothes, a bakery, a pastry shop, handicrafts, decoupage (decoration of objects like wooden boxes, bottles, and pictures), greengrocery, grocery store, hair salon, making and repairing footwear, and preparing and selling fast food.\r\n\r\nCarolina was the member that was interviewed.  She is the secretary of this group.  In the photo you can find her in the last row to the right.  She is wearing a short sleeve orange t-shirt.  She sells vegetables and prepared salads in her house.  She will use the loan to buy bags for the salads and vegetables.  Also, she will save to buy a used light truck to purchase merchandise. \r\n\r\nHer dreams are to have a kiosk, which would also serve as a convenience store within the same field (greengrocer), and to have a stall in a fair.  Her great desire is to improve her quality of life, increase her earnings, and contribute to the family expenses.  For example, she would like to help buy her mother\u2019s medications.  Her great motivators are her small son and a small niece that she is raising.\r\n\r\nCarolina told us that when she first started working with Fondo Esperanza she was afraid of being a guarantor for people she did not know (the colleagues in her group because this is the Fondo Esperanza\u2019s system).  Driven by her projections and dreams, she dared to participate in these loans.  The results have been very satisfactory because she has felt supported and secure.  She also says that there is a great deal of solidarity among the members of the group.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

Junto a grandes \"quintas\", propiedad de terratenientes y personas de mayor poder adquisitivo en Santa Cruz, conviven los propios habitantes de la zona, con construcciones mayormente sencillas (adobe y techo de motac\u00fa). Existe una diferencia entre las poblaciones de Santa Rita y Santa Marta 1 y Santa Marta 2, que se encuentran al borde de la carretera antigua a Cochabamba, donde se encuentran viviendas de ladrillo y teja junto a las m\u00e1s sencillas, y las poblaciones campesinas que se encuentran hacia el interior de la monta\u00f1a, que son puramente de adobe y motac\u00fa, con condiciones mucho m\u00e1s sencillas, donde no llegan el agua y la luz.\nEstas poblaciones se encuentran a una distancia de entre 5 y 20 kil\u00f3metros hacia el interior (en la zona pastoral que deben atender los voluntarios). Dicha zona pastoral est\u00e1 compuesta de 9 comunidades, a las que se accede por caminos de tierra por los que a veces pasan vagonetas para poder acceder a ellas.\n\nLa econom\u00eda de la poblaci\u00f3n se basa en la producci\u00f3n agropecuaria y frut\u00edcola, as\u00ed como el trabajo de extracci\u00f3n de piedra, ripio y arena del r\u00edo Pira\u00ed que circunda a todo el municipio.

es la cuarta secci\u00f3n municipal de la provincia Santi Iva\u00f1ez, del Departamento de Santa Cruz. Est\u00e1 dividida en cuatro cantones con 65 comunidades campesinas.  De acuerdo al \u00faltimo censo realizado el a\u00f1o 2002, la poblaci\u00f3n de El Torno alcanza a 40.000 habitantes.\nEs una poblaci\u00f3n joven, constituida por emigrantes venidos del interior del pa\u00eds: del occidente, quechuas, aymaras y de los valles del oriente, as\u00ed como de las personas aut\u00f3ctonas.\nComo caracter\u00edstica de Santa Cruz, existen grandes diferencias sociales que conviven en un mismo espacio. Junto a grandes \"quintas\", propiedad de terratenientes y personas de mayor poder adquisitivo en Santa Cruz, conviven los propios habitantes de la zona, con construcciones mayormente sencillas (adobe y techo de motac\u00fa). Existe una diferencia entre las poblaciones de Santa Rita y Santa Marta 1 y Santa Marta 2, que se encuentran al borde de la carretera antigua a Cochabamba, donde se encuentran viviendas de ladrillo y teja junto a las m\u00e1s sencillas, y las poblaciones campesinas que se encuentran hacia el interior de la monta\u00f1a, que son puramente de adobe y motac\u00fa, con condiciones mucho m\u00e1s sencillas, donde no llegan el agua y la luz.\nEstas poblaciones se encuentran a una distancia de entre 5 y 20 kil\u00f3metros hacia el interior (en la zona pastoral que deben atender los voluntarios). Dicha zona pastoral est\u00e1 compuesta de 9 comunidades, a las que se accede por caminos de tierra por los que a veces pasan vagonetas para poder acceder a ellas.\nLa econom\u00eda de la poblaci\u00f3n se basa en la producci\u00f3n agropecuaria y frut\u00edcola, as\u00ed como el trabajo de extracci\u00f3n de piedra, ripio y arena del r\u00edo Pira\u00ed que circunda a todo el municipio. Tambi\u00e9n existe una gran actividad de comercio, especialmente en la poblaci\u00f3n de El Torno, donde se instala el mercado en que se venden los productos del trabajo campesino.\n\nEl Sr. Lauro primero trabajo en alquiler o al partido (trabaja para el due\u00f1o de la tierra y despues se parten la cosecha) saco un credito de EMPRENDER para comprarse 2 hectareas de tierra ahora el esta trabajando en su propia parcela y espera un credito  para seguir comprandoce mas parcelas de tierra osea 2 hectareas mas y asi poder sembrar Papa para luego ir a comercializar en el mercado de la zona, esta agradecido con Emprender y Kiva por la confianza brindada en la otorgacion del credito.\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n","en":"Lauro was born in Mojocolla Chuquisaca, on the 24th of July, 1981.  He has been living and working in San Luis El Toro for the past eight years. (El Toro is the fourth section of Santi Iva\u00f1ez province in the Santa Cruz department.)  It\u2019s divided into four areas with 65 rural communities.  The last census in 2002 showed that the population of El Toro was 40,000.  The population is young and includes many people who have relocated from other parts of the country.\r\n\r\nMany social differences exist in Santa Cruz.  There are large luxurious homes collocated with homes of simple construction (adobe and thatch).  There is a difference among the populations of Santa Rita and Santa Maria 1 and 2, located along the ancient Cochabamba road, where there are brick and fabric homes located alongside simpler homes.  The people living more into the mountain have simpler adobe homes with no running water or electricity.\r\n\r\nThese people are located between 5 and 20 kilometers to the interior (in the pastoral zone that must be serviced by volunteers).  This zone consists of nine communities, accessible via dirt roads.  Wagons sometimes pass through.\r\n\r\nThe economy of the region is agriculture based, as well as on stone and river sand extraction from the Pirai river, which encircles the entire town.  There is also a large business activity, especially in El Torno, where the rural population\u2019s products are sold. \r\n\r\nLauro first worked as a sharecropper (he worked for the owner of the land and then splits the harverst with him).  He got a loan through EMPRENDER so that he could buy two hetaeras of land which he is now working.  He is asking for this loan in order to buy 2 more hectares of land and be able to raise potatoes to later sell in the market.  He is grateful to EMPRENDER and Kiva for trusting in him and for granting this loan.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Hugo Reyes, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":506870,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Farmland\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lauro Claudio \t\t","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":700,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2011-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":175}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":175,"local_amount":175,"processed_date":"2010-06-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:39:00Z","rounded_local_amount":175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151879803,"comment":null},{"amount":175,"local_amount":175,"processed_date":"2010-09-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:57:20Z","rounded_local_amount":175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172100779,"comment":null},{"amount":175,"local_amount":175,"processed_date":"2010-12-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:55:27Z","rounded_local_amount":175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188668631,"comment":null},{"amount":175,"local_amount":175,"processed_date":"2011-03-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:51:57Z","rounded_local_amount":175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201272984,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-04-06T20:33:10Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T10:51:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":184971,"name":"Reina Rocio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Reina Roc\u00edo R.

This bank was set up in the community of Ingapirca, which is located 45 minutes outside the city of Cuenca.  Their community is the location of the famous archaeological ruins of Ingapirca, and is also known for its lush vegetation and unique scenery that attracts tourists from all parts of the country and the world.  The members of the community make a living through farming, though the young people have migrated to the city in search of better job opportunities and the chance to improve their economic and social situation.\r\n\r\nLigia Roxana B. is one of the youngest members of the communal bank.  She is 19 years old, is in a common-law marriage, and is the mother of a 2-year-old daughter.  Her husband works in construction, and together they built their own house, which Ligia is very proud of.\r\n\r\nLigia works as a domestic servant Mondays through Fridays from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m.  She also makes a living raising chickens, which she sells either dressed or live to her neighbors in the community, and which she also uses for household consumption.\r\n\r\nThis is Ligia\u2019s second loan with the Espoir foundation.  She used her first loan to start her chicken farm, and will use the money from the current loan to purchase fencing material, which she will use to make an enclosure and increase the number of birds on her farm. \r\n\r\nLigia\u2019s goal is to keep working so that she can improve her economic situation and achieve a better quality of life for her whole family.\r\n\r\nLike Ligia, Tania wants to improve her situation and help her family.  She is 18 years old and is in a common-law marriage, and is raising a son who is only nine months old.  Her husband works in construction applying stucco and primarily works on ceilings.  She and her family do not have their own home, but instead live in the house of Tania\u2019s in-laws.  Tania makes a living looking after children in a daycare center.  She has had this job for one year, and works from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.\r\n\r\nTania is grateful to her sister-in-law for inviting her to join La Inmaculada communal bank.  The group is made up of cheerful men and women who are all fighters, and who are looking after the welfare of their families.  She is now in her second loan cycle, and will use the money from this loan to purchase chickens and to purchase vitamins and feed so that she can start a chicken-raising business.\r\n\r\nTania\u2019s goal is to study dressmaking so that she can work in her home and spend more time with her baby, and thus help her family more.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Christopher Knutson,

This district, characterized by having the majority of its population in rural areas, is located a half-hour from the city of Chiclayo.  Two years ago, Paula installed in her home a small business selling groceries; the idea for the business came from her need to increase her income, since her husband works in agriculture, which cannot generate a regular income.  Her business enjoys much popularity thanks to the quality of the products she offers and the good treatment provided to her clients.  In a short time, Paula's business has become known and is growing.
