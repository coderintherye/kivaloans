Even so, he has managed to build a business making and selling ceramics.  He works 7 hours a day and sees up to 15 customers a day.

She works as an accountant at the Village Association of water users and, as an additional source of income for her family, runs an animal husbandry business.  Having started in 2004 with an initial sum of 5,000 som (KGS), Damira was able to develop her business to yield 8,000 som (KGS) per month from sales of milk and dairy products.  Today, her business contains three dairy cows, three horses and fifty sheep.  The earnings from this business allowed Damira to pay for her children's university education.  In order to further grow her business, Damira requested a loan in the sum of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to purchase additional heads of livestock.  She plans to invest the profits into increasing livestock headcount further.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":997073,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kuyruchuk village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-01-31T16:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-01T16:10:03Z","loan_amount":2150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Damira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"loan_amount":2150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2013-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1075},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1075}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-01-31T21:14:20Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":387414,"name":"Sonaiym","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0421\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0438\u043c 33 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430, \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043c, \u0432\u043e\u0441\u043f\u0438\u0442\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0442\u0440\u0435\u0445 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439 -

She has been working as a nurse for a long time and now is retired. Meylikan is engaged in animal husbandry and crop-farming which are a source of income for her family.

She sells a variety of merchandise, especially footwear, bags and clothing. In addition, she sells fast food in the doorway of her house. Two years ago she also began selling repair parts, washing machines and refrigerators.  Experience has taught her to accommodate her customers\u2019 requests: in order to identify her lines of merchandise she keeps an eye on the things they request that she does not have in stock, and, making a note of them, she buys these items and in this way constructs her own marketplace. She operates her merchandise business every day, offering either credit or an installment plan, while she sells fast food, such as hamburgers, skewered meat and other treats on weekends in order to earn additional income quickly and energize both businesses.\r\n\r\nCurrently she is getting ready for the coming Carnival season when people are happy and spend money lavishly, a situation she capitalizes on to make her best sales. Nevertheless a large part of her working capital is in the hands of her customers who bought on credit so that she does not have enough available to adequately respond to the demand. Consequently she approached the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo to apply for a Kiva loan. She will use it to buy clothing, footwear and supplies for her food business, an investment that will be successful because she responds to demand and the more she sells the greater her earnings and profit. \r\n\r\nHer goal is for her business to prosper and her greatest desire is that her family will always remain united\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":994896,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy clothing, footwear and supplies for her food business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad-Atlantico","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-01-31T23:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-01T23:10:03Z","loan_amount":650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Del Carmen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1130000,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":74775},{"due_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":84430},{"due_date":"2012-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":86400},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":88416},{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":90479},{"due_date":"2012-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":92590},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":94751},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":96962},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":99224},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":101539},{"due_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":103909},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":116525}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.01},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.57},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.7},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.86},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.04},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.26},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.5},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.78},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.07},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.41},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.77},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.03}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-02-01T05:55:35Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":387031,"name":"Diego","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Diego, tiene la edad  de 27 a\u00f1os, est\u00e1 casado,  vive  con su hijo y su esposo que son su prioridad.

Diana Lizet is 24 years-old and lives in a common law marriage with her husband. They have two boys and one is in elementary school and the other is in preschool. She sells catalog underwear and asked for the loan to buy bras, blouses, pajamas, panties, and bikinis. She began her business four years ago by means of an invitation from her aunt. Her husband supplied her to buy her first orders. Her business is important because it gives her earnings for her children and she is proud to be able to buy things for her home herself.
