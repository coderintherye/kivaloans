Thus, he\u2019ll be able to earn more trust from his customers.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":337057,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Carpentry","sector":"Construction","use":"To buy lumber","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TG","country":"Togo","town":"Ago\u00e8","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"8 1.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":111,"posted_date":"2009-06-17T17:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kodjo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":250000,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":18639.9},{"due_date":"2009-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":19012.7},{"due_date":"2009-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":19392.95},{"due_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":19780.81},{"due_date":"2009-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":20176.43},{"due_date":"2009-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":20579.96},{"due_date":"2010-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":20991.55},{"due_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":21411.39},{"due_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":21839.61},{"due_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":22276.41},{"due_date":"2010-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":22721.93},{"due_date":"2010-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":23176.36}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.01},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.83},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.66},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.52},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.39},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.28},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.18},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.11},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.05},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.01},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.99},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.97}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":41.01,"local_amount":18639.9,"processed_date":"2009-07-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T21:00:53Z","rounded_local_amount":19229.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63264256,"comment":null},{"amount":41.83,"local_amount":19012.7,"processed_date":"2009-08-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T23:51:27Z","rounded_local_amount":19614.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73705221,"comment":null},{"amount":42.66,"local_amount":19392.95,"processed_date":"2009-09-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T05:19:32Z","rounded_local_amount":20006.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87134787,"comment":null},{"amount":43.52,"local_amount":19780.81,"processed_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T08:48:55Z","rounded_local_amount":20406.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97049046,"comment":null},{"amount":44.39,"local_amount":20176.43,"processed_date":"2009-11-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T15:23:42Z","rounded_local_amount":20814.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103894662,"comment":null},{"amount":45.28,"local_amount":20579.96,"processed_date":"2009-12-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T18:16:41Z","rounded_local_amount":21231.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110783268,"comment":null},{"amount":46.18,"local_amount":20991.55,"processed_date":"2010-01-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-28T09:17:36Z","rounded_local_amount":21655.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118170285,"comment":null},{"amount":47.11,"local_amount":21411.39,"processed_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:36:33Z","rounded_local_amount":22088.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":124009290,"comment":null},{"amount":198.02,"local_amount":90014.31,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T10:18:00Z","rounded_local_amount":92862.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129038599,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-06-17T19:57:56Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T10:18:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":115654,"name":"Susana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Susana Amoako, 43, is married with five children: two daughters and three sons.

This is 33 year old Jennifer M. from Mbeya. She is married with two children between the ages of 1 and 4. Additionally, she is responsible for supporting two dependents because their parents can\u2019t take care of them. \r\n\r\nJennifer has been running a \u201ckuku\u201d business since 2006. \"Kuku\" is Swahili for chickens. Raising kuku is a popular micro-business in Tanzania, especially amongst SELFINA clients, for a number of reasons. One of the many reasons is that they require little start-up capital. You can start with one or two, and either add to them as you go, or wait for them to multiply naturally! Another reason is that they require little space, so sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. \r\n\r\nJennifer works at the business for 4 hours per day, 6 days per week and is assisted by her two young sisters. She currently earns about 700USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan in order to buy feed for her chickens. In the future, she plans to increase the quantity and the range of her business. Jennifer thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

Amongst other projects, he built the house where they all live with his own hands. They really appreciate the amount of effort he puts in every day. He started work 30 years ago as a construction foreman building houses on contract in the area where he lives. He is well known for his efficient work. \r\nAs a young man, he learned this trade from his father and has been perfecting it ever since.  The work requires much physical strength because he has to carry various kinds of construction materials, and to operate very carefully each of the machines that he uses.

This is his ninth loan with Kiva partner MFP. The enthusiasm and cooperation amongst the members of his group have been determining factors in the growth of the community bank.

Since she was very young, doing craftwork has given her pleasure and while she learned to do them she also got involved in making clothing. Later she specialized in being a tailor, since she considered this activity to be very beautiful because of the elegance of the dresses that she made. She has been practicing this trade for twenty years in her own home, taking notice that the requests have always been increasing in number due to the quality of her work. In her business, the profitability is based on the high prices that she charges, due to the quality of the fabrics with which she works and the finishing job that she does.

This is why since about 3 years ago she has been managing the business, including the purchasing of materials and the finishing work on some furniture pieces; the fabrication of furniture is done by people whom she employs. The fact that the shop is located in her home is very helpful, because it helps her to be on top of the day-to-day activities, such as the control of deliveries and purchases, as well as giving her the ability to be available for clients at any time during the day.\r\n\r\nIn a not to distant future, Marcela would like to increase the number of machines in order to expedite the work so that her children, who have already learned this trade, can help her with production.\r\n\r\nThis is her ninth loan with Microfinanzas PRISMA, and it's been about five years that she has been working with her peers from the community bank, who always maintain a cordial and harmonious mutual relationship.

Eupemia is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional fish to sell. This will be the sixth loan taken out by Eupemia from GDMPC.

She usually buys various kinds of flowers from farmers, making them into bouquets and selling them retail, while walking around the village. <P>\r\n\r\nKim T. is married with three kids who are attending school, while her husband works driving a motorcycle taxi.  Because their current income is not enough for their family\u2019s daily expenses, Kim T. would like a loan of US$ 300 in order to buy piglets to raise. This will provide her with additional income to meet her family\u2019s needs and provide more financial stability. The other borrower is Mr. Sem S., who is asking for a US$ 300 loan as well. He wants it to add to his savings to replace his existing motor that has broken.

and has 2 children.  He works as a plaster master and earns a decent income.  However, his work is seasonal and is only in demand during the warm months of the year.  Thus, in order to supplement his income, Abdukodir keeps livestock.  Every month, he buys and sells livestock and likes this type of business.  His son takes the livestock to pasture.  Abdukodir leaves the livestock there during spring and summer.  They have a cowshed there, where the livestock is kept until end of autumn.  Abdukodir also planted corn and other agricultural cultures on several hectares of land.  Before winter, he will dry these plants and use them as feed for his livestock. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Anna Sorokina-Hailey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":337477,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase of 4 cows","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Kostakoz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.198611 69.81","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":"2009-06-19T02:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abdukodir","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":220.95},{"due_date":"2009-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":228.68},{"due_date":"2009-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":236.69},{"due_date":"2009-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":244.97},{"due_date":"2009-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":253.55},{"due_date":"2009-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":262.42},{"due_date":"2010-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":271.6},{"due_date":"2010-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":281.14}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.48},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.31},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.21},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.18},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.22},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.32},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.78}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":52.48,"local_amount":220.95,"processed_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-06T11:03:07Z","rounded_local_amount":230.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63216004,"comment":null},{"amount":54.31,"local_amount":228.68,"processed_date":"2009-08-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-10T10:27:13Z","rounded_local_amount":238.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73645471,"comment":null},{"amount":56.21,"local_amount":236.69,"processed_date":"2009-09-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-14T09:17:18Z","rounded_local_amount":247.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87085085,"comment":null},{"amount":58.18,"local_amount":244.97,"processed_date":"2009-10-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-04T09:31:14Z","rounded_local_amount":255.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97001319,"comment":null},{"amount":60.22,"local_amount":253.55,"processed_date":"2009-11-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-25T09:22:33Z","rounded_local_amount":264.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103846459,"comment":null},{"amount":62.32,"local_amount":262.42,"processed_date":"2009-12-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-10T08:42:24Z","rounded_local_amount":274.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110737412,"comment":null},{"amount":64.5,"local_amount":271.6,"processed_date":"2010-01-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-06T08:21:27Z","rounded_local_amount":283.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118127087,"comment":null},{"amount":66.78,"local_amount":281.14,"processed_date":"2010-02-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-06T08:21:37Z","rounded_local_amount":293.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123964079,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-06-29T23:04:52Z","paid_date":"2010-04-06T08:21:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":115790,"name":"Rosita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosita A. is from the town of Plaridel.

The beekeepers are old friends of her husband; thus, Karomat is able to buy honey from them at a much better price than from other beekeepers.

Sayora has been making traditional dresses for three years.  She sells them during market days, which are normally Friday and Sunday.  She devotes the rest of the week to sewing dresses.

In 2000, together with her husband Shirmen, she started running a clothing business in a rental stall at Narantuul, the biggest four-season outdoor market in the capital city. She hires two tailors to make men's and women's coats and sport suits during the autumn, winter, and spring seasons. In summer, her eldest daughter helps her mother's business while having a vacation at home. \r\n\r\nNarantuya pays each tailor 200,000 tugrugs ($1 USD = 1450 MNT) a month.

She also pays her eldest daughter's tuition every year. Their customers are mostly students and herders.

She is 45 years old and the mother of four children, two of whom are employed in a garment factory while the other two are enrolled in the local school. She and her husband, Mr Yuon Sarin, are farmers who own a plot of land where they cultivate rice.

They are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. An EoT loan is AMK\u2019s main product because it is most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. The rest of the group members have monthly payment loans. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time. AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09% and AMK has a default rate of 0% on Kiva.

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Abdulaziz is a farmer. Previously he was a security guard. He grows potato, melon, and watermelon to earn the money necessary to feed his family and to provide all his children with an education. Abdulaziz has already been tilling the farm for seven years. His business has helped him pay school fees and buy the things they need like electricity, food, and water. Abdulaziz is asking for a loan of 5,000 TJS. He will use the loan to purchase seeds, fertilizers, and insecticides. The loan will really help him increase his yield.   \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions. But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

The goal of joining this group was to have permanent financial support so that she could make her dream of having a general store one day come true. In this way she believed she could increase the income from her business. <P>\r\n\r\nMarie began her business in 1991 with an initial capital of US$ 70. From 1991 - 2007, Marie acquired solid experience in selling sugar. Despite the pertubation of her business by the wars and political instability of the 90s in Kinshasa, Marie struggled to maintain her position by reinvesting her profits, working without cease, and by good management. She diversified her business thanks to various loans she received from Hope DRC, which she reimbursed in a timely fashion. <P>\r\n\r\nToday her business consists in buying and delivering tea, coffee, and soy to her customers. The loan that she received in this month of June was used to buy 1 sack of sugar, 1 sack of rice, and some milk to resell with the intention of  increasing her profit. Presently, her personal capital stands at US$ 180. Her business is bringing in US$ 40 per month. <P>\r\n\r\nMarie is 46, married and the mother of 7 children whose ages vary between 3 and 29. Four of them are enrolled in school. She does her business in an outlying and very populous neighborhood north of Kinshasa. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva

R. is 31 years old, a devoted mother living with her 3 children and her husband. She makes the most of an opportunity, such as when she started selling confectioneries in the food market of Isfara town. In this way, with the constant attention she gives almost all day long every day, she gets shoppers, which enables her to contribute to the home finances. This is an activity Zahro enjoys because she can rest from the hard labor in the countryside. She is motivated to do this work by the need to help support the family's finances, and she is able to take care of the education of her children who study in school. Zahro is requesting a loan with which she will invest in merchandise for her shop. She wishes to stock it with more products and offer the best every day. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to com,munities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions. But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This is the first time that he will use a loan to improve his crop yield and sales. Abdumutalib will use this loan to buy fertilizers and materials so that he will have a successful crop and he will then sell his production for the best price at the market.\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions. But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions. But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions. But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":337626,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","use":"To purchase hair pieces for beauty salon.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-06-16T22:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Revina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:40:57Z","rounded_local_amount":87333.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63233241,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-08-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:54:30Z","rounded_local_amount":87333.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73665034,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-09-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:48:30Z","rounded_local_amount":87333.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105746,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-10-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:29:12Z","rounded_local_amount":87333.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022856,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-11-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:42:31Z","rounded_local_amount":87333.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103868097,"comment":null},{"amount":66.65,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2009-12-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:45:03Z","rounded_local_amount":87333.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757293,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-06-17T14:20:29Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T16:45:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":115904,"name":"Eya","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Agricultrice tr\u00e8s dynamique et d\u00e9vou\u00e9e, Mme Eya K. est n\u00e9e en 1977 \u00e0 Nyigb\u00e9.

Client\u2019s business is to make women clothes and resell them to her customers. She works at the business for 8 hours per day, 6 days per week and is assisted by two employees. Monarisa currently earns about 130 USD from her business. She is requesting a loan of 400 USD in order to purchase another sewing machine. In the future, she plans to expand her business. Monarisa thanks you for her support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":337634,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"To purchase another sewing machine.

He is best known and acknowledged in his district, located in northern Kinshasa, for his beautiful photos.  He started his career in 1988 with a camera he had bought for $10.  From 1988-1997, the profits realized from photography helped him to prosper and to support him in secondary school, which he completed successfully.  In 1997, with his first camera now old, Claude bought a new one worth $80, thanks to accumulated profits and some savings.  From 1997-2006, his business prospered until his sales figures reached a total of $500.  Monetary depreciation, as well as the rise in market prices, caused by the war in the east of the Republic of the Congo, destabilized his business during this period of time.  \r\n\r\nIn 2008, Claude decided to join a HOPE RDC group named \u201cSanza Plus\u201d which means \u201cMoon\u201d, with the goal of opening a photographic lab one day for the photographers in his area.  He is a loyal client who has had several loans with HOPE RDC and who has repaid all of them completely and on time.  Given his growing number of customers, the last loan he received this June enabled him to buy some film for bolstering his inventory and some batteries to sell in order to grow his profits.  He currently has $150 in capital, and his business generates for him a profit of $25 a week.  \r\n\r\nClaude was married in 2007.  He is the father of two children, ages 4 months and 2 years old. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva

Pulatoy and her husband, Bahodur Kobilov, have been involved in livestock feeding for about 4 years.  The husband buys the livestock at a low price from shepherds and, having fed it for several weeks, sells the livestock at the livestock market in the Jabbor-Rasulov district.

Samuel presta toda su atenci\u00f3n y cuidado a sus cultivos, puesto que sabe que gracias a ello adquiri\u00f3 un carro con el que ahora trabaja haciendo transporte de carga desde las chacras hasta el pueblo y eso le genera otro ingreso econ\u00f3mico.

Her dream is to have a handicrafts store where she can sell her knitting.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2250,"image":{"id":337917,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Expand their businesses","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Huancavelica","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.766667 -74.983333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2009-06-18T21:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maximiliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eugenia Natividad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elizabet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ventura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nidia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teofila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nemesio German","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Olga","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Geovanna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nancy Alejandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yudith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Antonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":6700,"loan_amount":2250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1116.65},{"due_date":"2009-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1116.65},{"due_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1116.65},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1116.65},{"due_date":"2009-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1116.65},{"due_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1116.75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":374.99},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":374.99},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":374.99},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":374.99},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":374.99},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":375.05}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":375.11,"local_amount":1117,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T13:34:39Z","rounded_local_amount":1127.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63171447,"comment":null},{"amount":374.87,"local_amount":1116.3,"processed_date":"2009-08-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T14:52:25Z","rounded_local_amount":1126.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73596745,"comment":null},{"amount":374.99,"local_amount":1116.7,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T16:58:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1126.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87032132,"comment":null},{"amount":1125.03,"local_amount":3350,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-26T08:59:54Z","rounded_local_amount":3380.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96944450,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-06-19T21:34:10Z","paid_date":"2009-11-26T08:59:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":116043,"name":"Marisa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Marisa, pertenece al Banco Comunal \u201cLa Mujer Riojana\u201d, vive en el Departamento de San Mart\u00edn.

B. is from the village of Biasong. She is 35 years old. Elmar is married and has four school-aged children. To make a living, Elmar operates a fishing business. The main source of income for the business comes primarily from harvesting and selling ocean-caught fish in the local community. Elmar has been engaged in her business for more than three years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Elmar joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Elmar has successfully repaid a previous loan of 20,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase fishing equipment, including hooks and nets. Elmar is requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP to invest in expanding the business. This will be the seventh loan taken out by Elmar from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

B. is from the village of Biasong. She is 37 years old. Leonor is married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Leonor owns & operates a manufacturing business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from manufacturing & selling clay products to local businesses and community members. Leonor is just starting this business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Leonor joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Leonor has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase raw materials to manufacture additional products. Leonor is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional raw materials to expand her product offerings. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Leonor from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

T. is from the village of Biasong. She is 37 years old. Noralyn is married and has five school-aged children. To make a living, Noralyn owns & operates a fishing business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from harvesting & selling ocean-caught fish in the local community. Noralyn has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Noralyn joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Noralyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to invest in expanding the business. Noralyn is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP, which will be used to purchase fishing equipment including hooks & nets. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Noralyn from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is married and has two children. She sells children's clothing on the clothing marketplace of the Jabbor-Rasulov region. She used to sell men's clothing. She started this business because all of her family's expenses rest on her shoulders so that she can provide for her children's good education and improve their quality of life.
