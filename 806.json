He is a farmer and a shopkeeper.  Francisco is married, and has one 22-year-old son who is studying.  He started  selling products when he was 25 years old and used to travel from Managua to Le\u00f3n to sell clothing.  He would get up very early and take the first bus to the city of Managua where he would buy merchandise to sell in Le\u00f3n.  He gradually acquired customers and got to know where he could obtain his merchandise more cheaply and how he could attract more customers.  He managed to use his profits to set up a small, humble grocery store which his wife runs though he doesn't neglect his farming work.  Through his two businesses, he has supported his family.  Francisco will use his loan to buy basic grains, cleaning products, oats, soups, bread and canned food.  He will also buy seeds and fertilizers for his vegetable crops.  He would like to gradually expand his grocery store with a variety of products that people in his community really need.

This caused her to be more frustrated because they were very supportive of her. Above all, the downfall of her business due to armed robbery further worsened her condition.\r\n\r\nShe joined GHAPE in 2003 and owns an off-license in mile two Nkwen where she also sells cooked food.

She is positive her business will succeed because of the longevity of the business in a good business site, and because she has regular customers who are ready to buy from her. The community will benefit from the supply of drinks on occasions like wedding ceremonies, as well as death celebrations, which are more frequent in her community.\r\n\r\nShe says with the profit from the loan she will educate her children, provide for medication and also plow back part of the profit.

The Mazahua culture still predominates in this community, where the women wear Mazahua traditional clothing and speak Mazahua. Luci, as her friends and family call her,, is married to Antonio, and they have five children, named Alexis, Marco Antonio, Mercedes, Edgar, and Diana. The last two are in secondary school, and the youngest, Alexis, is in primary school. \n\nLuci sells seasonal fruits that she grows, and she makes typical clothing of the Mazahua culture, which she has been selling in her community for more than 20 years. She says that she is applying for a loan for the purchase of organic fertilizers and for insecticides, since she has a number of avocado, peach, guava, and black cherry trees. She also sometimes grows manzano chile peppers, radishes, and tomatoes at her house, since she has ample land, and when it is the harvest season she says that she sells her fruits and vegetables in a central area in her community. She says that she has been in this business a little more than 5 years and that she did well when she set it up, since it gives her good earnings and thus she can give her children a better quality of life and help her husband with the household expenses. She is very happy because through the loans she has set her sights every higher, and little by little she is making her dream -- to have an orchard in good condition -- a reality. One of her goals is to buy a vehicle, which will facilitate the transport of her fruits and vegetables, since she pays freight charges to transport what she grows. \n\nThe other three members of the group are Gonzalo, Jose Juan, and Aucencio, who will invest their loans in seasonal fruits and vegetables and groceries."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1017088,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"to buy organic fertilizers and insecticides, since she has a number of avocado, peach, guava, and black cherry trees, as well as manzano chile peppers, radishes, and tomatoes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Zitacuaro, Estado de Michoac\u00e1n.","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-03-13T20:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-12T20:30:04Z","loan_amount":1950,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gonzalo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jose Juan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aucencio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":25000,"loan_amount":1950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1847.53},{"due_date":"2012-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1887.39},{"due_date":"2012-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1928.11},{"due_date":"2012-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1969.71},{"due_date":"2012-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2012.21},{"due_date":"2012-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2055.63},{"due_date":"2012-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2099.98},{"due_date":"2012-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2145.29},{"due_date":"2012-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2191.57},{"due_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2238.86},{"due_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2287.16},{"due_date":"2012-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2336.56}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":144.11},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":147.21},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150.4},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":153.63},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.96},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":160.34},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":163.79},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":167.34},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.94},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":174.63},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":178.4},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":182.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-03-16T20:46:50Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":398718,"name":"Mujeres Trabajando Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Este grupo se llama Mujeres trabajando esta conformado por trece mujeres trabajadoras que se dedican a la venta y elaboraci\u00f3n de ropa t\u00edpica.\nUna de las integrantes de este grupo es la se\u00f1ora Honoria una se\u00f1ora de sesenta y siete a\u00f1os de edad.\nElla se caracteriza como una se\u00f1ora trabajadora y alegre que desde peque\u00f1a a trabajado y a sabido como  cuesta llevarse el pan a la boca.\nElla se dedica a la venta de   dulces desde el m\u00e1s barato como el m\u00e1s caro se va a las fiestas de su localidad par que sus paisanos le compren sus dulces.\nElla nos cuenta que le gusta mucho vender sus dulces por que le deja buenas ganancias y desde hace diez a\u00f1os se ha dedicado a ala venta de dulces.\nPidi\u00f3 el pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de m\u00e1s dulces e hilos y manta para la elaboraci\u00f3n de ropa t\u00edpica ya que le gusta mucho tejer pero lo que mas le gusta y es su vida es la venta de dulces ya que le agrada mucho vender sus dulces por las calles de su comunidad.\n Las otras integrantes del grupo son:\nSof\u00eda-se dedica a la venta de ropa t\u00edpica.\nFrancisca Felisa  -

The name of the group comes from the fact that its meetings used to be held in a cabin belonging to one of the members.  Consuelo has a silk screen printing workshop which she has been running for ten years.  She makes calendars, agendas, posters, and prints thesis papers, t-shirts or mugs.  She also prints party invitations, brochures, etc.  She claims the business was started by her husband who taughter her how to use the machines to make letters, drawings, embroidery designs, etc.  She rents space for her shop since she does not have room at home for the machines.  The loan she is requesting is to buy ink, paper, bags, calendars and to pay for machine maintenance.  The loan will be very helpful because she has many thesis-printing orders this time of the year and she will be able to obtain the materials she needs for this.\r\n\r\nShe is married to Ra\u00fal and their adult children live independently.  Consuelo's goal is to open a shop in her house so she does not have to pay rent which is expensive and cuts into her profit.\r\n\r\nThe other 13 members of the group are Leticia, Maria del Rosario, Florentina, Maribel, Tomasa, Blanca Estela, Maricela, Martha, Isabel, Liliana, Reynalda, Sof\u00eda, and Alejandra.

This is her second loan with Hluvuku, in the amount of 20.000.00mt, which she will use to purchase construction materials for her home (iron, cement, beams, doors, metal panels, etc.).  The prior loan was for 11.000.00mt, also for her home.  She promises to make her payments as scheduled.  In the future she plans to complete her college education and intends to request additional loans from Hluvuku for that purpose. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1032470,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"to buy materials for her house; iron, cement, beams, doors, metal sheets, etc","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Boane, Maputo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-26.041667 32.325278","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":"2012-03-13T22:30:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-12T22:30:11Z","loan_amount":750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elsa Raul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":20000,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":768.01},{"due_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":800.01},{"due_date":"2012-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":833.34},{"due_date":"2012-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":868.06},{"due_date":"2012-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":904.23},{"due_date":"2012-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":941.91},{"due_date":"2012-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":981.15},{"due_date":"2012-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1022.04},{"due_date":"2012-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1064.62},{"due_date":"2012-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1108.98},{"due_date":"2013-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1155.19},{"due_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1203.32},{"due_date":"2013-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1253.46},{"due_date":"2013-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1305.69},{"due_date":"2013-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1360.09},{"due_date":"2013-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1416.76},{"due_date":"2013-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1475.79},{"due_date":"2013-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1537.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.8},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.55},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.91},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.32},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.8},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.32},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.93},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.58},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.32},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.13},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.97},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.13},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.34},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-03-14T01:07:17Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":400733,"name":"Angeles Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El grupo Angeles lo conforman tres personas trabajadoras y emprendedoras una de ellas es Aracely del Carmen quien se dedica a la venta de calzado desde hace 5 a\u00f1os.

His mother makes cultural handicrafts, and is part of a very well organized group in this town, which is what inspired Humberto to sell artisinal products.\r\n\r\nHe and his wife both work in his business, which is a handicrafts business authorized by the \"Servicio Nacional de Aprendizaje\" [\"National Apprenticeship Service\"], or \"SeNA\" for short, organization.  SeNA is a state organization for educational development for technical and technological careers.  For this reason, they do not just sell handicrafts from their own culture, but also those from other regions of the country.\r\n\r\nHe is currently applying for this Kiva loan because he is preparing a good inventory of hammocks, bags, and backpacks.  The loan will allow him to purchase supplies in greater volume, buying yarn for hammocks, a packet of fine yarn for bags and backpacks, and also skeins of agave fiber.  With this he will be able to make ten hammocks and fifty bags, and use the rest for the backpacks.\r\n\r\nThe success of this investment lies in the fact that he will not need to purchase products as other suppliers do, which normally happens due to growing sales, but he will have a supply of stock to offer for sale.
