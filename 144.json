They live in extended traditional families with co-spouses and other relatives in the Kimparana village (Prefecture of San, 4th administrative region in the Republic of Mali). Linked by socio-economical bonds, their main business is food-serving, but they also sell condiments and fruits. Anxious to satisfy and ever-increasing clientele, the members of the group decided to join the loan program of Soro Yiriwaso a year ago. After a first solidarity loan repaid without problems, the  group is now seeking a second loan to be used to buy 100 kg of rice and a large amount of various condiments.\r\nThey purchase raw materials in the grand market of Koutiala, from wholesale resellers, and in Kimparana during fair days.

Olga is the coordinator of the group.  She started her business to be able to help her husband with the family expenses and to give a better quality of life to her son.  She began four years ago helping a neighbor to sell shoes and later decided to sell them on her own obtaining good results.\r\n\r\nLeonor started the business because back then her desire was to have a business in her home and that way be able to give the necessary attention to her children.  It's for that reason that approximately 15 years ago she started making and selling arrangements and handicrafts for holidays.  She now also sells gifts and makes handicrafts at very economic prices and that allows her to have many clients.\r\n\r\nDiana started this business in order to help her husband economically.  She started by selling shoes by catalog more than a year ago because a neighbor recommended that and now she sells to her friends and neighbors.\r\n\r\nThese women need a loan for $850, which they will repay in four months, to purchase merchandise and to be able to continue with their businesses.

Her business is located in Leon where she has worked for the past 20 years.  She started the business in order to help out with family expenses; her husband had the idea to start a business they could invest in to support the family.  She was able to start the business in spite of the economic difficulties her country was facing thanks to her hard-working spirit and her desire to start a worthy, respectable business.  She decided to invest in selling used clothing, purchasing small quantities depending on her orders.  She would like to buy clothing in larger bundles since it would cost her less than how she is currently purchasing.

She started out selling \"marcianos\" (a traditional sweet) but because she's always looking for ways to generate more revenue from the business, she jumped in to selling material for building small fishing boats and nets.

Mrs. Rith S. makes baskets in the local village. Her husband, Mr. Suk Sao, is a fisherman who gathers a little fish to support his family. <p>\r\nMrs. Rith S. is 41 years old and the mother of three children, one of whom is a fisherman. The others are enrolled in the local school. Although Mrs. Rith S.'s family members have different businesses, they still live in an old house with a leaking roof. In order to repair this roof, Mrs. Rith S. has decided to ask for a loan to buy zinc strips to replace the old roof. <p>\r\n\r\nAll of the members in this village bank have end-of-term (EoT) loans, so they are not required to pay aN. principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK\u2019s main product because they are the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. These allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to. Most clients start to make payments maN. months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time.

She considers herself a hardworking, intelligent and entrepreneurial person.\r\n\r\nToday she is asking for a loan for USD $450, which will be repaid in 6 months, to buy used clothing. Anabel began selling used clothing out of necessity. As a single mother, she has two children, and never received support from the father of her children. Anabel had to get additional income to her regular job, as she works for a cell phone company, however many times that income alone doesn\u2019t cover all her and her children\u2019s necessities, so she wanted to have her own business.\r\n\r\nAnabel began selling a few years ago, beginning with selling well-known brands of cosmetics to her coworkers. But two years ago a friend encouraged her to sell used clothing, above all children\u2019s clothing, as they could make good earnings and her friend helped her acquire used clothing to sell. This is how in January of 2005 she started the business  she has today, first selling to neighbors and friends, and today she also sells on Saturdays and Sundays in the street markets. Today she orders her bundles of used clothing over the internet and they are shipped to her. In addition she sells used shoes and bags to provide more variety to her customers.\r\n\r\nI invite you to support Anabel to continue growing her business!\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Cindy Kendall, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":218538,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"Buy used clothing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Tampico, Tamaulipas","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"22.216667 -97.85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":16,"posted_date":"2008-10-25T21:20:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-09T00:07:12Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":6000,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2008-12-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-20T08:59:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1008.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9891855,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-01-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-21T08:56:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1008.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14815084,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-02-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:16:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1008.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20349889,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-03-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T08:59:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1008.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27037161,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-04-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T09:36:13Z","rounded_local_amount":1008.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35927578,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-05-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-05T10:20:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1008.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44382701,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-10-25T23:07:12Z","paid_date":"2010-12-05T10:20:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":71796,"name":"Ana Amelia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ana inici\u00f3 el negocio para poder  ayudar  en los  gastos  familiares, es madre de un ni\u00f1a de 6 a\u00f1os y un ni\u00f1o de 1 a\u00f1o, ya que como su esposo trabaja por su cuenta  a veces no le iba bien y batallaban econ\u00f3micamente, adem\u00e1s de los imprevistos como cuando se les enfermaba alguno de sus hijos, es por eso que  ella decide emprender un actividad  por su cuenta para tener un ingreso extra.

Mr. Mov H. is the father of three children, two of whom are employed in a garment factory, while the youngest one is attending the local school. Although, Mr. Mov H.\u2019s family members are involved in different businesses, they still do not have enough money to support their field when they face problems. Therefore, Mr. Mov H. has decided to ask for a loan to buy a water pumping machine. He hopes to increase his income and improve his living conditions with this loan.

He works as a nursing assistant and has two children: the oldest is 8 years old and is in second grade, and the youngest is 4. His wife also works as a nursing assistant and together they share household expenses. It's important to mention that since Lucas was very young he has supported his mother. He started working at a young age since his family has limited economic resources, and carried out his work with a lot of responsibility. He feels happy with his job because he helps many people in the Jacinto Baca region. He's studying for a nursing degree, and it's worth emphasizing that this young man is characterized by his modesty and humility, but he posses a strong desire for personal improvement. He aspires to become an excellent professional so he can continue helping his family and the entire community. His goal is to little by little improve his quality of life and that his family lacks nothing.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva

Sarorn N., 29, earns about $1 per day raising and selling pigs. She is married to Mr. Nhean Sopheap and has two young children who are in school. Her husband is a rice farmer who also sells carving wood. He earns about $7 per day.
