It is not daily or monthly, but depends on the yield resulted. That\u2019s why, Sayu Putu Narmi, a wife of a farmer, is required to help her husband to fulfill their family\u2019s daily needs. She uses her skill to sew that she got before she got married to open a tailor. She deployed Rp 1,000,000 as the initial capital to purchase a sewing machine and several pieces of cloths. She started by sewing \u201ckebaya\u201d and \u201ckamen\u201d as ordered by the customers. With limited capital, Sayu Putu Narmi only earn small income, which can only be used for buying kitchen supplies. Even though they oly have one child, they need more than Rp 20,000 a day for living.\r\n<p>\r\nUsually, Sayu Putu Narmi receives more orders before Galungan and Kuningan celebration. She sometimes has to refuse orders because she does not have enough resource to purchase clothes, for the costumer do not want to bring their own, but to purchase from Sayu Putu Narni. Fortunately, Dinari Foundation is willing to help by giving loan that enable Sayu Putu Narni purchase more materials so she is able to provide clothes with various color and printing. With the loan, Sayu Putu Narni hopes that her business can be improved, that she can hope for increased income she can save for her future.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Indonesian by Hestyana, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nMempunyai suami  petani tentu saja penghasilannya tidak menentu ,karena pengasilan petani tidak bisa setiap hari atau setiap bulan,ini tergantung dari panen berhasil atau tidak.Oleh sebab itu Sayu Putu Narmi dituntut bisa menambah pendapatan keluarga makanya ketrampilan yang dibawanya  sebelum menikah bisa diterapkan setelah Sayu Putu Narmi menikah. Dengan modal awal sebesar Rp.1.000.000 ,Sayu Putu Narmi memulai usahanya sebagai seorang penjahit,dengan membeli 1 buah mesin jahit dan beberapa lembar kain,ia membuat baju kebaya maupun kamen jadi sesuai dengan pesanan masyarakat. Dengan modal yang sedikit tentu saja keuntungan yang didapat juga sedikit dan itu hanya cukup untuk keperluan dapur saja. Walupun hanya mempunyai satu orang anak ,namun biaya yang dikeluarkan setiap hari cukup banyak yaitu Rp.20.000 hanya untuk dapur saja,belum keperluan yang lainnya. Biasanya usaha Sayu Putu Narmi akan ramai saat menjelang hari raya Galungan dan Kuningan,Sampai ia tidak mampu melayani pelanggan karena kekurangan modal untuk membeli bahan baku seperti kain kebaya atau kamen,karena yang menjahit tidak mau membawa sendiri,dan langsung membeli kain pada Sayu Putu Narmi. Untunglah Yayasan Dinari membantu memberikan pinjaman modal sehingga Sayu Putu Narmi bisa tetap menjalankan usahanya dan sekarang bisa menyediakan kain dalam jumlah yang lebih banyak dengan motif dan warna yang beragam.Dengan pinjaman yang diberikan oleh Yayasan Dinari Sayu Putu Narmi berharap usahanya semakin ramai dan berkembang,sehingga keuntungan yang diperoleh menjadi meningkat, karena  Sayu Putu Narmi rindu untuk bisa menebung sebagai bekal di hari tua

She is married with three children.  As her kids grow, they needs less taking care of, therefore she has more spare time for side activities.  To fill her spare time, she started a small kiosk by renting a spot near her home with starting funds of $120, and she can earn up to $3.5 to $4.5 daily. After the rent contract was over, she moved the business to her home as she felt it was more practical.  Now one of her child has finished school while the other two are still in school so she still has a lot of tuition to pay for.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>As her business grows, her clients are demanding her to carry more variety of goods.  She wants to increase her offering.  She started her business by only selling light snacks and soft drinks, now she wants to carry other household goods such as rice, cooking oil, sugar, etc.  However, she does not have enough fund.  She hopes DINARI loan may help her expand her business and earn more profit.\r\n\r\n<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Indonesian by Kresna Hartandi, Kiva Volunteer<\/p><\/b>\r\n\r\nKegiatan sebagai ibu rumah tangga yang selalu sibuk mengurus suami dan tiga orang anak membuat Gusti Ayu Kade Gunarsih terbiasa dengan kehidupan yang dipenuhi kesibukan. Kemudian seiring dengan bertambahnya usia anak-anaknya, kesibukannyapun semakin berkurang, sehingga banyak waktu yang dimilikinya untuk kegiatan lainnya. Untuk mengisi waktu luangnya Gusti Ayu Kade Gunarsih membuka warung kecil dengan menyewa sebuah tempat di dekat rumahnya dengan modal awal Rp 1.000.000,- dan   keuntungan yang bisa diperolehnya berkisar Rp. 30.000,- sampai Rp. 40.000,- per hari. Setelah masa sewa tempat berakhir Gusti Ayu Kade Gunarsih memindahkan usahanya ke rumahnya karena dirasanya lebih mudah dalam pengelolaannya. Kini setelah satu anaknya menyelesaikan pendidikannya tinggal dua orang anaknya yang masih bersekolah menjadi tanggungannya bersama dengan suaminya.\r\nSemakin hari usahanya mulai berkembang dan dirasanya kebutuhan masyarakat disekitarnya semakin bertambah.  Niatnya adalah menambah jenis dagangannya yang semula berupa makanan dan minuman ringan dan beberapa jenis kebutuhan rumah tangga dengan menjual kebutuhan pokok seperti beras, minyak, gula dan sebagainya namun modal yang dimiliki tidak mencukupi. Kemudian ada bantuan pinjaman yang diperolehnya dari DINARI dan ini  membuatnya bersemangat dalam mengelola usahanya karena omzet penjualanyapun tentu akan bertambah"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":146089,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

He is married with 4 children who are all school-going. He buys the clothes in bulk from Nairobi and transports them to Kisumu for retailing. He has been in this business for over 5 years now. One of his primary motivations for choosing this business is because of the readily available market due to the high poverty levels in Kisumu town.\r\n<p>\r\nHe buys his stock every 2 weeks and sells the clothing not only in Kisumu Town but also in neighboring markets on the outskirts of Kisumu. He goes to these markets on their specific market days.\r\n<p>\r\nThe post-election violence in Kisumu Town affected him negatively as it meant he couldn\u2019t sell his clothes for quite sometime. There was, however, an opportunity for him as well in this situation since most people now can\u2019t afford to buy new clothes and have to rely on second-hand clothes for survival. He hopes to take advantage of this opportunity by taking a refinanced loan to enable him to carry on with his earlier business. His business had been making profits before the violence enabling him to frequently restock his business and pay his loan as well. His loan repayments have been on schedule and so have been the group repayments.\r\n<p>\r\nHe has been the secretary for his group and has done a good job particularly in ensuring that the group has its loan balances kept intact. The group has also been cohesive and with good repayment rates before the post-election violence. They see the refinancing as an opportunity to get back to their normal business state as soon as possible.\r\n<p>\r\nIn addition to being cohesive, the group has had good repayment rates in earlier loans and have been having timely meeting on their rescheduled meeting days. Solomon, in addition to his secretarial duties, has played a huge role in energizing the group through constant faith-based encouragements during the violence period.\r\n<p>\r\n<i>\r\nDisclaimer: Kiva is working with OI-WEDCO to refinance businesses disrupted by Kenya's post-election violence.  The group above has received loans from OI-WEDCO in the past and is now working to rebuild their businesses and to get back on their feet. Due to recent events in Kenya, the security situation in many communities remains unsettled, affecting many local businesses. Lenders to this entrepreneur should be aware that this loan may represent a higher default risk, and should be willing to accept this additional risk in making their loan.<\/i>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3300,"image":{"id":146114,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To reconstruct and expand businesses after post-election violence","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kisumu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.1 34.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":92,"posted_date":"2008-04-02T13:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Solomon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Charles","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dennis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joanes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jared","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joab","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dems","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fredrick","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-04-19T13:32:28Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":205000,"loan_amount":3300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":34166.67},{"due_date":"2008-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":34166.67},{"due_date":"2008-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":34166.67},{"due_date":"2008-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":34166.67},{"due_date":"2008-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":34166.67},{"due_date":"2008-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":34166.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":550},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":550},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":550},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":550},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":550},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":343,"local_amount":21307.58,"processed_date":"2008-05-06T03:23:49Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:25:44Z","rounded_local_amount":21368.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201923,"comment":"Dear Lender,\r\n\r\nStage Hera Kende Self-Help Group has repaid $343 of its loan to Kiva lenders.

At the moment the paddy plants are 4 month old and they are ready to be harvested in a month time. The money from the harvest will be used to pay the fertilizer and seeds he bought last time. For the next planting season, he wants to plant a high quality paddy field so he can improve the quality of his paddy harvest and also to reduces the maintenance costs as high quality paddy plants requires less maintenance works and also less vulnerable to plaque compares to regular paddy seeds. \r\n<p>\r\nWith the loan money, he will be able to wisely finance his next farming season to get a better harvest and enable him to repay on schedule.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Indonesian by Antonius Gunadi, Kiva Volunteer. <\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\r\nI Wayan Badra, 40 tahun, berprofesi sebagai seorang petani yang mengerjakan sawah miliknya sendiri seluas 1.5 hektar. Dengan luas lahan tersebut, I Wayan Badra mengerjakan pengolahan sawahnya dengan dibantu oleh istri dan 2 orang tenaga kerja yang dibayar Rp. 25.000.- per hari.

Saat ini umur padinya sudah 4 bulan dan sebulan lagi sudah siap dipanen. Semua hasil panen akan dipergunakan untuk membayar pupuk dan bibit yang sudah dibelinya pada masa tanam yang lalu. Saat ini I Wayan Badra merencanakan akan menanam bibit padi jenis unggul agar kwalitas beras yang dihasilkan lebih baik dan biaya perawatan bisa ditekan karena bibit padi jenis unggul lebih tahan terhadap penyakit.

need funds to pay for school expenses. That is why I Gede Suendra works on his brother's rice fields, while he is stationed in an outer island. The land he worked on is about 1 hectare. Because of subak (local rules) which is good in Pangkung Buluh village, now is I Gede Suendra's time to plant rice. As a tenant farmer whose life is very simple, to process a 1 hectare land, I Gede Suendra did not have enough funds. Especially if planted with local seeds, and non maximal maintenance, he is afraid that the results would be very unsatisfactory, and his efforts wasted. That is why I Gede Suendra requested a loan from Dinari Foundation. This loan would be used to buy superior rice seeds, fertilizer, and also insecticides, and to work the fields by rented tractor power, since I Gede Suendra does not own a cow to plow the rice field. He hopes that the upcoming harvest would bring good results, so that his profit would increase. From this profit,  I Gede Suendra wished to be able to provide schooling for his children, enough to be able to support his household expenses, so that I Gede Suendra could have a happy family.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Gwan Liong Ang, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nUntuk bisa menopang perekonomian keluarga I Gede Suendra,harus bekerja agar mendapatkan penghasilan,apalagisekarang anak-anaknya sedang membutuhkan biaya untuk bersekolah.Oleh sebab itu I Gede Suendra menggarap sawah milik Saudaranya yang kebetulan bertugas di luar pulau.

the sake of her food kiosk business, Istikomah lives in her kiosk in Dermaga Pangembangan area, West Bali. Her regular customers are fishermen who just come back from the sea. Her kiosk opens 24 hours because there are always customers who come to the kiosk. The most crowded time is around 2pm to 8pm when fishermen just arrive in the shore and they directly go to her kiosk for having breakfast or buying take-away food.  \r\n                        When DINARI entered the area, Istikomah was fortunate to get a loan from DINARI. She uses the loan for buying the raw materials for her food kiosk. She usually buys the food materials in the market. Her net profit can reach Rp. 100,000 per day when many customers come to the kiosk and during the fish season. Istikomah uses the profit for helping her husband and for adding her family's income.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Kustini Lim, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nDemi menjalankan usaha warung nasinya, Istikomah rela menginap diwarungnya yang ada disekitar Dermaga Pengambengan, Bali barat. Pelanggan warung nasinya adalah para nelayan yang baru tiba dari laut setelah mencari ikan di laut lepas.Warung dibuka selama 24 jam karena ada saja pelanggan yang datang berbelanja di sekitar dermaga. Saat- saat paling ramai adalah pukul 14.00 s\/d 20.00 wita setelah nelayan sampai di darat  dan langsung ke warungnya untuk makan pagi setelah semalaman melaut maupun untuk bekal makanan dalam bekerja ditengah  laut untuk mencari ikan. \r\n                        Pelayanan Yayasan DINARI sampai di daerah tersebut dan akhirnya Istikomah mendapat kepercayaan dan memperoleh dana pinjaman. Dengan dana pinjaman tersebut Istikomah pergunakan untuk menambah modal usahanya yaitu untuk berbelanja segala keperluan usaha warung makannya.untuk berbelanja lauk pauk yang dilakukannya hari dipasar. Keuntungan bersih dalam sehari mencapai Rp.100.000.-  jika situasi sedang ramai dan musim ikan. Dari keuntungan inilah Istikomah dapat meringankan beban suaminya untuk menambah pendapatan

He has run this business for quite some time. After he got all the materials, Kadek Rustika travels around with his motorcycle to sell the merchandises. He sells various kinds of vegetables, meats, fishes, cakes, and also ready-to-eat food. Kadek Rustika usually starts traveling at 5 to 8 am to meet his regular customers. His regular customers are housewives who live quite far from the market.\r\nBased on the information from his relatives, Kadek Rustika applied for a loan from DINARI foundation. Kadek Rustika used the loan to add more capital and to cover sales expenses. In a day, Kadek Rustika spends about Rp. 250,000 to Rp. 300,000 for sales expenses. His net profit is about Rp. 30,000 to Rp. 40,000. Kadek Rustika uses the profit to cover his family expenses.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Kustini Lim, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nKadek Rustika setiap pagi harus bangun pagi sekitar pukul 03.00 wita dan harus bergegas ke pasar pagi di kotanya untuk berbelanja keperluan dagangannya.Usaha dagang sayur memang sudah ditekuni sejak lama. Setelah barang dagangannya lengkap, Kadek Rustika berkeliling dengan sepeda motornya untuk menjajakan barang dagangannya.\t \r\nBarang barang yang di jual yaitu aneka macam sayuran hijau untuk keperluan masak, daging, ikan, aneka macam kue, aneka macam sayur yang sudah dimasak dan dibungkus dengan plastik. Biasanya  Kadek Rustika mulai berkeliling pukul 05.00 s\/d 08.00 wita menemui pelanggannya.  Pelanggannya adalah ibu-ibu yang ada di daerah pedesaan yang jauh dari pasar .\t\r\nMelalui informasi oleh saudaranya akhirnya Kadek Rustika mengajukan permohonan untuk mendapatkan pinjaman dana dari Yayasan DINARI. Dengan dana  itulah Kadek Rustika memakainya untuk tambahan modal usaha dan memenuhi keperluan usaha dagang sayur keliling. Dalam sehari Kadek Rustika membelanjakan dana sampai Rp. 250.000.- s\/d Rp. 300.000,- yang terpakai untuk keperluan usaha dagang sayur keliling. Dengan keuntungan bersih mencapai Rp. 30.000 s\/d Rp. 40.000,- Dengan keuntungan inilah kadek Rustika dapat mencukupi keperluan keluargnya bersama seorang

Buying in bulk is cheaper and saves us on the cost per item. \r\n<p>\r\nMy group members who are also in need of loans are: Suriya N., who wants to payoff the remaining money she owes for her donkey cart; Ameera B., who needs this loan for her husband\u2019s shopping-bag trade; and Yasmeen B., who is borrowing for her grocery store.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is a group loan and funds will be distributed among group members, each of whom will either invest in her own or her household's business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":146853,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"To buy pipes, bolts and other related materials for the repairing business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PK","country":"Pakistan","town":"Borewala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"30.719444 70.997222","type":"point"}},"partner_id":60,"posted_date":"2008-04-09T17:50:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kalsoom","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Suriya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ameera","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yasmeen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-04-26T07:39:37Z","disbursal_currency":"PKR","disbursal_amount":43000,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":3583.33},{"due_date":"2008-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":3583.33},{"due_date":"2008-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":3583.33},{"due_date":"2008-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":3583.33},{"due_date":"2008-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":3583.33},{"due_date":"2008-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":3583.33},{"due_date":"2008-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":3583.33},{"due_date":"2008-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":3583.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":3583.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":3583.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":3583.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":3583.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":59,"local_amount":3624.29,"processed_date":"2008-05-26T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T21:56:01Z","rounded_local_amount":3693.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":219955,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":59,"local_amount":3624.29,"processed_date":"2008-06-26T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T21:59:37Z","rounded_local_amount":3693.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":249084,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":59,"local_amount":3624.29,"processed_date":"2008-07-26T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T22:07:05Z","rounded_local_amount":3693.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":277734,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":59,"local_amount":3624.29,"processed_date":"2008-08-26T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T22:17:24Z","rounded_local_amount":3693.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":307194,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":59,"local_amount":3624.29,"processed_date":"2008-09-26T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-27T07:08:10Z","rounded_local_amount":3693.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":338249,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":55,"local_amount":3378.57,"processed_date":"2008-10-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-28T07:11:08Z","rounded_local_amount":3443.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":371690,"comment":"scheduled_repayment (late autopay posting for Asasah, a partner of Save the Children -
