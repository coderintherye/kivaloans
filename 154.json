This is the situation that Maria V. faces each day. She is living in extreme poverty, and her children have to work just so the whole family can eat. Nobody in the family has a steady income, and the whole family is just living day to day. Marie decided she wanted to change her situation, so she came to Esperanza International (Kiva's Field Partner) asking for a loan so she can start her very own business. She is planning on starting a small business selling used clothing. She is a very good seamstress, so she wanted to do something where she could use her talents. She is one of the rare women in her situation because she is still able to dream. She dreams of sending all 4 of her children to college someday, and she knew that if she wanted that dream to come true she would have to change her life. She feels that having her own business is the way to realize that dream. She is a hard worker and ready to take on this challenge. She is going to be a success someday, and her whole family is going to benefit from

The challenge is to manage their cultivation, as during the flowering he has to care for the fruit of all the trees and for this he needs fertilizer.  \r\n\r\nLorenzo is in his fourth loan cycle from MFP, and has not had any problems in making his repayments to date.  \r\n\r\nWith the loan he is seeking he will acquire traps for the insects that threaten to destroy the fruit that he has worked so hard to cultivate.

She works as a basket maker and her husband also works, but they do not earn enough income to support their family.  That is why Mrs. Rin S. has decided to apply for a loan to buy a cow and start a cow-breeding business. She hopes to increase income and improve her living conditions with this loan. She is 27 years old and the mother of three children, two of whom attend the local school while the third is too young to work or study. \r\n<p>\r\nThree members of this group have end-of-term loans, while the rest of have monthly-payment loans. The people in the first group are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the end of the term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK\u2019s main product because they are very beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor.

However, she needed to move on and was forced to apply for a loan in one of the institutions with a higher interest just to cope with the financial needs of her family. But it seems that they were abused by the financial institution; many of her group mates had missed their payment and their savings was used to pay the unpaid balance. \r\n\r\nWhen ASHI encouraged her to take the opportunity to have a loan she was hesitant at first because of her bad experience. When one member of their area received a loan, she understood the advantage of joining the institution. She was encouraged to form a group and avail the chance of having capital. She had a proposal for Php5,000.00 to be used for a boat and fish net for fishing. She is looking forward to the utmost support.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":231042,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","use":"Fish Net &

O. is a 40-year-old member of Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc. Antique Southwest Branch, Antique Area, Philippines. She is the mother of five children and a wife who is really helping her husband just to sustain the daily needs of the family situated at the very poor Sitio of Poblacion Norte, where all families are excluded in terms of opportunities.\r\n\r\nShe is married to a native man who worked as a \u201csacada\u201d, a hired laborer on the sugarcane plantation. He works almost 24 hours a day just to save for his family. Being the wife of a laborer is so difficult because a daily income can not sustain even three meals and the education of her children. Evangeline believes that education is a key to change people\u2019s lives, and she does not want to let her children experience what she has experienced.\r\n\r\nEvangeline has many dreams to achieve despite the many criticisms she has encountered because of their miserable situation. This situation sometimes leads her into depression and she worries that there is no hope to rise from poverty. Only when ASHI arrived looking for the poor who want to get out of poverty, she smiled in accepting the new opportunity to have capital to start up a small business. She would like to buy a boat, to be used by her husband, and a sari-sari store for her. The amount of Php5,000.00 is a big amount for her to invest to achieve her dreams. The principles and teaching in compulsory group training is her way to move

a young age, Marilyn Palacios experienced many painful moments. She came from a struggling family and was not able to enjoy her childhood days playing games with her peers. Instead, she worked very had to provide income for food for her family. Because of this situation, she decided to get married, but her husband was also poor.\r\n\r\nMarilyn Palacios I. lives at Sitio Igcaputol, Poblacion Norte, Tobias Fornier and is blessed with five children. They live in a small house made of nipa shingles with some parts covered by empty sacks of fertilizer and cement. It is uncomfortable for them, especially when rains and typhoons come. They are trying their best to survive even though sometimes they cannot eat rice for a day. Her children are malnourished due to insufficient nutrient intake that results in sickness. \r\n\r\nAfter the meeting of Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc. she wished to join and start a business. But her neighbors don\u2019t want to join her because of their miserable situation. When ASHI staff motivated her to join, she was very thankful, full of tears and passion to have a small amount of capital to start making her dreams come true. She saw a bright future as she looked forward to the challenge of starting a business with a fish net and a boat to be used by her husband. An amount of Php5, 000.00 is sufficient for them to start anew with dignity and to achieve the respect of their

That  is why she is asking people who are concerned to provide capital to finance this business.

She hopes that the institution can help her achieve her greatest dream:  to send her daughter to school through college and to establish a habitable house.

Mang Jimmy was formerly employed in one of the piggeries in Bulacan owned by Lito Co. After four years in Bulacan, they decided to move to Antique to start a new life and to have their own business. They wanted to use and practice what Mang Jimmy learned while they were in Bulacan. But challenge came when Mang Jimmy was hospitalized. He was hit on the back by a falling coconut. Nanay Janeth was forced to find a job to support the family. She went to Manila and worked as caregiver for an elderly man, earning a salary of two thousand pesos a month. After six months, Mang Jimmy was fit to work again so they started their business. \r\n\r\nThey joined ASHI to have capital for fishing. Their first loan was used to purchase fishing material. With just a manual, simple way of catching fish, they were able to sustain their family's basic needs. \r\n\r\nTheir dream in life is to send their children to school through college and to have a sustainable business. They want to build a big Bangka for fishing and a piggery. Nanay Janeth also wants to help their relatives and friends and those marginalized and less fortunate people who dream of a better life. She wants to extend their business by buying dried fish in Antique and delivering it to her sister in Tarlac, who has a stall in the market.

She began her business selling staple grains and proceeded to sell rice, cooking oil, sugar, and beans. Her first business failed due to political instability.

Samnang L. is a farmer who lives in Preak Samroung village in Kandal Province. He owns a plot of land where he cultivates vegetables to earn a living. He faces an obstacle because he does not have enough money to buy corn seeds so he is requesting a loan $500 USD.

She is married and the mother of four children. Previously, Mukaram's lack of a stable job and the slow productivity of her husband's business as a traffic cop didn't leave enough money to pay the expenses of the home and of her children. This was the reason that Mukaram decided to start her own business four years ago selling the fabrics of the national dresses. Little by little she has made her business grow, and by allowing her clients to pay in installments she's seeing her orders get bigger. Now her business is running normally. However, she would like to continue bettering her household so that her situation will be stable in the future. She is asking for a loan of 3000 Somoni ($900) that she will pay back in four months. With this money, Mukaram will be able to buy seasonal fabrics for the national dresses and grow her business. The power to help her business grow is in your hands.\n\n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \n\nIMON's History\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

J. is 50 years old. She is married and the mother of 3 adult children. \r\n\r\nMuhabbat owns a clothing business at the local market in Dushanbe, Tajikistan. She has been running this business for about 10 years. Her business has benefited from a good sales location and constant demand for her products. Muhabbat tries to offer good prices to her customers while still making a profit. A normal monthly income from her business is around 1000 Somoni. \r\n\r\nMuhabbat has requested a loan of 3000 Somoni ($900 USD) for 6 months to increase her product inventory. This is a busy time for many market vendors because the cold season is coming and everyone is preparing for the winter season.

She\u2019s a very industrious woman who never stops selling fish from morning \u2018til afternoon every day.  She is a role model mother in her own right, having sent her 2 children to college where they have finished a course, while her 4 children are currently studying in high school.\r\n\r\nWhen she joined ASHI, she started with a loan in the amount of P5, 000 for fish vending but she now needs P10, 000 to start up a variety store with her next loan. She makes sure that her credit performance is always 100%. She wants to open up a variety store with school supplies because her house is very near the elementary school.  To start up a variety store she needs a working capital of Php 10,000 for her next loan to purchase of bulk quantities of school supplies.  \r\n\r\nShe wants to manage her own store and not suffer under the heat of the sun selling fish from house to house.  Through ASHI  Antonietta is hoping that her dreams will come true, especially to start up a variety store.

Mercedita Prado L., 40, is married to Mr. Ludy L., and presently resides at Brgy. San Francisco North, Tibiao, Antique Philippines.  She is a flexible mother and a plain housewife, a vendor of fruit and vegetables to help her husband support their family.  She enjoys buying and selling vegetables, her business with her first loan through ASHI in the amount of Php 5,000.  \r\n\r\nMrs. Mercedita is a cheerful mother as she faces those trials that come her way as she lives with her family.  Hunger and poverty are her inspirations because they teach her to be more responsible and strong to handle them.  As she says, \u201cbehind the poverty, opportunities comes along\u201d.  \r\n\r\nAs she was explaining her dreams in life, she felt very emotional, for example she did not finish her studies even in high school, so she doesn\u2019t want her children to be like her.  That is why even though she suffers a lot, she strives to send her children to school up to college level so that they can find a decent job.  \r\n\r\nOne of her greatest dreams in life is to start up a restaurant right in the town of Tibiao, Antique Philippines. She believes that only ASHI can help her to access a working capital of Php 10,000 from her next loan to start up a restaurant.  Through this loan, she can provide better education for her children and have a stable business for her family.

She got a one-year term to maintain a good credit rating performance. Because of their dreams, they feet that ASHI will provide a big capital in the near future that they will use in poultry farming so that they can become a supplier of many restaurants in the Municipality of Tibiao.

Betty Doroteo S., 52, is a resident of Barangay San Isidro, Tibiao, Antique Philippines. She was blessed with 7 children and six of them have already finished their studies and have a stable job now.  For Betty, education is very important that\u2019s why the couple did everything they could to earn more income just to send their children to school. Like others, she has also had experience with the many challenges of poverty. She mentioned that she  would have to wake up early in the morning  to harvest rice just so that they have something to feed their children. \r\n \r\nBetty used her first P5, 000 loan to open up a variety store. She gave her best to establish it and hopes to make it a mini-grocery store someday. She plans to request her second loan amounting to P 10,000 that she will use for this grocery. The sacrifices that she has encountered are her weapon to survive, i.e., through ASHI after a year she will begin to have a mini-grocery.\r\n\r\nHer greatest dream is to have a mini-grocery with refreshments situated at their home.   And if possible she can have a branch in the town proper of Tibiao in order to provide employment to others but she needs a working capital of Php 10,000 for her next loan.  Though this is her first time to join a micro-finance institution, she hope that these dreams will come true and that ASHI will in fact give the best direction and opportunity to all members.

Evelyn A., 33, is married to Mr. Henry A.. They are blessed with 3 children and reside in Brgy. San Francisco, Tibiao, Antique Philippines.  Currently they are living with her parents-in-law due to insufficient funds to build their own house.  \r\n\r\nLike others, Evelyn had terrible experiences earlier about completing her studies; she worked just to support her brother and sister, since she is the eldest in the family.  Since she has had a family of her own, she is still suffering from the different facets of poverty, especially financial problems.  Thanks to her industry and courage in facing those trials, she started up a variety store as one of her sources of income to cope up with the basic needs of her family.   \r\n\r\nOne of her greatest dreams is to send her children to school and have them finish their studies.  She also dreams of a stable business and even of having the working capital to become a wholesaler of rice and a retailer as well.  With these dreams she needs a capital of Php 10,000 for her next loan through ASHI.  Giving a chance to have a starting capital of Php 5,000 she aims to do her best to maintain her good performance in ASHI, since this is an opportunity, according to her.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":231959,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"variety

Belinda Montero E., 54, is a resident of Brgy. San Francisco North, Tibiao Antique, Philippines.  She finished her Bachelor of Science in Education and practiced her profession for almost 5 years. Unfortunately she did not continue teaching when she was separated from her husband because there was a third party involved with their relationship on her husband's side.  She now stands as a mother and a father for her six children.  \r\n\r\nBeing a single mother, many challenges and trials come into her life. One of these is a financial problem concerning the medical treatment for her son, who suffers from drug abuse.  She recalls those years when she baked bread and cooked dishes to sell in their neighborhood just to earn income to meet the basic needs of her family.  \r\n\r\nThose past experiences have made her become firm in the face of challenges.  Besides, despite being a single mom, she established her 5 children and sent them to school to finish college, and recently they have stable jobs. Being a responsible mother she felt her responsibilities for her children. Currently she wants to have working capital for her own business and not depend on them.  \r\n\r\nShe is hoping that someday she will be able to start up a restaurant or refreshment stand because she is a good cook but she lacks opportunities because of having no capital.  If she is given a chance and if somebody like ASHI is willing to grant her working capital of Php 10,000 to start with, she will do her best to expand her business and to show her integrity.

Presently they reside in the mountain site of San Francisco North, Tibiao, Antique Philippines.  Based on their experiences with poverty, she decided to work as a \u201csacada\u201d (plantation laborer) in Negros, Philippines.  \r\n\r\nWhen ASHI came to her area, explaining its purpose and vision for less fortunate women, she began to hope that ASHI can give her the opportunity to show her skills such as fruit and vegetable vending.  \r\n\r\nFruit and vegetable vending is a very common job for mothers just to cope with the needs of their family.  Delecia has a great dream that she could establish a business as a rice retailer with her own stand in the municipality of Culasi, Antique near the town of Tibiao, Antique Philippines.  \r\n\r\nTo realize this dream, she needs a working capital of Php 10,000 to purchase 10 sacks of rice for her business.  Mrs. Delecia has faith in God that she can achieve her dreams someday, if she has patience and is industrious.

She has worked in agriculture since she was very young, growing bananas and citrus fruits on a few hectares of land which she farms in rotation. When she harvests the fruit, she stores it in her house, packages it, and sends it to market in the city. She also grows coffee, which is seasonally very profitable. Bananas, on the other hand, are always inexpensive but never fail to provide good income. They are very profitable for her because every 15 days she can harvest from one farm or another, allowing her to send bananas to market each week.

Her business is selling live chickens, which she does with the help of her children. She learned the business at the age of seven from her mother, who is also a merchant in the same field.  She purchases chickens for 85 MT and sells them for 95 to100 MT. She is able to earn 5000 MT, of which she saves 2000 MT.\r\n\r\nThis is the first loan for Ermelinda from Hluvuku and Kiva.
