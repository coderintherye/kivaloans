She lives with her partner and is the mother of four children.  Flor raises and sells cattle.  Her herd is kept in the village of Utiquinios, which is located four hours downstream from the start of the Ucayali River.  Her partner leaves for a period of 15 days in order to take care of the cattle.  Meanwhile, Flor stays in the city and is in charge of selling the cattle and having feed sent to the village.  She has been in this line of work for approximately 10 years.  Flor enjoys this job because it has enabled her to have an income for taking care of the household expenses and providing an adequate education for her children.  She considers this business to be profitable because she buys the animals at a low price while they have yet to develop.  Once the animals have been fed and have reached a suitable weight, then they are sold at the local livestock fair at a higher price.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis will be her first loan with MFP.  Flor hopes to have everyone\u2019s support so that she can invest in her business.  In addition, she promises to be punctual with her payments.

In their 15 plots of land they sow coffee, corn, manioc, plantain, and other produce for personal consumption. \"Annatto is a product for which there is a lot of demand in the province of Chanchamayo\", she mentions. She herself considers this crop profitable because said plant is used for coloring cheeses and butters, and also as a main ingredient for making condiments.\r\nThe main problem she faces comes when the weather is bad, with too much or too little rainfall, and also when the price of her produce is down. Vacelisa and Venancio live harmoniously, but they wish that in time their 15 plots of land can be cultivated in their entirety.

Eight years ago she married Willy, the father of her only child, an 8-year-old son. She lives at her in-law's house.\r\nShe does mainly rural work, specifically sowing produce such as papayas, coffee, corn, ginger and plantains in the land she owns. Two years ago she opened a small grocery store at home in order to get more income for her family. With her own efforts, as well as her in-law's help, she has been able to support her son. Her husband is in the city of Lima working in music and for that reason he doesn't visit often.\r\nMeliza reports that coffee and corn sales are profitable and there is much demand for it in the town of Pichanaki. For lack of working capital, she can't sow her produce in the quantities she would like to. That's why she wishes to expand her harvests in her in-law's plot. With luck, next year she will build her house and expand her business.\r\nThis is the first time she receives a loan from MFP. For that reason she has great expectations for her work with the communal bank, in which she feels very comfortable and enthusiastic. With the loan she hopes to get, she will purchase coffee and ginger seeds. She will also use it to hire labor which is needed for farming.

Dornod borders the Russian boundary, and Batchimeg makes sales of livestock meat between Russians and Mongolian customers. She and her husband drive around and buy meat from suppliers in the countryside for lower prices. She has been running this business for many years and they have a lot of loyal customers, which make the business mutually efficient. \r\n\r\nA month ago she decided to start a new direction of her sales, selling things such as handmade leather shoes.

is a widow and 32 years old with 3 children.\r\n\r\nAnnie owns and operates a business venture, selling chips.  She has 2 years of experience in this business. Annie needs a loan of WST $1,000 to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale.  She plans to use the profit from her loan to improve the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Annie joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral.  This is Annie's 3rd loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"\"overall social metric score.\"\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"\"level of education\"\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem. Please join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD.

She owns and operates a business venture of planting and harvesting fruits and vegetables for sale.  She has many years of experience in this business.    \r\n\r\nShe needs a loan of WST $1,500 to purchase general farm supplies and equipment.  She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 300 talas or $125 per week) to improve the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Malia Paula joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"\"overall social metric score.\"\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"\"level of education\"\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

is Avelina, 48, resident of Silang Cavite, Philippines. She is married to Ordialyn, a jeepney driver, and is a mother to their two children. Both children already have their own families. She, together with her husband, is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nAvelina oversees operations of their jeepney (see footnote) transportation business. They have one unit (14-16 person capacity) jeepney, which pays boundary (daily quota) each day. Aside from this she also manages a small variety store in her place. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 800 every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy new accessories and spare parts and for the maintenance of their jeepney. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nAvelina hopes to add another Jeepney unit someday and hopes for a better future for her family. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where he can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n-Curiously, Jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain.

She owns and operates a business venture, planting and harvesting fruits and vegetables for sale.  She has many years of experience in this business.    \r\n\r\nShe needs a loan of WST $1,500 to purchase general farm supplies and equipment.  She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 300 talas or US $125 per week) to improve the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Maliumai joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral.  This is her 3rd loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"\"overall social metric score.\"\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"\"level of education\"\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

is 50 years old and is married with six children. She owns and operates a business venture selling ice-cake. She has three years of experience in this business. Talifaia needs a loan of WST 1500 to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 200 talas or $83 per week) to financially support immediate members of her family.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Talifaia joined SPBD to gain access to financial services. Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral. This is Talifaia's third loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers. Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is), and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from a university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self-esteem. Please join SPBD's lending team on Kiva to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD.

is Annalie, age 26.

She, together with her husband, manages their own household while operating her business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nAnnalie operates a computer rental shop. In the Philippines, very few people own their own computers. Thus there is a need for them, especially for students who need to do research and complete their papers. Annalie rents out computers by the hour and offers printing and typing services. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operation of her business, she is requesting a PHP 50,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy new computer units, spare parts and accessories needed in her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nAnnalie hopes to have another shop in their area and dreams of being able to give her children a good future and a high-quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the word of God, build social capital and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":979.17,"image":{"id":892724,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Computers","sector":"Services","use":"to buy new computer units, spare parts and accessories needed for her computer shop business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Pasay City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-10-17T13:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Annalie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":50000,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.41}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.95},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.95},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.95},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.95},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":146.87,"local_amount":6249.99,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:37:32Z","rounded_local_amount":6357.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238571867,"comment":null},{"amount":195.84,"local_amount":8333.01,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:31:37Z","rounded_local_amount":8476.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244529417,"comment":null},{"amount":244.79,"local_amount":10416.96,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:39:12Z","rounded_local_amount":10595.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250738633,"comment":null},{"amount":195.83,"local_amount":8333.04,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:48:35Z","rounded_local_amount":8476.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257145861,"comment":null},{"amount":195.84,"local_amount":8334,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:01:17Z","rounded_local_amount":8477.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263274869,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-10-17T17:33:19Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":345276,"name":"Eve","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Eve is a widow and she is 65 years old with 4 children.

This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"\"overall social metric score.\"\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"\"level of education\"\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

Celia hopes that her children will finish their studies with her financial support. \n\nTo help her husband in providing for the growing needs of their children, she began selling beauty soaps and other products like detergents, gas stove and umbrella. She sells her products to the people from her community.\n\nAside from her retailing business, she also maintains a hog-raising business. \n\nTo further grow both of her businesses, Celia is requesting a loan of Php 28,000 from Kiva lenders.

is 42 years old and married with 6 children. She owns and operates a business venture, selling chips.  She has 1 year of experience in this business.    She needs a loan of WST $1,000 to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale.  She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 200 talas or $83 per week) to improve the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Esa joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral.  This is her 1st loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"\"overall social metric score.\"\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"\"level of education\"\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem. Please join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD.

is married and she's 32 years old with 5 children.\r\n\r\nTelesia owns and operates a business venture, selling fish & chips.  She has 1 year of experience in this business.    Telesia needs a loan of WST $1,000 to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale.  She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 220 talas or $92 per week) to improve the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Telesia joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral.  This is her 1st loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"\"overall social metric score.\"\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"\"level of education\"\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem. Please join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD.

She owns and operates a business venture, selling fast foods.  She has 1 year of experience in this business.    Ana needs a loan of WST $1,000 to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale.  She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 250 talas or $104 per week) to improve the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Ana joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral.  This is her 1st loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"\"overall social metric score.\"\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"\"level of education\"\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem. Please join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD.

is 32 years old and married with 4 children. She owns and operates a business venture, planting and harvesting fruits and vegetables for sale.  She has many years of experience in this business.    Matalaoa needs a loan of WST $1,000 to purchase general farm supplies and equipment.  She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 250 talas or $104 per week) to improve the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Matalaoa joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral.  This is her 1st loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"\"overall social metric score.\"\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"\"level of education\"\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem. Please join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD.

She owns and operates a business venture, selling a variety of different products in the local community.  She has many years of experience in this business.    Asoono needs a loan of WST 2,000 to purchase additional products to sell.  She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 300 talas or $125 per week) to financially support immediate members of her family.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Asoono joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral.  This is her 3rd loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"\"overall social metric score.\"\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"\"level of education\"\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"\"overall social metric score.\"\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"\"level of education\"\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

is 18 years of age and married with no children. She owns and operates a business venture, selling a variety of different products in the local community.  She has 3 years of experience in this business.    \r\n\r\nShe needs a loan of WST 1,500 to purchase additional products to sell.  She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 300 talas or $125 per week) to improve the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Faatiu joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"\"overall social metric score.\"\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"\"level of education\"\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem. Please join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD.

She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 200 talas or US $83 per week) to improve\/expand it.<p>\r\n\r\nMost of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral.  <p>\r\n\r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"\"overall social metric score.\"\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"\"level of education\"\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  <p>\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD: <p>\r\n\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.

She says she opens her store at 5 o'clock in the morning due to many customers going to  their fields. She is grateful because she has a loving husband who has always supported her. Her husband has been a farmer and tricycle driver. The generated income of the couple has been used in buying a refrigerator, in payment for motorcycle transport, daily needs and the allowance of her child.\r\n\r\nTeresa had added products such as frozen foods and raw meat to her store because their village is far from the market. She has been buying her products wholesale to minimize her expenses going to and from the market. Nowadays, she suffers from shortage of funds due to some who have shopped on credit in her neighborhood.

He is a Palestinian National Authority employee with a decent salary. Jamal has a project  raising sheep and benefiting from the sale of their products. He wants to expand his project by purchasing more sheep in order to increase his income by selling more products. As he doesn't have enough money to pay for them, he needs to take a loan from FATEN. When Jamal gets the loan, he will be able to purchase more sheep and sell more products, thus increasing and improving his income to provide his family with better living conditions. Jamal is photographed in the picture.\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee.

She joined One Acre Fund in order to access fertilizer and hybrid seeds and ensure food security for her family. During the 2011 season, Eunice had a very good maize yield harvesting eight bags on one acre of land. Before joining One Acre Fund, Eunice was only able to harvest two and a half bags of maize on one acre of land. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, One Acre Fund will purchase fertilizer, seeds, and other important inputs to distribute to Eunice and her group during Kenya's next planting season in February 2012. The distribution of farming inputs is part of One Acre Fund's integrated agriculture package, which includes training, reliable input supply (such as fertilizer and seeds), credit and insurance. \r\n\r\nWith income from maize sales, Eunice will educate her children and ensure food security. \r\n\r\nIn 2012, the members of Lutaso Inyokha W group will have a mixture of very land-limited farmers (taking loans for one acre) and farmers who are taking on larger loans, including Eunice. The larger loans (for two acres or more) fall under One Acre Fund's \"Superfarmer\" program, which provides additional advice and training to farmers who plant larger plots of maize. \r\n\r\nEunice is pictured in the photograph together with her group members and the Field Officer at the far left in white. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":887455,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy farming inputs, such as seeds and fertilizer, at low prices for the 2012 planting season.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2011-10-17T19:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Beatrice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Catherine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"David","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eunice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Evans","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Violet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":117600,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2011-10-18T15:01:14Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":345429,"name":"Josephine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Josephine is 34 years old and lives in the Philippines.

She wants her pigs to be healthy and nourished in order to sell them for a higher price.\r\n\r\nShe is aiming to save enough money for the educational purposes of her four children. She trained well in this occupation and yet, she feels difficulty, especially when she lacks money to finance the needs of her pigs. Thus, borrowing working capital is a big contribution to her as a hardworking woman.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":892957,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy feeds

Before joining One Acre Fund, he was only able to harvest 6 bags of maize on 1 acre of land.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, One Acre Fund will purchase fertilizer, seeds, and other important inputs to distribute to George and his group during Kenya\u2019s next planting season in February 2012. The distribution of farming inputs is part of One Acre Fund\u2019s integrated agriculture package, which includes training, reliable input supply (such as fertilizer and seeds), credit and insurance.\r\n\r\nWith income from maize sales, George will pay school fees for his children and provide for general household maintenance.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, the members of Kiabii SHG group will each plant  between \u00bd and 1 acre of maize.\r\n\r\nGeorge is pictured with his group members in the photograph with their Field Officer on the far left in Black and Red.

The distribution of farming inputs is part of One Acre Fund\u2019s integrated agriculture package, which includes training, reliable input supply (such as fertilizer and seeds), credit and insurance.\n\nWith income from maize sales, Martin will educate his children, ensure food security, and invest in livestock rearing. In 2012, the members of Martin's group will each plant  between \u00bd and 1 acre of maize.\n\nPicture\nIn the picture the field officer is pictured standing on the far left.\n\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":888768,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To source farming inputs such as seeds and fertilizer at low prices for the 2012 planting season.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2011-10-27T09:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Angela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leonard","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bornface","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edward","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":42700,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42700}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":425}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2011-10-28T01:32:37Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":345463,"name":"Carmeliselda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Carmeliselda is 30 years old and has been engaged in a sari-sari (variety) store business for almost a year.

is 51 years old. She is married and has two children below 15 years of age. She lives in a seven bedroom apartment in Ntamulung, in Bamenda, Mezam Division of the North West Region of Cameroon. The major challenges she has faced in her life have been the lack of capital to start up her business, sicknesses in her family, the death of some close relatives like her elder sister and her aunts and uncles, and also when thieves broke into her house and made away with some of her valuables.\r\n\r\nShe joined Kiva's partner, GHAPE, in 2005 and has received and successfully repaid empowerment credits (ECs) four times. She invested her past ECs into frying and selling gateaux and also into poultry farming. She used the profits from these past loans to cater to her family, sponsor her children in school and to support her husband in the construction of their family house.\r\n\r\nWith the requested loan, she will stock up on red oil and vegetable oil, as well as buy fowls and pigs for her poultry and piggery. She strongly believes this business will be a success because she has so many customers already. This business activity will also be of great help to the community because it will increase the availability of ready-made food to the people in her area and their distance to the market will be reduced.\r\n\r\nWith the proceeds from this loan, she will be able to provide for her family, pay her children\u2019s school fees, and support her husband financially. She prefers a GHAPE loan because the interest rate is relatively lower and also because the monthly installment method of repayment is convenient to her.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":80.96,"image":{"id":893046,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy oil, fowls and pigs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Ntamulung, Bamenda, NW.

He believes that this business will be a success because he is has had this business for a long time. He has a good driver who is his son, and he has enough customers. This business will be of great help to the community in that it will provide transportation services to the people in his locality, making movement easier. It will also ease the transportation of farm produce from the farms to the markets.\n\nHe will use the proceeds from his loan to open a workshop for his daughter, pay school fees for his children and feed and provide medication for his family. He prefers a GHAPE loan because he likes the repayment method, the training he constantly receives and the aspect of group support.\n\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":893101,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle

is 28years old. She is married and has five children, three of these children are younger than fifteen years of age. The major challenge she has faced in her life was the death of her husband and father, which led to a lot of difficulty involving in bringing up her children.\r\n\r\nShe joint GHAPE in 2008 and has successfully received and repaid Empowerment credit two times. She invested her last loans in the business of poultry sales and the sale of drinks. She used the profits to pay for her children\u2019s school fees and also to expand her off-license business.\r\n \r\nGiven a loan, Mbi will indulge in the buying and selling of raw food stuff like maize, beans, palm oil, and also in the sale of drinks. She believes that this business will be a success because she has experience in it. This business will be of great help to the community in that the fowls will increase protein intake of the people in her community, the fowl\u2019s droppings will be a source of manure, which will lead to improved yields.

is 46 years old. She is single and has four children, three of whom are younger than 15 years old. She lives in a 10-bedroom apartment with her children at Ntamulung in Bamenda, Mezam Division in the North West Region of Cameroon. The main challenge she has faced in her life has been the death of her father, sicknesses and the lack of capital to start up a business. \r\n\r\nShe joined GHAPE in 2005 and has since then received and repaid Empowerment Credit four times. She invested her past loans in farming, neathing and in the retail of some Tianshi products. She used the profit from these activities to buy books, pay school fees and to feed and clothe her family. Given a loan, she will invest in the retail of Tianshi food supplements, in farming and to buy and sell raw foodstuffs. She believes that this business will be a success because her prices are moderate and she already has a good number of customers. This business activity will be of help to the community in that it will reduce the distance they would have traveled to the market to get foodstuff.

She invested this loan in the sale of wood and the making of traditional dresses. She used the profits to feed, cloth and provide medication for her children.\r\n\r\nGiven a loan, she intends to buy and retail maize and also invest in her dress-making business. She believes that this business will succeed because it is well located and she has a good knowledge of this business. This business activity will be of great help to the community: her products will be  accessible to locals thereby saving the time it would have taken to buy them from the market. \r\n\r\nWith the profit from her loan, she will open an account in the credit union where she will save some money. She will take care of her family and and also support her extended relatives. She prefers a GHAPE loan because the method of repayment is easier and because of the training that GHAPE gives its members. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":56.31,"image":{"id":893199,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","use":"to buy maize, thread and fabric","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Mile-Two, Bamenda, NW.

Fernando has his own home and has been farming since he was a child.  He has four parcels of farmland, but only three are productive, where he raises achiote, yucca, and citrus with help from his wife and children.  \u201cThe business is profitable when planting is done in quantity,\u201d he says.  \u201cI had planted tangelos (a juicy variety of citrus), but a blight destroyed my crop.  We lost a big investment,\u201d he added as he explained that the climate and blights had caused this problem.  Working with his communal bank, because of the trust and confidence they have, has opened the door for him to be able to continue growing as a farmer.  This will be Fernando\u2019s first time seeking a loan through MFP.  He will use the money from this loan to buy seed.  With great faith he will take a chance growing pineapples. He will also hire field hands to clear his achiote fields."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":893290,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy seed and hire field hands","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-10-12T19:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fernando ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2011-10-14T17:45:25Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}}]}
