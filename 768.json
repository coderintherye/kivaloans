Concurrently, he will offer a better variety of products to his customers so will sell more and obtain better income.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 hopes to have a larger store because there are more than 800 inhabitants in his community and they have to travel up to 12 kilometers to buy whatever they don\u2019t find in his store so he sees quite a large market available in his community and this is why he requests the loan to stock up on everything needed.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":123.41,"image":{"id":956303,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy 15 tanks of propane per week, beans and rice by the quintal, soap by the case and milk.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"San Miguel","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2012-01-02T19:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-01T19:30:08Z","loan_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jos\u00e9 Fredys","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":45.47},{"due_date":"2012-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":45.78},{"due_date":"2012-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":48.26},{"due_date":"2012-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":48.02},{"due_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":49.78},{"due_date":"2012-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":50.34},{"due_date":"2012-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":52.09},{"due_date":"2012-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":52.78},{"due_date":"2012-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":54.03},{"due_date":"2012-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":56.17},{"due_date":"2012-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":56.27},{"due_date":"2012-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":59.38},{"due_date":"2013-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":60.79},{"due_date":"2013-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":62.84},{"due_date":"2013-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":63.88},{"due_date":"2013-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":65.25},{"due_date":"2013-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":70.54}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.47},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.78},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.26},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.02},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.78},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.34},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.09},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.78},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.03},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.17},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.27},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.38},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.79},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.84},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.88},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.25},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.54}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":45.66,"local_amount":45.66,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:16:22Z","rounded_local_amount":45.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257182502,"comment":null},{"amount":77.75,"local_amount":77.75,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:28:58Z","rounded_local_amount":77.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263317543,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-25T15:41:49Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":366347,"name":"Ibrahim","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ibrahim, a 27-year-old Lebanese single man, lives with his parents and one sibling.

Ica is a warm and affectionate city that is well known as the Land of the Eternal Sun because of its warm climate in any season of the year, with its majestic dunes and its very well-known Huacachina Lagoon.  The residents are very warm and welcoming, as well as being fighters, because in spite of the 2007 earthquake they have not let themselves be defeated by adversity and they are moving forward.\r\n\r\nWilfredo is one of them.  He is a real fighter and above all he loves his work.  He lives with his partner with whom he has three children, ages 18, 15, and 3.  The oldest, the 18-year-old, is studying in the university.  His 15-year-old child is in the fourth year of high school and the youngest of all is not yet in school but is inquisitive and above all very affectionate.  His partner helps him a lot in everything he does in spite of being a surgeon in a health center.  Both of them work very hard to get ahead, for their children above all, because the only legacy they can leave them is their studies.  He mentioned to us that he would have liked to be a civil engineer.  In his spare time Wilfredo enjoys reading some books he has at home, and his favorite dishes are ceviche and \"tallarines rojos\" [\"red spaghetti,\" with a Peruvian-style red sauce].\r\n\r\nCurrently Wilfredo works transporting passengers, as a taxi driver, that is.  He works about eight hours a day.  In one day he can earn up to 45 PEN, and 65 PEN in a very good day.  Wilfredo works very hard at his job.  He believes that it is going well for him in his business because there are many customers who need transportation and above all because he is very honest and responsible in his work.  He tells us that when he drives he watches out for not only his own safety but also that of his passengers because they both have families, and driving cautiously is the key to avoiding traffic accidents.\r\n\r\nWilfredo is more than grateful to the Kiva lenders because with the money given he will be able to fix the motor of his car and give it general maintenance.  With this improvement he will have a car in good condition so his customers travel more safely and the car is in good shape.  This will generate better income to be able to continue saving and so achieve one of his biggest dreams, to buy a new car.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":75.88,"image":{"id":973330,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","use":"to repair the motor of his car.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ica","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2012-01-04T22:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-03T22:50:05Z","loan_amount":1125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Wilfredo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":202.34},{"due_date":"2012-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":216.44},{"due_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":217.64},{"due_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":228.45},{"due_date":"2012-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":233.97},{"due_date":"2012-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":244.83},{"due_date":"2012-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":251.51},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":260.72},{"due_date":"2012-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":271.63},{"due_date":"2012-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":280.22},{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":291.18},{"due_date":"2013-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":301.07}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.88},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.16},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.62},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.74},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.81},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.31},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.77},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101.86},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.09},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.19},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.9}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":75.88,"local_amount":202.34,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:56:41Z","rounded_local_amount":204.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263271167,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-31T23:36:19Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":367385,"name":"Robinson","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Robinson compr\u00f3 calzado deportivo, juguetes en general y v\u00edveres, con su anterior credikiva y todo lo vendi\u00f3.

At the same time this loan will allow Wilfredo to think of the future and of being able to buy himself his own truck to transport all his vegetables.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":149.1,"image":{"id":938034,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"to buy more vegetables to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ica","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2011-12-12T18:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-10T18:30:04Z","loan_amount":1125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Wilfredo Antonio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":186.47},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":211.13},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225.11},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":227.11},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":238.01},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":244.14},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":255.09},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.42},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":272.03},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":283.04},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":292.35},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":303.1}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.93},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.42},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.16},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.26},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.55},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.66},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.41},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.01},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.14},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.63},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":113.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":69.93,"local_amount":186.47,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:45:49Z","rounded_local_amount":188.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257142492,"comment":null},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":211.13,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:58:04Z","rounded_local_amount":213.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263271083,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-27T02:06:01Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":378789,"name":"Lino","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Lino, es un hombre trabajador y luchador que constantemente est\u00e1 asumiendo retos para poder salir adelante y ayudar a sus hijos que a\u00fan necesitan de \u00e9l. \u00c9l se\u00f1or Lino, es soltero y se dedicaal cuidado de sus hijos y a su trabajo, actualmente esta peque\u00f1a y humilde familia viven en la ciudad de Caman\u00e1, ubicada al sur del pa\u00eds y caracterizada por los deliciosos platos marinos que brinda, como prueba de ello el se\u00f1or Lino considera que el \u201cChupe de Camarones\u201d es el mejor de todos y por ello lo ha elegido como su plato de comida favorita.\n\nLino no pudo terminar el colegio, pero sab\u00eda que esto no lo iba a detener y lo iba  estancar, como todo joven luchador que era empez\u00f3 a incursionar en distintos tipos de negocio, hasta que en un momento llego a comprarse una moto taxi y desde esa fecha labora 12 horas al d\u00eda y atiende a 50 clientes, este desempe\u00f1o y dedicaci\u00f3n tienen sus resultados al final el d\u00eda porque puede ganar hasta S\/.70 en un buen d\u00eda, estos ingresos y esta lucha constante le han permitido matricular a sus hijos en centros superiores para que ambos pueda desarrollarse profesionalmente, \u00e9l desea que ellos sean unos muy buenos profesionales, siempre honrados y apasionados por que hacen.\n\n\u00c9l sue\u00f1a con poder comprarse otra moto taxi y hacer algunas reparaciones en su vivienda, que sus hijos contin\u00faen acudiendo a sus estudios, pero para esto necesita poder comprarse otra moto taxi, el se\u00f1or Lino considera una meta llegar a comprarsela en 6 meses y generar much\u00edsimos m\u00e1s ingresos, pero para poder llegar a compr\u00e1rsela necesita ahorrar y darle duro a su trabajo, \u00e9l ha tenido la idea de darle mantenimiento a su moto taxi y as\u00ed poder asegurar su herramienta de trabajo y lograr los ingresos que necesita para poder lograr su GRAN SUE\u00d1O. \n","en":"Lino is a hardworking and determined man. He is constantly taking on challenges in order to get ahead and help his children who still depend on him. Lino is single and dedicates himself to caring for his children and to his work. At present this small, humble family lives in the city of Caman\u00e1, which is located in the south of the country; Caman\u00e1 is known for delicious seafood dishes. As proof of that, Lino considers shrimp chowder the best dish of all, and therefore chose it as his favorite food. \r\n\r\nLino wasn't able to finish high school, but knew that that wasn't going to hold him back. Like the determined youth he was, he began to make excursions into different types of business until the moment when he bought a moto taxi. Since then he has worked twelve hours a day and attends to 50 customers. His performance and dedication show results at the end of the day, as he can earn up to S\/.70 on a good day. This income and his constant effort have allowed Lino to enroll his children in superior schools, so that both can develop themselves professionally. He hopes that they will be very good professionals, honorable and passionate for what they do. \r\n\r\nLino's dream is to be able to buy another moto taxi and to make some repairs to his home, so that his children can continue with their studies. But to do this he needs to buy another moto taxi. Lino's goal is to buy it in six months and generate substantially more income, but in order to be able to buy it he needs to save and work hard. He has had the idea of making some repairs to his moto taxi and this way can secure his 'tool of the trade' and earn the income necessary for his great dream. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":75.88,"image":{"id":977562,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","use":"to maintain his moto taxi.

He lives in Ica, a city currently characterized by the level of investment, not only in agricultural exports, also known as large farms, but also in the opening of new shopping centers that offer lots of jobs to the residents of Ica.  In his free time Jorge enjoys playing soccer with his friends very much.\n\nJorge Luis is married.  His wife has been working for some time as a maid in a home to be able to help with the household expenses.  Together they have three children.  One of their children is 3 years old and is in the first year of school.  The second one is 9 and is in elementary school, and the oldest is 14 and has been in high school for a couple of years.\n\nJorge Luis has been a taxi driver since he was very young.  He also has a school transportation service and gives personal transportation to some customers who want to travel to nearby farms.  He works approximately 10 hours a day.  His friends are the ones who were enthusiastic about him working in this type of business.  In one day Jorge Luis can transport 45 customers to different parts of the city, and this allows him to earn approximately an average of 50 PEN daily, and in a good day he can earn up to 60 PEN, which helps with some additional household expenses.  His business is successful because in the last few years the population of Ica has been increasing and so many more people need transportation.\n\nCurrently he wants the Kiva lenders to be able to help him so he can give money from the loan to his mother and his sister, so they both can start their business selling shoes.\n\nThis loan will be able to give him the opportunity to help his family.  In time and with the profits that his mother and sister earn, they will be able to allow themselves to have a better quality of life.  One of Jorge's dreams is to be able to get enough money together in a few months to be able to buy himself his own car.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":79.05,"image":{"id":941526,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to help his mother and his sister.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ica","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2011-12-12T18:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-10T18:30:06Z","loan_amount":575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jorge Luis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":101.27},{"due_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":104.95},{"due_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":111.9},{"due_date":"2012-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":112.89},{"due_date":"2012-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":118.31},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":121.36},{"due_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":126.8},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":130.45},{"due_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":135.22},{"due_date":"2012-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":140.7},{"due_date":"2012-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":145.32},{"due_date":"2012-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":150.83}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.82},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.23},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.9},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.27},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.35},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.52},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.61},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.01},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.83},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.94},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.7},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.82}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":79.05,"local_amount":206.22,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:58:17Z","rounded_local_amount":213.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263271090,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-31T14:01:35Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":369621,"name":"Kassem","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kassem is 31 years old.

year-old young man, who has a higher education degree in construction engineering and works in his field.  He sells painting and decorating materials at the central market.  He has a wide selection of merchandise that is in high demand.  He sells at a leased store by himself and develops his business.  Bakhtiyor started his business by putting together a team of workers, specializing in construction and decoration work, and worked on houses, apartments and offices repair orders.  He earned a living through this work and provided for his family for several years.  Because he had regular clients, who purchased paint and materials, he decided to open an additional business of selling construction materials.  Bakhtiyor combined both businesses since he could sell his merchandise for his own orders to repair apartments and houses, making it more profitable for him.  When he opened his construction materials store, he obtained a small loan from a bank and started his business.  Business was going well, and Bakhtiyor increased his goods turnover.  He worked a lot with lending organizations and never violated procedures.  Prior to the inflation, he obtained financing in international currency, but got burned.  So, since the inflation in December of 2009, he tried to obtain a loan in the national currency and came to us.  According to the client's words, our loan was very timely for him and helped him a lot in improving his family affairs.  Bakhtiyor plans to use this loan to purchase a wholesale inventory of sealants and paint at a low price."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":348.2,"image":{"id":979047,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase sealants and paint wholesale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Khujand","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.28 69.631667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2012-01-11T20:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-10T20:50:07Z","loan_amount":3000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bakhtiyor","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":3000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":172.3},{"due_date":"2012-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":175.9},{"due_date":"2012-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":179.58},{"due_date":"2012-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":183.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":187.16},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":191.07},{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":195.07},{"due_date":"2012-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":199.14},{"due_date":"2012-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":203.31},{"due_date":"2012-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":207.56},{"due_date":"2012-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":211.89},{"due_date":"2012-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":216.32},{"due_date":"2013-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":220.84},{"due_date":"2013-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":225.46},{"due_date":"2013-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":231.07}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":172.3},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175.9},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.58},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":183.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":187.16},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":191.07},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.07},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":199.14},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":203.31},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":207.56},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":211.89},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":216.32},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":220.84},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225.46},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":231.07}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":348.2,"local_amount":348.2,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:27:05Z","rounded_local_amount":348.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263381622,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-01T18:51:23Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":369661,"name":"Imad","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Imad is a 38-year-old Lebanese single man living with his parents.

He lives in Ak-Bulak, a village in the south of Kyrgyzstan. He has five kids, and his wife is a homemaker. Since 1991, Abdalym\u2019s family has been successfully engaged in growing crops and livestock breeding. Today, the Abdalym\u2019s farm has cows and calves, and enough corn, hay and oil cake for their feed. After cultivating 0.25 hectares of land, Abdalym\u2019s family collected 2.5 tons of potatoes, which they will use during the winter. The income from such business allowed Abdalym to buy a car for his family. \r\n\r\nAbdalym applied for a loan of 100.000 som (KGS) from Bai-Tushum & Partners to purchase more cattle. In the very near future, Abdalym is planning to arrange for his son\u2019s marriage.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":939283,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Ak-Bulak village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2011-12-13T21:50:25Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-11T21:50:25Z","loan_amount":2150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abdalym","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"loan_amount":2150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":268.75},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":268.75},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":268.75},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":268.75},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":268.75},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":268.75},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":268.75},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":268.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-01-27T09:03:20Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":370103,"name":"Ali","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ali is a 33-year-old married man living with his wife.

In addition, one of his favorite dishes is \u201csaltado de carne\u201d (stir-fry beef spaghetti). He tells us he would eat it every day if he could.

Para poder salir adelante el y su esposa trabajan arduamente todos los d\u00edas, su esposa es una mujer que se dedica a la venta de men\u00fas, cervezas y salchipollos, esta ganancias les permiten recaudar el dinero necesario para los gastos del hogar.\n\nPedro, como todo hombre de familia responsable, se dedica a la venta diaria de Raspadillas  desde las 9 de la ma\u00f1ana hasta las 5 de la tarde, este duro laborar le permite ganar en promedio S\/.80 diarios y si es un muy buen d\u00eda, que es lo que Pedro desea a diario, \u00e9l puede ganar hasta S\/.180, normalmente atiende entre 60 y 130 clientes. El sabe que su negocio tiene \u00e9xito porque los jarabes que usa para la preparaci\u00f3n de sus raspadillas est\u00e1n a base de pura fruta y atiende muy bien a sus clientes.  Pedro tiene que aprovechar esta temporada tan calurosa en la ciudad de Mala, porque solo es en estos 3 primeros meses del a\u00f1o donde su producto va ser muy solicitado.  Su analista nos coment\u00f3 que el se\u00f1or Pedro fue ubicado en una plaza de Coayllo, ubicada en la ciudad de Mala, y ha debido de esperar para poder realizar la entrevista debido a que tiene mucha afluencia de clientes, incluso hay combis y autos de donde la gente se baja especialmente para comprar su producto y luego retornar al autom\u00f3vil donde se encontraban.\n\nEsta familia est\u00e1 en constante apego y apoyo familiar, es por esto que Pedro tambi\u00e9n ha incursionado en dedicarse a la alba\u00f1iler\u00eda, solo cuando tiene contratos de construcci\u00f3n, y es as\u00ed como genera ingresos los meses restantes del a\u00f1o para su familia.

He\u2019s married and he and his wife have three little children who are 5, 8 and 12 years old, all attending school although they are currently on vacation.  In order to get ahead, he and his wife work hard every day.  His wife\u2019s a woman who sells daily meals, beer and \u2018salchipollos\u2019 [traditional fast food snack consisting of fried potatoes with fried chicken and condiments].  Profits allow them to earn money needed for household expenses.\r\n\r\nPedro, like all responsible family men, works every day.  He sells \u2018raspadillas\u2019 [shaved ice topped with flavored syrup] from 9 in the morning until 5 in the afternoon.  This hard work enables him to earn on average 80 soles a day and if he has a very good day, which is what Pedro wishes for every day, he can earn up to 180 soles.  He normally tends to between 60 and 130 customers.  He knows that his business is successful because the syrups he uses to make the shaved ice are based on pure fruit and because he provides very good customer service.  Pedro must take advantage of the hot season in the city of Mala because during the first three months of the year his product is highly sought-after.  His loan adviser commented to us that Pedro was situated in one of Coayllo\u2019s squares located in the city of Mala and his interview had to be postponed because of the large affluence of customers he has.  Besides, there are buses and autos that the people get off of precisely to buy his product and then climb in again.\r\n\r\nThis family constantly support and love each other and this is why Pedro has also gone into bricklaying but only when he gets construction contracts.  This is how he generates additional income for the family during the other months of the year.\r\n\r\nThanks to support from Kiva lenders he will be able to buy a linear motorcycle that he can use to transport his shave ice maker from place to place and go to nearby zones to sell when they have their festivals or other types of activities.  His goal is to generate the necessary income to educate his three little ones and to supply his business with new tables and chairs.  But his greatest dream is to be able to enlarge his house and install his wife\u2019s restaurant in the front part of it.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":74.49,"image":{"id":978550,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","use":"to buy a motorcycle to move his shaved ice maker from place to place.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Mala","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2012-01-13T20:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-12T20:10:06Z","loan_amount":1125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pedro Vicente","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":198.63},{"due_date":"2012-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":213.79},{"due_date":"2012-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":214.98},{"due_date":"2012-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":226.61},{"due_date":"2012-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":232.52},{"due_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":244.25},{"due_date":"2012-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":251.45},{"due_date":"2012-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":261.44},{"due_date":"2012-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":273.34},{"due_date":"2012-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":282.68},{"due_date":"2012-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":294.7},{"due_date":"2013-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":305.61}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.49},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.17},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.62},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.97},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.2},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.59},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.3},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.04},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.52},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":114.6}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":74.49,"local_amount":198.63,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:57:31Z","rounded_local_amount":200.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263271196,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-01T20:49:46Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":370567,"name":"Ahmad","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ahmad is 31 years old, married, and has one child who attends school.

He lives in Ica, Peru.  Ica is located in the Sechura Desert, almost four hours south of Lima, the country's capital, and it is renowned by Peruvians as the \"Land of the Sun.\"  It is known in Peru for its frequent earthquakes (one 8.0 in 2007 and one 6.9 in 2011), its grape, asparagus, and olive production, and perhaps above all as the source of Peru's traditional national drink, pisco.  This customer's home and business can be found in this hot, dry climate. It is common knowledge that Peru has some of the most delicious food in the world and one of his favorite dishes is arroz chaufa.  Gustavo only went to school up until the fifth grade because of his parents' limited financial resources, but he would have liked to have studied civic engineering.\r\n\r\nGustavo lives with his partner, who sells salchipapas.  They have two children together, the eldest of whom is in the fifth grade, with the youngest in the first grade.\r\n\t\r\nGustavo molds and fires bricks for a living.  He does this work five hours a day and he is able to serve one customer per day.  Because this work is very hard and demanding, he is able to earn 60 nuevos soles a day and on a good day he can earn up to 80, which helps him with extra household expenses and which allows him to invest in his business.  He believes that his business is going well because there is always a clientele for this kind of work.  He also works helping his partner sell mototaxis and this is going well for them because of the way his partner seasons her dishes.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, he is very thankful to Kiva's borrowers because with this help he will be able to help his partner do some maintenance work on her sandwich cart and with this improvement she will have more supplies with which to make her salchipapas and hamburgers.  This will also increase her earnings, which will improve their quality of life and allow them to continue to save, which will help them achieve their greatest dream: offering their children a profession.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":75.88,"image":{"id":978653,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to perform maintenance on a sandwich cart\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ica","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2012-01-14T02:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-13T02:50:05Z","loan_amount":1125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gustavo Cesar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":202.34},{"due_date":"2012-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":216.44},{"due_date":"2012-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":217.64},{"due_date":"2012-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":228.45},{"due_date":"2012-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":233.97},{"due_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":244.83},{"due_date":"2012-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":251.51},{"due_date":"2012-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":260.72},{"due_date":"2012-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":271.63},{"due_date":"2012-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":280.22},{"due_date":"2012-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":291.18},{"due_date":"2013-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":301.07}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.88},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.16},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.62},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.74},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.81},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.31},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.77},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101.86},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.09},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.19},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.9}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":75.88,"local_amount":202.34,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:58:01Z","rounded_local_amount":204.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263271198,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-04T06:09:21Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":370153,"name":"Armen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Armen is 39 years-old and he lives in Ijevan city.

Karimjon has been taking care of livestock (only cattle) for over 15 years.  He keeps it for 6-8 months and sells it at a livestock market.  Karimjon and his brothers also have a butcher shop, where they can sell their livestock.  Over the period of obtaining financing from our organization since 2009, this is his yet another loan to be used for the purchase of livestock and growth of livestock headcount.  He has good conditions for keeping livestock.  Karimjon knows animal husbandry very well and can also cure the herd himself during livestock illness.

children.  His wife is not employed and takes care of the household.  Rahim comes to his place of work every morning at the largest city market, Panshanbe, in the city center.  Here, he is involved in selling fruits and vegetables.  His selection includes bananas, apples, pears and tropical fruits, and out of vegetables - tomatoes and cucumbers.  Local farmers and dekhan farmers, who deliver fruits and vegetables to him, supply him with the products in the spring.  He travels to the neighboring Uzbekistan himself in the winter, and also buys products from local farmers, who grow fruits and vegetables in greenhouses.  Rahim's oldest son (shown on the photograph) helps him with running the business and also when Rahim leaves to buy products.  Besides this, his son is an auto-mechanic and is involved in car repairs.

Ica is renowned as one of the main city for investments thanks to the new commercial centers found in different parts of the country.  These large companies have given many more people job opportunities and that has also benefited the outside owners of the big commercial centers.  This is shown by Manuel, who, thanks to the increase in affluence and the great necessity of transportation, has been able to make a higher income with his effort and dedication.\r\n\r\nManuel is married, and his wife is a worker.  Every day their 2 children go to school to continue increasing their knowledge.  The youngest is 8 and the oldest is 15. Manuel would have liked to have been a physical education teacher, and he studied for this profession for some months, but because of the  lack of money, he chose to work the most hours possible to earn more.  He works as a driver of a motor taxi 15 hours every day, seeing approximately 85 to 90 customers.  This lets him earn on average 80 sols daily and if it\u2019s a good day, he makes about 90 sols.  In Ica the cost of a ride on this type of transport is on average 1 sol per trip whenever the distances are short.\r\n\r\nManuel thinks that his business is successful becaue he put a lot of enthusiasm into his work.
