She is divorced and lives with her two children, 12 year old Cristian and 10 year old Luz Clara.  She is a very industrious woman who has always worked since she had to leave her studies in highschool to work.  Olga works from 8 in the morning until 6 in the afternoon selling CDs, movies, cartoons, documentaries, etc, which clients buy very frequently.  The only bad thing about her work is having to fight for the locations where she goes to make her sales (she is a traveling saleswoman), since the competition does not want to be too close together.  But aside from this small inconvenience she likes her work, since it distracts her and at the same time she earns money to cover her family's costs.  Olga wants her children to not be uncomfortable because of their finances.  It is because of this that she sacrifices to give them the best.  With the money from the loan she will purchase more CDs to earn more income and in the future have a fixed location to sell her merchandise.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Megan Tatman Montgomery, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":220454,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Movie Tapes & DVDs","sector":"Retail","use":"To increase the quantity of discs that she sells, and save to have a location of her own for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-11-13T02:10:22Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Olga","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-27T15:33:46Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2008-12-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T01:29:15Z","rounded_local_amount":204.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9957574,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-01-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:12:29Z","rounded_local_amount":204.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10227830,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:09:15Z","rounded_local_amount":204.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20423059,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-03-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:42:03Z","rounded_local_amount":204.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116295,"comment":null},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-04-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:52:10Z","rounded_local_amount":204.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011247,"comment":null},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:57:24Z","rounded_local_amount":204.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44594850,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-11-13T15:33:46Z","paid_date":"2009-06-16T00:57:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":72642,"name":"Aurelia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Aurelia es natural de Ocuviri, est\u00e1 divorciada de su pareja y vive con sus hijos Rolando de 25, William de 22, Mary Luz de 20 y Beatriz de 15 a\u00f1os.

Yauli has a warm climate. The most popular occupation is commerce because there is an abundance of potatoes, onions, wheat, and livestock, including cows, goats, and sheep, although in smaller numbers. The community also produces milk and cheese, and its beautiful sights attract tourists. Along the streets of Yauli you can see the Chopccas, the native people of the region who dress in colorful garments. In Yauli there is place near the train station where the members of Finca Peru sell their delicious potato and cheese dishes to the passengers.<p>\r\n\r\nPaulina C. is married and has two children, 23 and 30 years old, who are both married. Paulina started selling lollipops, earning nine soles for every box she sold. She heard about Finca Peru in the train station, and she decided to take part in their meetings. Her loans have allowed her to rent a store downtown in Yauli and purchase pots and pans, dishes, and clothing to stock the store. Paulina told us that business is going very well. With Finca Peru she learned to overcome problems in managing a store and thanks to the training given to members, she considers Finca Peru as a parent giving her a loan to start a new business. She learned how to save money and to set up a working capital fund. Paulina's dream is to have a larger store and to purchase more merchandise to better serve her clients.\r\n<p>\r\nMarceL. T. is married and has 4 children. She sells meats. MarceL. has a daughter who is mentally disabled and wanders the streets. This worries MarceL. very much but her friends at Finca Peru remind her that with the help of God she will get better. With her loans MarceL. rented a store in downtown Yauli and purchased more merchandise. She sells ice cream, soft drinks, and beer. Her dream is to purchase a house in downtown Yauli. It is very expensive but she is saving to make her dream a reality.\r\n<p>\r\nDoris B. is married and has 2 children, 2 and 4 years old. She tells us that her husband has abandoned her and during that period she suffered a great deal. She is the only one supporting her daughters. She has a convenience store where she previously sold only groceries, but little by little she was able to improve the selection. Now she sells meats, vegetables, fruits, clothing etc. In Yuali there are many weddings and baptisms and she wants to purchase merchandise for these special occasions. She has learned to appreciate herself as a woman and never allow herself to be mistreated. She is grateful to Finca Peru because she learned how to save money, to be strong, and have strong values. Doris\u2019 dream is to proviD. her daughters with an education, until they grow up to be professionals. She also dreams of opening a snack bar, because there isn't one in Yauli.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by a Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\r\nEl bancomunal Nuevo Amanecer esta ubicado en el departamento D.

Firstly, they require little start-up capital. You can start with one or two, and either add to them as you go, or wait for them to multiply naturally! Secondly, they require little space, so sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. Thirdly, while they are growing, they produce eggs, which can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income, or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein.<p>\r\nShe works at the business 16+ hours a day, 7 days a week, with the help of her children when they are home from school.

His auto shop is located in a zone where competition is fierce: at the 66th kilometer mark on route 2, in the city of Eusebio Ayala. He began his career by taking classes at the town's trade institute and later by working hands-on with his father at the shop they owned in the city of Caacup\u00e9. For ten years he worked there, and he only left when he felt he had obtained the experience necessary to do his job comfortably. Currently, Mr. Patrocionio owns a home-based auto shop that is equipped with modern tools, which were purchased with loans he received from Fundacion Paraguaya. It was hard in the beginning because customers wanted to become familiar with the quality of his work, but thanks to clients', neighbors' and friends' recommendations, now he has a solid clientele. He says that his main accomplishment has been taking risks to achieve his professional independence. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Bertolt Cantalice, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":220742,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Auto Repair","sector":"Services","use":"Purchase lubricants, parts and other accessories.

Searching for a little more support to boost their family incomes by way of credit and improve their quality of life, they decided to form a committee. Their numbers grew thanks to this program. They need this credit transaction to invest in their respective micro-businesses and achieve a sustainable growth that makes them grow as a group and as individuals. The women that form this committee are all artisan weavers. The city of Carapegu\u00e1 is the birthplace of the artisan weaves of our country. Among the most popular weaves that these women make are the Paraguay hammocks known worldwide. All their weaves, including the thread that they use, are made totally by hand. In this city, ninety percent of the population is dedicated to this activity and sells these products to other cities and exports them. These women have come to sell their products in great quantities and they have a large portfolio of clients, who week to week request various varieties of the products they weave. This is why, to meet the great demand, they are requesting a loan that they will invest in purchasing hammocks, bed spreads, table cloths, and other things made by other artisans, as well as purchasing materials like cotton yarn to continue weaving.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jay Osborne, Kiva

Before joining the TYM fund, her family was very poor. Since 1998, her family\u2019s financial situation has been improved. She was able to afford more living facilities and bought a motorcycle, now used as the family\u2019s main transportation mean.

Thi Nguyen is 62 years old.  She has been participating in the Fund for over 10 years.  In all the time in which she has borrowed from the Fund to do business, Mrs. Nguyen has always made repayments according to the loan terms and has abided by all other terms and conditions.  Currently, besides income from the livestock business, she also receives a monthly pension and financial support from her adult son who has a stable job.  Therefore, the family's quality of life is improving day by day.  In this round of funding, she would like to borrow 15,000,000 VND to invest in buying more chickens and feed.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by Chi Nguyen, Kiva

She has 5 children, who are all grown adults.  In 2002, Mrs. V. joined the Fund to have more capital to invest in raising livestock to improve the family's finances.  Currently, besides the income from the livestock and tree farming businesses, the family also has income streams from her husband's security job and her children's salaries.  The family's finances are becoming more and more stable with time.  With a total income of 2,500,000 VND per month, Mrs. V.'s repayments are proceeding very favorably.  In this round of funding she would like to borrow 10,000,000 VND to invest in buying more pigs to raise.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by Chi Nguyen, Kiva

They were able to use the proceeds to pay for their children's school fees in case things were difficult for their husbands.

Prices for the inks vary depending on the color, ranging from Le 40,000 to Le 60,000. She sells the gara clothes (gara lapper) between Le 25,000 and Le 30,000.

They have received previous loans from Kiva through SMT that were of great help to these entrepreneurs. The last loan was for Le 800,000 each. They repaid it successfully and are now requesting a new loan for Le 1,000,000 each.\r\n\r\nFatmata (pictured in the middle) is the leader of this group. She was born in Fadugu, about twenty-five miles from Kabala. She is forty and married with five children. Four of her children are in secondary schools and one is in primary school. She pays for their education with proceeds from the market foods she sells in the market. Her husband is now too old to fend for the family so it is incumbent on her to take care of their children. \r\n\r\nFatmata has been in business for over ten years. She sells market food at the Tender Hill market. With this loan, she will invest in market foods like onions, margi (used in sauce), peppers, salts, oil, sugar, and more. She buys most of these items in Kabala town. When they are scarce in Kabala, she will send to Freetown (about 570 round-trip) where prices for the goods are relatively cheaper. With higher profits, Fatmata will be able to assist her children in their education, feeding, and clothing and provide them with medical care when anyone falls sick."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":221490,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"To purchasing food for resale in the marketplace.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Kabala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"9.583333 -11.55","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2008-11-05T19:00:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatmata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sonny","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bengali","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":3000000,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2009-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2009-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2009-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2009-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2009-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2009-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2009-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2009-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2009-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":250000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":85.42},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":85.41},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85.42},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85.42},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85.41},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.42},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.42},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.41},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.42},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.42},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.41},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":111.04,"local_amount":325000,"processed_date":"2008-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:28:03Z","rounded_local_amount":330626.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5346105,"comment":null},{"amount":316.04,"local_amount":925000,"processed_date":"2009-03-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:44:19Z","rounded_local_amount":941014.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27128876,"comment":null},{"amount":85.41,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2009-04-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:10:58Z","rounded_local_amount":254328.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36025666,"comment":null},{"amount":264.79,"local_amount":775000,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T23:53:57Z","rounded_local_amount":788417.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53008470,"comment":null},{"amount":76.89,"local_amount":225000,"processed_date":"2009-08-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:37:35Z","rounded_local_amount":228895.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73662599,"comment":null},{"amount":85.41,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:16:52Z","rounded_local_amount":254328.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87102834,"comment":null},{"amount":85.42,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2009-10-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:03:07Z","rounded_local_amount":254328.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97019873,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-11-10T15:53:07Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T06:03:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":72864,"name":"Afqan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Afqan K. is 54 years old, married and has four children.

(Five gallons make a batter.) He buys the palm-oil in a village called Yele that is about thirty-five miles from Makeni. He sells the palm-oil in Makeni. The price of a batter is not fixed. It ranges from Le 30,000.00 to 50,000.00 depending on the season and the availability of the palm-oil in the market. \r\n\r\nThe only challenge he is facing in his business is that of transportation. It is sometimes very difficult to get a vehicle to transport the palm-oil to Makeni. His greatest desire now is to be able to make higher profits to be able to meet some of the demands of his children, especially their education fees."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1700,"image":{"id":221492,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase palm oil to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Makeni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.883333 -12.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2008-11-05T19:20:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Patrick A.","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadiatu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary P.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aminata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":5000000,"loan_amount":1700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2008-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2009-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2009-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2009-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2009-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":212.5,"local_amount":625000,"processed_date":"2008-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:28:09Z","rounded_local_amount":632718.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5346106,"comment":null},{"amount":637.5,"local_amount":1875000,"processed_date":"2009-03-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:47:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1898156.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27128877,"comment":null},{"amount":169.99,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2009-04-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:14:32Z","rounded_local_amount":506175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36025667,"comment":null},{"amount":467.5,"local_amount":1375000,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T23:54:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1391981.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53008471,"comment":null},{"amount":42.51,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:23:41Z","rounded_local_amount":126543.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63230820,"comment":null},{"amount":170,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:38:23Z","rounded_local_amount":506175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73662600,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-11-16T16:01:51Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T21:38:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":72866,"name":"Tamaraneh Iii Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p>This is Isatu T. and Kadiatu C..

She was widowed 10 years ago, and from her first husband she has four children \u2014 ages 22, 17, 15 and 12. She tells us her 15-year-old daughter has special needs. She has been remarried for three years with Mr. Odil\u00f3n Villar, who makes a living as a machine operator at a textile factory in the city of San Antonio. She has one son from this marriage. Inocencia says that since she was very young she made a living in commerce, first selling fruits and vegetables grown at her home. She adds that with the help of credit her situation has vastly improved, and it made it possible to build an extra room in her home. It also helped her move to selling clothes, shoes and bazaar items out of her home, allowing her to be around more and be closer to her children.

The loan will give her the opportunity to relaunch her business and increase earnings, therefore providing a greater quality of life for her family. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kris Vickery, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":221665,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"Finance the supplies necessary for a hot dog and French fries stand","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"San Martin de Porres","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.393056 -74.573333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2008-11-18T06:30:24Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Olga","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":600,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":150}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2009-01-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T11:42:02Z","rounded_local_amount":154.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14854227,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:06:44Z","rounded_local_amount":309.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20393112,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T15:23:15Z","rounded_local_amount":154.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35978311,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-11-18T18:27:31Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T15:23:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":72910,"name":"Reina Dayse","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"hola mi nombre es Reina F. me dedico a la produccion y venta de tortillas, tengo varios a\u00f1os de dedicarme a esta actividad, soy una persona trabajadora, honesta y responsable. este negocio es muy bueno ya que la tortilla es un aliemento escencial en nuestro pais, la tortilla se come en los tres tiempos, ademas que es un alimento nutritivo. en estos momentos mi demanda es mucha y no me doy abasto con todo lo que produzco por tal razon estoy solicitando un credito para comprarme un molino electrico y asi poder moler mas maiz para tener mas masa y poder hacer muchas tortillas, esto me ahorra tiempo y esfuerzo ya que en estos momentos muelo el maiz con molino manual.","en":"Hello, my name is Reina F..

With this loan, Magdalene will continue her business of frying and selling gateau (a doughnut like treat), rearing pigs, and raising fowl.  Her business plan involves the purchase two piglets, 8 kilograms of animal feed, flour, sugar, yeast, oil, 50 chicks, and chicken feed.  She also plans to reinforce her fence with part of this loan.  She plans to use 104,000 CFA (approximately $210 USD) of her own savings to supplement her loan and ensure she has the most success in her businesses.  This loan will be repaid over a period of 18 months; the first payment will be made on the day the loan is dispersed.\r\n\r\n<p>This will be Regina's fourth loan from GHAPE; she has been a member since 2004.  She plans to sell her fried gateaux to children on their way to school and to farmers in the morning.  As there are many celebrations in the near future, including Christmas and New Years, chickens will be in high demand soon.  She hopes to raise her chickens to sell before these celebrations, as they only take 6 to 8 weeks to become full grown.  Her husband plans to help her raise her pigs and chickens, as he has a great deal of experience in raising animals.  She plans to support her community by providing them with chickens, pigs, fried gateaux, and manure for sale at reasonable prices.  Moreover, by purchasing her supplies, such as oil and pig feed, from her community, she will help to raise the incomes of others in her community.  With the profits from this loan, Magdalene plans to pay her children's school fees. This is extremely important to her as she was unable to continue her education as a child of poverty.  She also plans to improve her household.  Magdalene hopes that this loan will continue to increase her family's standard of living as those in the past have done.  She is grateful for the business training provided by GHAPE, and knows this training will be crucial in the success of her businesses.\r\n\r\n<p>The Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount to a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instills a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and develops a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.<\/p>

is married with six children and lives in Mbengwi, a rural town outside of Bamenda, Cameroon.  With this loan, she plans to continue her business of rearing pigs and selling cooked food.  Her business plan for the loan involves repairing her pig pen, purchasing piglets, buying pig feed, and continuing to purchase ingredients for her cooked food.  She plans to contribute 55,000 CFA (approximately $110 USD) from her own savings to successfully follow through with her business plan.  \r\n\r\nRegina has been a GHAPE client since 2004; this is her fourth loan.  This loan will help her financial situation by providing her with a long term investment and high profits through her pigs.  Moreover, the sale of cooked food will allow her to cover daily expenses until her pigs are ready to sell.  Many families in this area rear pigs due to their high profit margin and the security they provide as they can be sold in case of any health problems in the family or other emergencies.  The manure from the pigs will be used on Regina's farm as well as sold to those in her community.   \r\n\r\nWith the profits from this loan, Regina plans to ensure that her children's school fees are paid regularly and her children are properly equipped for school.  She also will make sure her family eats well and stays healthy.  However, in case of sickness, she will use some of her profits to ensure her family is treated properly for any illnesses.  Finally, she hopes to place much of her profit into her personal savings account that GHAPE provided for her.

Pauline runs a small \"buy and sell\" stand in Mbengwi.  With this loan, she plans to invest in more products to sell at her stand.  Some of these products include rice, onions, groundnut oil, beans, tomatoes, salt, palm oil, and soya beans.  Her business plan shows she will invest 80,000 CFA (approximately $160 USD) of her own savings as well.\r\n\r\nThis will be Pauline's fourth loan from GHAPE; she has been a member since 2004.  She has been quite successful in the past with her buy-and-sell business due to her location on the main road, the variety of her products, and her reasonable prices.  She goes into Bamenda to purchase most of her products where they are much cheaper and sells them at her stall.  This saves many in her community the transportation costs and the time of going to Bamenda themselves to purchase these items.  She has a strong customer base and is confident that she will be able to increase her sales.  \r\n\r\nThe profits from this loan will be used for the school fees of Pauline's children.  One of her sons recently failed his exams and is required to redo the year, and she must pay an extra year of schooling for this child.  She also plans to purchase household items such as pots, knives, and dishes for her home.

is a 48 year old mother of two from Khujand. She requests a personal loan to make repairs to her kitchen and purchase new furniture. The money will be used to install new gas lines to her kitchen, which is crucial during the winter months when electricity is available only during specific hours of the day. With gas lines she is able to use 'balloon' gas - or canisters which can be stored for use when gas is not available from the city supply. Because of last year's winter conditions, much of Bashorat's furniture was damaged.  During periods where there was no heat in the home, the furniture became very cold.  When the heat returned, condensation formed and has warped her wooden table, chairs and other furniture.  She will use a portion of proceeds for the purchase of new furniture.\r\n\r\nBashorat plans to repay the loan over the next 12 months from her salary earned as a notary. She and her husband have a grown daughter who is married and also a son who is currently studying at the University in Khujand.

He is an ice cream seller. His wife, Mrs. Ton Na, is a farmer and she owns a small plot of land where she cultivates rice to earn an income. Even though they have different careers, they do not make enough money to support their living conditions.

He plans to invest this loan in rearing pigs, fishing, and a feed store.  He has used his past loans to support his pig business and fish farm.  He plans to invest most of this loan in the opening of a feed store.  He will reinforce his pig pen, purchase more fish species and ponds, and set up a food store with the money from this loan.  He plans to contribute 200,000 CFA ($400 USD) of his own savings to ensure the success of this loan.\r\n\r\n<p>This will be Peter's fourth loan from GHAPE; he has been a member since 2004.  He has found that there is an increasing demand for both fish and pigs; this loan will help him to meet the demands of those in his community.  He has found that in his community, there are not many 'serious' pig farmers; this makes his pigs in higher demand than those of other farmers.  The introduction of a new fish species will increase demand for fish and encourage others to take up fish farming.\r\n\r\n<p>With the profits from this loan, Peter plans to expand his business and increase the living standard of his family.  He hopes to advance his children's education by paying for their school fees and other expenses.  He also intends to complete his house and install electricity.\r\n\r\n<p>The Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.

Madeline must get up early to allow her enough time to prepare the family\u2019s meals and afterwards take the cows to graze or otherwise, go in search of pasture for them. Later, she must take her husband\u2019s lunch to him out in the fields and help him cultivate the land to produce potatoes and peas, a livelihood they have continued since they married. Madeline prefers to grow peas rather than potatoes because they require less investment in terms of both money and labour time.

In this area, you can find an abundance of pine trees, eucalyptus trees and quinua plants.  The region identifies itself with the stone frog, <em>qampato<\/em>, and its myths and stories.  Since its foundation, the area has been very welcoming, despite being a small town.  The main activity of the town is cattle farming.  Here, you can find cows, horses and sheep living in open spaces suitable for the breeding of such animals.  Farmers plant crops in tracts and grow a natural form of a native potato species.  Women involved in businesses knit and weave socks, <em>chullos<\/em> (a type of hat), caps, shawls, etc.\r\n<p>\r\nIsidora Q. is married and has 8 children.  She is a weaver and buys and sells cloth.  The most difficult challenge she has faced is when her land was taken over.  The people who took her land threw rocks at her and she was hit many times and became sick.  Her life changed.  With FINCA Peru, she learned solidarity, to become a saver and be punctual in her payments.  She is grateful to FINCA because they lent her 400 nuevos soles without difficulty and trusted her.  For this reason, they elected her to be President of the village bank.  She purchases merchandise and brings it to other places to barter, exchanging meat for cloth.  Isidora's dream is to have enough food to eat everyday and have more livestock, mostly cows and sheep.\r\n<p>\r\nSabina B. is married with three children who are 3 months, 6 years old and 12 years old.  She has a business, working as a weaver of alpaca wool.  Sabina makes caps, shawls and socks.  Now she buys more wool for the orders she receives from small businesses in her town.  In the village bank, she feels like she is with family.  She likes the bank because they concern themselves about how she is doing.  She follows the rules closely, has learned how to save and has many friends.  Her dream is to have her own store, full of merchandise.\r\n<p>\r\nSonia C. is married and has 3 children who are 5, 9 and 12 years old.  She crochets and knits, making pompom decorations for belts and skirts.  She has learned how to save and be a participatory leader.  She loves the bank very much.
