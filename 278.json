W.. James is 42 years old and married. His 6 children are 2-9 years old. The range of grades they are enrolled in is from nursery school to third grade. James also cares for 4 siblings.\r\n\r\nJames is a 10th grade drop-out due to lack of support. He lives in the West Point community in southern downtown Monrovia, Liberia. West Point is a community that is very crowded and is also filled with people who can\u2019t afford a daily meal.\r\n\r\nJames\u2019s business is selling dry goods like rice, farina, dishes, sugar, and the like. He started this business over 5 years ago with his retirement funds. In Liberia, retirement funds are like a peanut, because they can\u2019t take care of a whole family for 2 months, so James decided to use it to open a small-to-medium business. Today, his business feeds his family.\r\n\r\nBecause James lives in a community that is home to many fishermen, he sells things that fishermen need. He has been doing well, since most of his customers are those same fishermen. James needs this loan to purchase more dry goods so that he can continue to serve his customers. \r\n\r\nJames hopes to become a successful businessman in the field of importation. His dreams include building his own house in a better environment and sending his children to a better

Shuhrat is a young guy who wishes to improve his business to be able to support his family and offer them a better quality of life. Four years ago, Shuhrat started selling car spare parts. His business has grown little by little; he now offers a variety of products. His starting capital was $1000 US from his savings. Today, Shuhrat has been working with IMON International for more than a year, and feels very satisfied with the support offered to him, because it has allowed him to increase his business, satisfy the needs of his customers and support his family. \r\n<p>\r\nShuhrat applied for a loan of $2400 US in order to purchase new goods for his store. He wants to develop his business and increase his income to save money and create a better life for his family.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International:<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its epic mountain passes and its rich history which includes its place as a key post along the Silk Road and events at the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

has a successful business selling foodstuffs at a market in Rudaki, Tajikistan. He started his business about 13 years ago, after evaluating different business possibilities and deciding this would be the best option and something he would enjoy. Radjab purchases produce at very low prices and then resells at a profit. Because he sells in bulk, he deals with a high inventory turnover rate. Radjab rents a very good location at the market for his business, and he has little competition. He has requested a loan of $800 US to increase his business capital. This loan will give him the ability to purchase more produce to sell, enabling him to increase his profits and continue operating a profitable business. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International:<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its epic mountain passes and its rich history which includes its place as a key post along the Silk Road and events at the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

M. lives in the village of Sitio, Cagay, Brgy. Su-ay, in the City of Himamaylan Negros Occidental. She is 47 years old and married to Rodolfo M., a Provincial Government employee. They have 12 children - the oldest is 27 years old and the youngest is only three. Most of their children are still in school. Even with such a big family to feed and raise, Leonida is contented with her life, determined to take care of her children and prepare them to face life once they're all grown up. She is indefatigable in her role as mother and wife.\r\n\r\nTo help her husband increase their income and set aside some money for their future security, Leonida set up a general store. When she started, she only had a little capital so she just carried the most basic household commodities that were in demand in her neighborhood. She decided not to sell food or candies in her store because she knew that her children would not be able to resist eating them, diminishing their income. For several years, she continued to just rollover her capital, earning a very small income. While it helped with their family expenses, her store was not expanding. She joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1995 to gain access to additional income so that she could finally expand her business. \r\n\r\nAs her income continued to improve, she was able to pay off her loans on time and maintain a good credit record with NWTF-Project Dungganon. Later, Leonida invested in a backyard hog-fattening project, which allowed her to involve her children in an income-generating activity by letting them take care of the pigs as part of their daily chores.  She has been operating her general store for 19 years now and she testifies that her continuing success is because she is dedicated, works hard, perseveres and is disciplined in her pursuit. This has improved the quality of life of her family. She presently earns PHP 6,000 average monthly profit from her business and it helps to pay for the family expenses, allows her to afford sending her children to school, and contributes to making their life more comfortable than before. \r\n\r\nHer previous loan of PHP 18,000 was used to add to her working capital. She paid all of her weekly installments on time and the loan was paid in full within its loan term. Now she is borrowing PHP 15,000 for her 16th loan cycle, again to invest in the expansion of her product offerings in her general store. She intends to use the income from this loan to do some house repair, pay for the tuition of her children and provide them with their daily allowance. \r\n\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":390576,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

D. is 57 years old, married with seven children ranging in age from 17 to 37 years old, with the youngest still going to school. The D. family lives in the village of Brgy, Rizal, Sagay City, Negros Occidental. Some of her children worked so that they could help shoulder the family's expenses. As her children grew older, the family expenses also increased, and it became obvious that her husband's income would not be able to sustain the family's increasing needs. This situation made her decide to start her own business to augment the family income. \n\nLeonila started a small food vending business in her local community. She sells \"bananacue\" and \"camotecue' - made by frying whole bananas and sliced sweet potatoes, then adding brown sugar into the oil once the banana or sweet potato is cooked, and caramelizing the sugar until it coats the banana or sweet potato. It is called \"bananacue\" and \"camotecue\" because they are sold skewered in bamboo barbecue sticks. She also sells \"Halo-halo\" - literally meaning mixed. \"Halo-halo\" is made with a mixture of candied fruit and jellies, scraped ice, milk and sugar. Corn Flakes and Leche Flan (Caramelized milk custard) are also added in many \"halo-halo\" recipes, and it can be topped with ice cream to make it more special. This is very popular during the hot summer months. She also sells ice candy made with frozen fruit juice or a frozen milk-based mixture.\n\nAside from her food vending business, Leonila also sells Ready-to-Wear clothes. She's been operating this business for thirty-seven years now and she continues to maintain a good relationship with her customers and maintains the good quality of her products. She earns about $88 a month from her business activities. The income covers some of the family income, provides the allowance of her youngest child who still goes to school, and the balance is reinvested into the business. \n\nLeonila has retained her good record with the Kiva field partner, NWTF-Project Dungganon. She paid off her thirteenth loan of PHP 19,500 on time, and it went a long way in providing her with a revolving working capital for her business. Now she is borrowing PHP 17,000 for her 14th cycle loan. She intends to use this loan to add to her working capital.\n\n\nAbout NWTF: \nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon. \n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":392272,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Her oldest child is 30 years old and the youngest is 22.  The family presently resides in the village of Brgy. Rizal, City of Sagay, Negros Occidental. Her husband works in the sugar mill in Sagay, but his income is not enough to sustain all the needs of their family. As a housewife, Lurinada is the one who budgets the family income, and she saw that it was not enough to support their family. She thought that it would be a good idea to have another source of income to supplement her husband's income.  \r\n\r\nTo have access to capital to build her own business, Lurinada joined the Kiva field partner, NWTF-Project Dungganon, in 2000.  With her first loan she set up a general store adjacent to their house.  Even though she  earned only a small income when she started, she persevered and reinvested part of her profits back into the business, and industriously paid her weekly loan installments. As she built her good credit rating with NWTF-Project Dungganon, she was able to access a larger loan, and with it she expanded her business activities and started selling dried fish, which further increased her income potential. \r\n\r\nFor over nine years, she managed to expand her business and this gave her an average monthly net profit of $109, which has been a big help to the family. Lurinada continues to maintain her good credit record: she just paid off her thirteenth loan of PHP 19,500 without a single delay. Now she is borrowing another PHP 19,500 to add to her revolving working capital for her business ventures.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just a few, but thousands of women.

G., 71, is a widow with nine adult children from the village of Brgy. Gargato, Hinigaran, Negros Occidental.  She may be a senior citizen with children ranging in age from 30 to 50, but she is a strong independent woman.<p>\r\n\r\nFlordeliza joined NWTF-Project Dungganon 16 years ago with the objective of setting up her own business and helping her husband support their family. She also liked the idea of being a member of an organization that empowers women out of poverty, and she used her first cycle loan to open a coffee shop adjacent to their house. With the help of her husband and children, she was able to build her business, and her coffee shop became a favorite among the locals, earning enough to be a significant help in meeting their family's expenses. <p>\r\n\r\nWhen her husband died, she was not left bereft as she had the means to continue supporting herself and her family. It also helped when her adult children started earning their own living, easing her financial burden.  As time passed, Flordeliza was able to buy a motorcycle with a sidecar for passengers which currently earns her additional income. Now that all of her children have their own families, Flordeliza is content that she is not a burden to them in her old age.<p>\r\n\r\nIn the 16 years that she has been a member, she has maintained a good credit record with NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her last loan of PHP 15,000 was fully repaid on time without any delays in the weekly installments. Now she is requesting another PHP 15,000 to add to her revolving working capital for her coffee shop.<p>\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day to achieving realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon.

A batey is a community of sugarcane field workers in the rural areas of the Dominican Republic. Bateyes are very remote, hard to access, and most people live in deep poverty. They often lack potable water, medicine, and any kind of reliable electricity.\r\n\r\nDespite these difficulties, Emilio runs a successful colmado in his community. Colmados are small local shops that carry anything from bread to batteries; Emilio\u2019s colmado is small, and he focuses on selling food. With this loan, Emilio will purchase rice, beans, and bread, among other types of food from the Dominican cuisine. \r\n\r\nEmilio lives in a small home in his batey with his wife and four children. His home is made from cement blocks, and was built by the local sugar company. He has lived here for 25 years. Emilio stays in business to support his family, and he hopes that with the money from his colmado he can send his children to school so they can \"become professionals in any field they enjoy\".

He started working there when he was 19.  He married at an early age; he and his wife have two children.  He lives in the Camilo Ortega neighborhood.  \r\n\r\nWhen he started working he was a helper collecting fees.  He earned less doing this, but he was able to become a driver.  It is hectic work because he leaves his house very early and does about ten routes around the city to be able to earn well in a day.\r\n\r\nThis is his sixth cycle with Afodenic.

Afiavi Honorine is married and has three children aged 11, 6, and 4, who are in 6th grade, 2nd grade, and kindergarten, respectively. The family has lived in Kow\u00e9gbo, a district in the city of Cotonou, for thirteen years. Afiavi Honorine runs as her main business the sale of fabric and jewelry, which she delivers on order and on credit to her clientele. Afiavi Honorine has diversified her business through the sale of various items (sweets, biscuits, cans of milk, sardines, tomatoes, sugar, food pastes, soap for laundry, dishes, and bathing, batteries, candles, etc.) and food (beans, rice, maize, cassava flour, etc.). It is in front of her house that Afiavi Honorine sells her goods. Afiavi Honorine has faced difficulties in obtaining supplies due to her low working capital. This is why she has been working with ALIDE (one of Kiva's field partners) since 2006. Afiavi Honorine has already obtained four loans through ALIDE, all of which she repaid without problems, and with which she was able to raise the standard of her business. To continue developing her business, Afiavi Honorine is seeking a fifth loan to strengthen her working capital.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Vilas Menon, Kiva

Por lo que con todo el esfuerzo logro obtener capital propio, y en parte de su familia que la apoyaron para establecer la pulper\u00eda. El financiamiento ser\u00e1 invertido en la compra de granos b\u00e1sicos que es lo que esta priorizando la gente al realizar las compras de sus casas. Su deseo es de poseer un mini s\u00faper que pueda surtir de todos los granos b\u00e1sicos a las personas que viven cerca de ella y que le brinden mayores ingresos a ella.","en":"Se\u00f1ora Claudia V\u00e1squez B. is 43 years old, married, and has one minor child.  For 4 years she has had a grocery store located in her house.  She started this business because she needed income for the maintenance of her family.  With much effort, she was successful in securing capital, and in part her family supported her in starting the store.  The current financing will be used to purchase staple grains, which is what people are prioritizing as they carry out purchases from their homes.  Her wish is to possess a mini supermarket that could supply all of the basic grains to the people who live near her and provide a better income for her.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by

Her relationship with her husband is very stable and they understand each other well. Her husband is works as a mason and they currently live in a house loaned to them by her brother.\r\n\r\nBlanca has a business selling fruit door to door. She has worked in this business for two years; she says somtimes business is good and other times it isn't. She more or less works from 6:30 in the morning until 3:30 in the afternoon every day. She also raises chickens, pigs, and guinea pigs. So if she is in need she can sell them to deal with her money problems.\r\n\r\nShe has been part of the community bank for three years. She is very happy with the group because the partners are very good friends and offer great support along with the benefits she receives from ESPOIR Foundation. Thanks to their loans she has been able to improve her situation a little more every day. \r\n\r\nWith the loan she receives from the foundation she will grow her business by offering a wider variety of fruits for her regular clients and work to gain new clients. \r\n\r\nHer dream is to improve every day and hopes to have her own fruit stand some day. \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

Her husband is living abroad. He went abroad in order to provide their children a better future, but the world economic crisis has prevented him from sending back much money. The home in which they live is the fruit of the couple's hard work and sacrifices, and Digna says that loans from the foundation have enabled her to repay some of her husband's debts.\r\n<p>\r\nDigna has a business selling fruit and vegetables. She also has a grocery store in her home which her sons help her run when she is not there. She is grateful to God for every day, be it good or bad.\r\n<p>\r\nShe has worked with her Community Bank for seven years and attends meetings every two weeks for training and to enjoy some leisure time with her friends in the group. \r\n<p>\r\nWith this loan from Fundaci\u00f3n ESPOIR, Digna will invest in her business by purchasing fruit and vegetables to sell.

Jocelyn is just starting this business.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Jocelyn joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Jocelyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from PMPC. Jocelyn is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP which she will use to purchase construction materials to repair her house. This loan will be the ninth loan taken out by Jocelyn from PMPC. She plans to have comfortable shelter for her family to live in. \r\n\r\n<b>About PMPC<\/b>\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Florence is married to Julien Dossou, an auto mechanic by training who has switched to selling second-hand vehicles. Florence is the mother of three children, all in school, of whom the eldest is in seventh grade. The family lives in Xwlacodji, a shantytown in Cotonou, the economic capital of the Republic of Benin. For 6 years, Florence has had a business selling charcoal; she runs this activity in her area in Xwlacodji. With the aim of enlarging her stock of charcoal and better satisfying her clientele, Florence took out her first loan through ALIDE (one of Kiva's field partners) in 2007. This loan experience was fruitful for Florence, and she recently began selling locally-produced alcoholic beverages. \r\nFlorence has already obtained four loans through ALIDE, all of which she repaid without problems, and with which she was able to raise the level of her business. To continue developing her business activities, Florence is seeking a fifth loan to strengthen her working capital.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Vilas Menon, Kiva

Those with EoT loans are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. EoT loans are AMK\u2019s main product because they are the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. EoT loans allow them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to. Most clients start to make their payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time.

She plans to use the additional income generated from the business to pay her loan, to sustain the daily needs of her family, and to prepare for her children's education.

S. is a 60-year-old widow who makes her livelihood in the countryside. She has three children, two of whom are married and live separately. S. runs a service sewing clothes at home.

is married with one child. He lives and works in his home town of Kamenka. Ruslan runs a small car shop selling spare vehicle parts. His shop is conveniently located right downtown Kamenka which makes it a frequently-visited place by numerous car owners. Ruslan business is very prospective. He started out small over 10 years ago. However, today Ruslan already has about 150,000 Grivnyas in inventory. His net profit amounts to 5,000-6,000 Grivnyas a month. \n\nRuslan is requesting a 17,000 Grivnya loan to buy a batch of winter tires for upcoming winter season. He wanted to invest lending funds into purchase of high quality and durable tires that he knows will sell really well this fall and winter.

the past 11 years, Kurbonoy has sold women\u2019s national dresses. She is the married mother of five children. She is determined to provide a better living for her entire family. Kurbonoy is hardworking and kind, giving her the ideal blend of entrepreneurial determination and strong customer service. Skilled in trade and abounding in character, Kurbonoy has a strong business base. \r\n<p>\r\nCurrently, she is seeking a loan of $1,000 to purchase a new vending facility so as to expand her business. With the increased income, Kurbonoy plans to continue growing her business and to improve the financial situation of her family.       \r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes being a key post along the Silk Road and being the location of the end of the rule of Alexander the Great. It is also known for its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi, and many others. The country, filled with epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and boasts a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nMore about IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

is married and has two children. He is honest, hard-working, very creative and full of new ideas. When he was working in the sphere of furniture production and assembly, he was always dreaming about starting his own business in that industry. However, he didn\u2019t have sufficient capital and he realized he had to provide for his family and cover household expenses. That is why he opened a grocery store.\r\n\r\nRustamkhon is requesting a loan to increase the range of his selling goods. This loan will give him a chance to buy a larger assortment of goods such as sugar, flour, vegetable oil, cereals, and many others. He believes the loan will boost his economic activity and help him generate more profits. It will not only help him grow his business but also give his family a better quality of life.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

and money shortages never defeated Rano, who has always looked for a way to get past obstacles and continue to improve her situation. Rano is an extremely hard-working and energetic woman. She is 40 years old, widow and has a child. For more than 7 years, she has operated a store where she sells kid\u2019s clothing. Her store is well known, and people love to visit because it's clean, tidy, and run by someone who is very kind and thoughtful. Rano hopes that her store will keep growing so that she can maintain a comfortable life for her dearest child. To make that possible, she has applied for a new loan that she will use to buy more clothing to sell. With this purpose Rano requests $2500 USD. She promises to repay the loan in time and thanks everyone supporting her.      \n \n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

One of their two children attends preschool.\r\n\r\nElsa started cooking and selling food items and breakfast goodies to her neighbors two years ago, the same year she joined the Center for Community Transformation (CCT) Credit Cooperative. Every morning, after cooking her food items, she sets up a small table for her wares in front of a friend\u2019s store along an alley where a lot of people pass by.  She is earning 4,000 Philippine pesos (about $85) a month. She is happy that she can help her husband augment their basic daily needs.\r\n\r\nShe is now in need of a loan in the amount of P8,000 to buy food ingredients. Some of the loan will go to her child\u2019s education. Elsa dreams of having her own permanent place of business, more like a restaurant.  \r\n\r\nAbout CCT\r\n\r\nThe Center for Community Transformation (CCT) is an organized Christian response against poverty and social injustice. This is carried out through the fusion of social development initiatives and evangelical mission in a uniquely Filipino context.

He is married and has three children. His wife is a retailer whose income is no longer able to cover the household expenses; it is for this reason that he decided in 2000 to start a business selling charcoal, something normally conducted by women. He runs this business in the Saint-Joseph district in Lom\u00e9. This business has allowed him to provide for his family. He enjoys good business these days and is proud of his income-generating activity. Currently, he needs to buy new bags; it is for this reason that he is seeking a loan through WAGES (one of Kiva's field partners) to buy 15 bags of charcoal. He is confident that his good faith and excellent knowledge of his market will allow him to repay this loan within the allotted time.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Vilas Menon, Kiva

She has survived many problems including shortages of capital and low inventory, illness, low sales, and even an accident while traveling. The business requires that she and her employees wake up well before dawn and travel to the town whose market day it is, set up their display and then serve the customers until long past sundown. Then they have to pack up everything again and travel home, only to follow the same routine the next day.  But she persists because she believes that with determination, patience, good customer relations, and honesty in all her dealings, she will be able to achieve her life's goal of supporting her family and providing her children with a secure future away from poverty.<p>\r\n\r\nThis is the life of Delia C., a 57-year-old married woman with four children. The oldest now has a family while the rest still live at home and help their parents in the business. She and her husband decided to go into this business because of its income potential. Delia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon  because she knew that she could borrow the capital she needed to start her business without securing the loan with a piece of property or other asset for collateral. At first she only sold small items from her home, but as time went by, her good credit record allowed her to borrow more and this enabled her to buy stocks in bigger bulks. At that point she started to go to different towns to sell her wares on their market days. She also began to employ some people to help her.<p>\r\n\r\nIn her nine years of running this business, Delia's loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon have been the catalyst that have allowed her to expand and make more plans to widen her territory. At present this business nets a monthly profit of PHP 9,000 which helps pay for her family's household expenses. In her 16th loan cycle she borrowed PHP 15,000 to help her maintain a certain stock volume of the wares she sells. This loan was fully paid on time without any delays in the weekly repayment. Now she is borrowing PHP 14,000 for her 17th loan cycle and she will again use this money as additional working capital for her business.<p>\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just a few but of thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a mere $1 a day to achieving realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon.

Alice lives in Fridjross\u00e8 in Cotonou, the economic capital of the Republic of Benin. Thanks to the income from her business, Alice is able to provide for herself. Alice sells charcoal at her house. Alice buys her products from haulers. Alice is a client of ALIDE (one of Kiva's field partners) who has always repaid her loans without incident. Alice needs greater financial means than what she possesses in order to increase her stock of charcoal.

A. is a business-minded and hardworking person who dreams of providing a better future for her family. She is 35 years old, married to Abner A., has four school-age children, and lives in the village of Purok 30, Barangay Taloc, Bago City, Negros Occidental.\r\n\r\nAbner, her husband, earns a living by driving a jeepney. Jeepneys are the most popular means of public transportation in the Philippines. The jeepney is like a small bus except that the passenger entrance is at the back and the passengers sit side by side on benches that face each other from both sides of the jeep's body. As a jeepney driver, Abner's income is not fixed and totally depends on the number of passengers he transports for the day who pay him seven pesos for the first four kilometers. He has to pay the daily rent to the jeepney's owner as well as pay for the fuel.\r\n\r\nBecause of her dream in life, Jocelyn strives hard to reach it. Even though she had only a small capital, she opened a small general store and she plowed most of her initial income back into the business so that she could offer her customers a wider variety from her store. She joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2001 to have access to additional capital so that she could expand her business and increase her income potential.\r\n\r\nAs she gained more profits from her business, Jocelyn expanded her business activities by setting up a food-vending business in her store. She offered a wide variety of food products to her customers. She still continues the food-vending because she noticed that food profits were a bit higher than those of her other products.\r\n\r\nAside from the general store and the food-vending businesses, Jocelyn is also engaged in the direct-selling of various products. Most of her customers in this side business are also her customers in the general store and live within her community. She also has a computer station in her store for children to play computer games for a fee.\r\n\r\nJocelyn started the original business eleven years ago and now her four business activities provide her with an average monthly income of PHP 20,000 per month.\r\n\r\nJocelyn is very happy about the outcome of her hard work and sacrifices for her family because she was to able to meet her dream in life. For her previous, 18th, loan she was able to obtain the amount of Php 28,000 and it was used as additional capital for her four businesses and it was paid back to NWTF-Project Dungganon on time without any delays in payment. This contributes to the good performance of Jocelyn.\r\n\r\nFor her 19th loan, Jocelyn proposed Php 15,000 which will be used to purchase additional items for her general store. If you look at the photo, it shows Jocelyn in her general store. At her back is the computer station that is played by the children.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few, but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":392885,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase additional items for her general store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Bago, Negros Occidental","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":145,"posted_date":"2009-09-24T13:20:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jocelyn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":15000,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1153.85},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1153.85},{"due_date":"2009-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1153.85},{"due_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1153.85},{"due_date":"2009-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1153.85},{"due_date":"2009-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1153.85},{"due_date":"2009-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1153.85},{"due_date":"2009-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1153.85},{"due_date":"2009-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1153.85},{"due_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1153.85},{"due_date":"2009-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1153.85},{"due_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1153.85},{"due_date":"2009-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1153.8}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":52,"local_amount":2400,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T00:31:12Z","rounded_local_amount":2461.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87088388,"comment":null},{"amount":98,"local_amount":4523,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T04:08:12Z","rounded_local_amount":4639.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97004136,"comment":null},{"amount":110,"local_amount":5077,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:08:41Z","rounded_local_amount":5207.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103848909,"comment":null},{"amount":65,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:59:33Z","rounded_local_amount":3077.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110739577,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-09-24T23:53:25Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:59:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":139119,"name":"Jos\u00e9 Anibal","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":" \nEn el municipio El Viejo en la ciudad de Chinandega, el joven Jos\u00e9 P. es muy emprendedor puesto que estableci\u00f3 su propio negocio de barber\u00eda donde atiende a sus clientes a diario brindando un buen servicio y con muy buenas condiciones.\n\nEl cr\u00e9dito que solicit\u00f3 es para inversi\u00f3n en la compra de materiales de trabajo como peines, gelatinas y tijeras y tambie\u00b4n para la compra de pintura para darle color a las paredes y tambi\u00e9n para reparar las sillas.

She tells us that there are good days and bad days, but one must give thanks to God for everything He provides to us.  Her many years of experience have enabled her to develop her clientele.  She also told us that thanks to her work she is able to obtain money on a daily basis to help with the household expenses and pay the rent on her parlor.  She works from 8am to 8pm from Monday to Saturday each week.  This is her sixth cycle with the communal bank.  She is very grateful to the foundation because it has allowed her to improve her business, to associate with other women to help generate their incomes, and, most importantly, to cultivate good friendships with all of the members of her bank.  With this loan that the ESPOIR foundation is giving her, she is going to purchase products such as: permanent solution, hair dyes, nail enamel, beauty treatments, etc., in order to improve her business and provide quality service.

A san is an operation in which several neighbors come together and put money into a collective each week for a predetermined amount of time and at the end of that time one member of the group receives a packet of goods. This is repeated until each member has had a turn receiving the packet. Thus it is a setup in which neighbors pool resources. In this case our associate is purchasing the goods to be given to each one of the members of her groups at the end of the cycle. She will collect a fee for providing the goods.\r\n\r\nWith the profits from this enterprise Lucrecia intends to invest in adding a concrete floor to her house (something which will greatly improve her living conditions and reduce exposure to disease) and to purchase glasses for her daughter to enable her to see.

L. is from the village of Poblacion,Sinacaban , Misamis Occidental. She is 44 years old. Julieta is married and has 1 school-age child. To make a living, Julieta owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector operating a specialized \"food and sari-sari\" retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap & toothpaste etc.in the local community. Julieta has been engaged in her business for over 18 years and earns approximately 4,000.00 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Julieta joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Julieta has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000.00 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Julieta is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP which will also be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the 4th loan taken out by Julieta from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

M. is from the village of Sta. Maria Tangub City. She is 50 years old. Nieva is married and has 5 school-age children. To make a living, Nieva owns & operates a business venture in the services sector operating a \"mais\" corn products business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising and selling crops. Nieva has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 8,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Nieva joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Nieva has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,000 PHP from GDMPC. Nieva is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to purchase materials needed to provide service. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Nieva from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children and to help with the family's daily needs. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva

R. is from the village of Sto. Ni\u00f1o, Tukuran, Zamboanga del sur. She is 36 years old. Rebecca is married and has 3 school-age children. To make a living, Rebecca owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector operating a specialized fruit retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling fruit in the local community. Rebecca has been engaged in her business for over 1 year and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Rebecca joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Rebecca has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Rebecca is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Rebecca from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

C. is 35 years old and married with three children whose ages range from 6 to 16 years old. The eldest two children attend school. The family lives in the village of Sitio Napulo, Brgy. Cerantes, Escalante City, Negros Occidental. As a mother, Arlene is always looking ahead and thinking about her children's future. She makes plans for when they grow up; she wants to send them to school and get a college degree, and later have a stable job, have their own family, and be free from poverty. But then she sometimes questions how her dreams can be fulfilled because her husband's income is too small and not sufficient even to cover their household expenses. \r\n<p>\r\nWith these aspirations in mind, Arlene began to help her husband by selling seaweed in the local market and other neighboring places. The little she earned helped defray the household expenses and support her children's school-related needs. She then decided to expand her business to earn more, and so asked around about where and how she could access additional capital to do this. It was at this time that she learned about NWTF-Project Dungganon and how it could help her financial needs. In 1996, Arlene became a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon, and she used her first loan cycle to increase the volume of her seaweed business. She diligently paid her weekly installments and maintained her good credit record so that she could take advantage of a larger loan in the next cycle. By so doing she increased her income. She then had enough capital to start another business, a general store in her neighborhood. The store now earns 3,000 PHP a month to supplement the family income.\r\n<p>\r\nArlene is a shrewd businesswoman and plans her cash flow well. In her previously cycle, she borrowed 17,000 PHP, which she used to invest in her business. She was able to fully pay it on time and without any delays. This time around, for her ninth cycle loan, she is borrowing only 6,000 PHP. This is because she anticipates that demand for her products will drop because people in her neighborhood will have less disposable income as it is off-season for the biggest employers in the area \u2013 the sugar mill and sugar plantations. She intends to add the loan to her revolving working capital in her general store.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>About NWTF<\/b><br>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":392760,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"As additional capital for the business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Escalante, Negros Occidental","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":145,"posted_date":"2009-09-24T21:10:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Arlene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":6000,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2009-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2009-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2009-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2009-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2009-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2009-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2009-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2009-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2010-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2010-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2010-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2010-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2010-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2010-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":240}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":6,"local_amount":240,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T00:31:32Z","rounded_local_amount":284.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87088389,"comment":null},{"amount":120,"local_amount":4800,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T04:06:39Z","rounded_local_amount":5680.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97004137,"comment":null},{"amount":12,"local_amount":480,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:54:04Z","rounded_local_amount":568.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123965801,"comment":null},{"amount":12,"local_amount":480,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:37:42Z","rounded_local_amount":568.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128997716,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-09-24T21:18:23Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T09:37:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":139195,"name":"Maria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maria is 57 years old and married to Alfredo, a village policeman.

In the morning she sells sells vegetables which she usually purchased in Cauayan public market. In the afternoon, she will then sell different snacks like halo-halo (is a popular Filipino dessert that is a mixture of shaved ice and milk to which are added various boiled sweet beans and fruits, and served cold in a tall glass or bowl).  Aside from this she also sells barbecue stick. As a young parent, she will do everything to become a responsible mother to her eldest child and future children. Life will be difficult without her cooperation and initiative to start a business. She just hope that her business will not be affected by calamities and other factors that could possibly affect her business growth. \n\nNestly is asking for financial support from KIVA lenders. She is requesting to avail a loan of PHP4, 000 to be use as her additional capital and to maintain her business.  She hopes to avail the said loan because she believes that it will make her business become progressive. And she wanted the loan to gain income by investing it to her business. She really hopes that her loan will be

D., who lives in the the village of Baranrgay Nanunga, Hinigaran, Negros Occidental, is 50 years old and married to Eduardo D., who is a 64 year old pensioner. They have five children ranging in age from 16 to 30 years old. The older children have finished their studies and only the two youngest are still in school.\r\n\r\nGilda is a natural entrepreneur who is always looking for opportunities to earn more for her family and provide her children with a brighter future. Because she wanted to help her husband support their family, she engaged in a food-vending business by making different kinds of native delicacies and sold them within the community and in the neighboring villages. Aside from this, she also put up a general store adjacent to their house. \r\n\r\nWith her entrepreneurial spirit whetted, Gilda was inspired to expand her food vending business and her general store and she needed additional capital to accomplish this. So she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 to have access to the much needed capital. The new loans allowed her to expand her operations, which in turn resulted in a higher income.\r\n\r\nFrom the subsequent loans, she was able to diversify to a third business - pig fattening and the three businesses allowed her to earn PHP 7,500 per month. She is grateful to NWTF-Project Dungganon for providing her with the means to expand her business through the easy-installment loans.\r\n\r\nHer previous loan of PHP 12,000, which was her 11th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon, did well for her business and allowed her to maintain her good credit standing when she paid off each installment on time until it was completely paid. Now on her 12th cycle, she is borrowing PHP 14,000 to add to the revolving working capital of her businesses.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few, but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":392139,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General
