She remembers that 7 years ago she had a store where she sold a little of everything; unfortunately she closed it for health reasons, as she wasn't able to give it the full attention and energy that it required.  After some time her health improved, and since she had leftover bottles of sodas she began to sell them again, but now she only sells drinks.  Currently her business is in her home where she re-purposed an area to attend to the customers.  She wants to use her loan to buy drinks.  The business that she hopes to have in the future is selling clothes.  She wants to find a place in a commercial zone where she can put a clothes bazaar.  She hopes to achieve this very soon.  On the other hand, as president of the group \"Unidas para alcanzar el exito\" (united to reach success) she is learning a lot.  There are 7 members that make up the group, and they are all very punctual in their payments.\r\n\r\n*Natalia is dressed in the yellow shirt.

It is located in the state of M\u00e9xico and consists of 13 members. Among them is Se\u00f1ora Maria del Carmen P. H., who is 35 years old. She has been married for 16 years and has 5 children, 2 girls and 3 boys, who are all in school. She sells natural foods and has been doing this for 6 years. She comments that she decided to begin her business because her husband's income many times wasn't enough to cover their necessities and those of their children. She had already applied for loans in the past and comments that with this new loan she will benefit a lot, since she can buy wholesale and thus obtain better prices, increasing her earnings. \r\n\r\nHer dream is that some day she can set up a shop where she can sell her products and have at least two employees from the her community. Se\u00f1ora Maria del Carmen wants to be able to give her children careers, since she was not able to finish her schooling because she married very young and had to help her parents with the household economics. She did this with great pleasure, but she wants a better future for her children. She joined with the other members of the group and formed a soccer team in their district, and they have represented their town with dignity for several years, which brought them great personal satisfaction."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3750,"image":{"id":709944,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Buy natural foods","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Estado de M\u00e9xico","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":158,"posted_date":"2011-03-02T02:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mayra Marlen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maribel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gabriela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Del Refugio Sandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adriana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Rafaela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bibiana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gabriela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria De Jesus","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marisela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Minerva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":45000,"loan_amount":3750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":2310},{"due_date":"2011-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":2369},{"due_date":"2011-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":2430},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2492},{"due_date":"2011-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":2556},{"due_date":"2011-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2622},{"due_date":"2011-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2689},{"due_date":"2011-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2758},{"due_date":"2011-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2829},{"due_date":"2011-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2902},{"due_date":"2011-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2976},{"due_date":"2011-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":3053},{"due_date":"2011-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3131},{"due_date":"2011-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3211},{"due_date":"2011-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3294},{"due_date":"2011-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":3378}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":197.42},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":202.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":207.66},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":213},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":218.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":224.09},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.83},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":235.75},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":241.83},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":248},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":254.42},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":260.92},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":267.58},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":274.5},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":281.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1921.25,"local_amount":23055,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:43:56Z","rounded_local_amount":23121.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201264221,"comment":null},{"amount":1005.17,"local_amount":12062,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:39:26Z","rounded_local_amount":12096.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206131126,"comment":null},{"amount":823.58,"local_amount":9883,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:56:01Z","rounded_local_amount":9911.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211203348,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-03-09T12:17:48Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T10:56:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":272102,"name":"Roland","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Roland and Alma S. own My Culinary Solution, a staffing agency connecting culinary professionals to companies in need of their talents.  They provide their clients trained personnel ranging from dishwashers to professional chefs, be it for a few hours or several months.  Roland and Alma maintain a database of professionals registered with My Culinary Solution, which they use to evaluate suitable personnel for their clients.  \r\n\r\nOutside of My Culinary Solution, Roland is the operating manager for all food venues at a Houston-area college.  He oversees everything from specially catered events to student dining options.  Roland has extensive experience in the food-service industry.  After starting in the food industry as a dishwasher, Roland went on to become a chef before moving into operations management.  Roland\u2019s extensive industry experience provides him the insight and expertise necessary to facilitate good matches between clients and employees.\r\n\r\nRoland and Alma prepared themselves for small business ownership by taking business start-up courses at a local university.   Alma handles the My Culinary Solution\u2019s day-to-day operations, with the help of a bilingual assistant and sales representative.  She says her biggest challenge at the moment is raising awareness of My Culinary Solution and the services it offers.  As Alma explains, many people have not heard of this kind of business.  \r\n\r\nMoney for this loan is being used for advertising through local media outlets, as well as for helping meet initial payroll expenses.  In addition to advertising through newspapers, Alma is growing the business by contacting culinary training institutions to connect with soon-to-graduate students in need of work.  \r\n\r\nThey believe My Culinary Solution offers a service that has the potential to take off in a big way, and hope to someday expand the business beyond the Houston area.  But those are dreams for down the road.  With the business still in its early stages, Roland works up to 16 hour days between his full-time job and My Culinary Solution.  Small business ownership is a challenge that excites them, and they are wholly dedicated to making My Culinary Solution a sustainable business.

It includes tips and tools for handling a variety of tasks, from ordering flowers to creating registries, even offering a final wedding day checklist for the maid of honor.\n\nAlbert explains that the planner isn\u2019t meant to cover every contingency, but serve as a point of reference.  \u201cIf this were a complete list, then this would be a cookie-cutter event, and you\u2019d sign up for a color and a date, and we\u2019d crank you through.  But it\u2019s not supposed to do that.  This is supposed to be your great day.  You\u2019ve never done this before, so you need a starting point. This is your starting point.\u201d\n\nPublishing the book is a team effort. Albert handles advertisement sales and the book\u2019s distribution.  Cece does editing and advertisement design.  All of the firms that advertise in \u201cThe Wedding and Quince\u00f1eara Planner\u201d distribute copies of the book to their customers.  Cece and Albert print an updated copy of \u201cThe Wedding and Quincea\u00f1era Planner\u201d every 6 months.\n\nAlbert and Cece provide the \u201cThe Wedding and Quicea\u00f1era Planner\u201d free to customers because they generate revenue through advertisements.  Unfortunately, this year some of the advertisers were late with their payments.  \u201cWe had been expanding until about a year ago, when we had a few advertisers decide not to renew their contracts. This fall, we had more that decided not to renew, and I had a hard time collecting the money.\u201d  Because publishing requires up-front payment, this put them in a bind. \u201cWe decided we needed to do something to get the books printed so we\u2019d have them to hand out at the wedding fair.  We went to the bank and didn\u2019t quite meet their criteria, but she recommended ACCION to us.\u201d\n\nThe loan provided Albert and Cece the funds needed to publish the planner in time for the semi-annual wedding fair, their biggest business event.  Without this loan, Albert and Cece would have had to refund what advertising revenues they had collected and would not have been able to publish the book.  Albert and Cece advise other business owners to \u201cKeep an eye on your receivables.  Don\u2019t expect it (money) to automatically flow in.\u201d\n\nAlbert and Cece believe in the long-term potential of their business as much as they believe in the product they offer.  Albert says that business is picking up again, and that he and Cece are continuing to receive positive feedback from customers.  \u201cOne couple told me, \u2018I bought a formal planner, but it hasn\u2019t been nearly as informative as your book\u2019\u2026 That\u2019s rewarding.  Knowing that a couple is sampling from your publication and they\u2019re on the right feet.\u201d\n\nAlbert and Cece started this business six years ago, after family friends started a similar business in another city.  They saw that Corpus Christi didn\u2019t have an equivalent service, and decided to create one based on their friends\u2019 recommendation.  Albert and Cece and their five children are supported by this business.

He sells dairy products in the local bazaar. \n\nIn January 2011, Sattar joined AqroInvest and requested a loan of 1800 AZN which was used to purchase livestock feed and three more cows.

S. is from the village of Sta Lucia, Quirino, Isabela.

Claverina has been engaged in her business for over 14 years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month from it.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Claverina joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Claverina has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from ASKI, which was used to purchase breeding livestock. Claverina is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will again be used to purchase breeding livestock. This will be the 6th loan taken out by Claverina from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's general living conditions. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the culturA. context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. \r\n\r\nIn order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principA. loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

Josefina is married to Maximo, a farmer, and they have one child, who now works and has a family. \r\n\r\nJosefina has a farm where she grows ornamental plants and fruits like bananas and pineapples. This farm is located near their house, so Josefina can easily manage it.

Monthly, Josefina earns around Php 11,500.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her ornamental farm, she would like to request for a Php20,000 loan. She does so to further help her grow her farm. She intends to use the loan money to buy fertilizers, a crop growth regulator called ethrel, and plastic and wire for the physical maintenance of the farm. She believes that the loan will truly benefit her business, and eventually her family and community.\r\n\r\nFrequent typhoons that hit the country also affected Josefina's farm. But despite these storms in her life, she is still determined to see her farm yield many fruits and become more profitable in the years to come.

With these businesses, Edzel earns roughly Php 10,000 every month.\r\n\r\nTo help him continue the operation of his businesses, he would like to request a Php 28,000 loan. With the loan money, he plans to buy more goods for his store, such as soft drinks, canned goods, and snacks sold retail. He believes he will be able to increase his income by expanding the inventory of his store.\r\n\r\nEdzel has his own share of difficulties, but he is confident to say that he is not overwhelmed by them. He looks forward to being able to renovate their house by putting tiles on their floor. Also, it is his desire for his sari-sari store to grow and eventually become a grocery, which can meet the needs of his community better than a small store. Most importantly, far beyond the bounty is his yearning to see his children finish schooling and surpass the success that he has achieved. \r\n\r\nAs a CCT community partner, he faithfully attends group's weekly fellowship* meeting where he also can draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God he receives.\r\n\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":710173,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"purchase of

Julieta reached college before getting married to Aristardo, a businessman. At present, they work hand-in-hand in making their business grow and become sufficient enough to support their daily living. Julieta uses her learning from CCT* as a Community Partner to boost her business.  Together, they lived in Tanza, Cavite.\r\n<p>\r\nBeing a fruits vendor is Julieta's main occupation. She has a commercial space in the public market of their community, where daily she sells fresh fruits to household people who go to the market to buy some real food. Other than fruits, she also sells barley products. This business she operates without any employees working for her, and monthly she earns roughly Php 12,000.\r\n<p>\r\nTo help her grow her business, Julieta applies for a Php 8,000 loan. She will use the money to buy more quantities of fruits for sale, specifically bananas and mangoes. She also plans to buy supplementary materials like salt and plastic. \r\n<p>\r\nJulieta admits having lots of competitors in the market that have the same products she has. Also, the death of her mother led them to use part of the capital to pay medical expenses. But Julieta believes that she can surpass these challenges and make her business grow. She plans to have a commercial space for a fruit stand in a shopping mall, where more people can serve as prospective customers. Julieta desires to make her business really profitable, because by it she can assure a bright future for her family, her utmost treasure.\r\n<p>\r\nAs a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she received.\r\n<p>\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":710185,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

Linda was able to finish her first year in college. Now at 51, she makes sure that she will finish to the end every task she lays her hands on with excellence. She is married to a cook named Rolando, and together they raise three children in GMA, Cavite.\r\n<p>\r\nLinda's task at hand is a business in coin bank making. She picks out quality materials, hires around eight employees who will work for her on a piece rate, and keeps an eye for excellence to produce crafts that customers would brand as quality and worth buying. Linda has been for 10 years in this kind of business and is still counting. As of now, the business is still residential. Monthly, she earns around Php 10,000.\r\n<p>\r\nTo help her grow her business, Linda decides to ask for a loan of Php 50,000. This will be used purely for business: for improving the process of craft making, purchasing only the quality materials, and making sure the business stays profitable. Linda says the loan will really help her keep the coin bank making in good shape.\r\n<p>\r\nLinda speaks of the rainy season as a challenge to her business, as well as the school opening, since she has to use part of the business money for her children's tuition fees. No matter what the challenges are, however, she is ever determined to thoughtfully figure out how to make the finances flow smoothly in her business. She desires to have her own coin bank factory, and just like any ordinary person, she prays for good health and a good life for each member of her dear family.\r\n<p>\r\nAs a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she received.\r\n<p>\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

They have requested a loan of SLL 500,000 for each, and with the help of this loan, these teachers are in a strong position to buy or invest in something that their mere salaries can not let them do.\r\n\r\nMichael K.

This will be his first loan, which he is planning to use to prepare his land for wheat farming. He hopes to use the profit from this loan to acquire more land for farming to increase his wheat production and to educate his children. His hopes and dreams are to become a large scale farmer, buy a bigger piece of land and build a plot. Rumpene is a young and energetic man who can do more if supported financially.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":710238,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to prepare his land for planting wheat","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Narok","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.516667 36.866667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":133,"posted_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Rumpene ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-02-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":10000,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":6500,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-17T07:53:33Z","rounded_local_amount":6597.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221994595,"comment":null},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":3500,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T09:45:02Z","rounded_local_amount":3552.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227077010,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-03-01T14:59:18Z","paid_date":"2011-09-15T09:45:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":272306,"name":"Robert","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Robert M. was born in 1963, in Gandzakar village, an area of Ijevan.

Ana works arduously on her farm to improve her crops and make her land more productive.  Along with her oldest daughter, she works from very early in the morning planting potatoes and beans.  She will then take her products to sell in the wholesale market in Tarma.   The thing she likes most about her job is planting and watching her crops grow.

It is recognized in the community and she still works hard to make it grow.  She has many customers, but she doesn't have enough money to increase her sales, so she is asking for a second loan to purchase more natural medicine products.

She uses her creativity in her designs.  She needs money to purchase paint in order to continue painting, so she has asked FAPE for a second loan.  She used her first loan to make drawings of different landscapes and her paintings sold for good prices.

She has bought and sold footwear for the past two years, working directly out of her home. She also works on location at a school where she holds an administrative role. When she started out in commerce about six years ago, she was selling empanadas and clothing. However, selling shoes has brought in more profits. With the loan, she plans to purchase footwear in the city of Puc\u00f3n, and in this way she will have more sales possibilities with the end goal of earning more income. Ximena lives with her husband and her two daughters, who help her with the business during the summertime (January and February). She has a sales post in Puc\u00f3n, which her daughters, ages 19 and 12, tend to. Her husband also helps when he has free days from his work as a public transportation driver. Ximena's dream is to have a sales post in Talcahuano and in this way become more independent. Her motivation to continue with the business is to finance her daughter's higher education since she is studying at an institute. Kiva partner Fondo Esperanza has provided Ximena and her business a lot of support, and she has been touched by her good treatment, the friendship and the responsibility.

Erica S., owner of Nola Green Transportation, manages food delivery for restaurants that do not have the delivery volume to merit having their own drivers.  By using NGT, restaurants can offer delivery service to their clients without losing the time it takes to deliver.  \n\nOriginally a Texas native, Erica moved to New Orleans after high school to attend Tulane University.  Unable to obtain sufficient financial aid for her studies, she went back to working full-time at a restaurant \u2013 something she had been doing since she was 14.  She says she first had the idea of NGT when she began noticing the time that was lost when restaurant staff had to take off to deliver an order.\n\nErica has rolling two-month contracts with restaurants, meaning the contracts automatically renew unless the restaurant decides to opt out.  Some current clients include Mexican, Moroccan, Middle-Eastern, Spanish and Cajun restaurants.  Erica\u2019s drivers pick up the food from the restaurants and deliver it to the customers.  Right now, Erica has two drivers and will soon hire a third.\n\nErica is using this loan for operating capital, payment of accumulated debts, and for two months of office rent.  She always needs cash on hand because her drivers are sub-contractors (they buy the food from the restaurants and then collect payment from the customers).  At the end of the day, Erica reimburses her drivers for the money they pay the restaurants.  When Erica\u2019s customers pay with credit cards, Erica does not receive payment from the credit card companies for two days.  This loan gives Erica the needed cushion to pay her drivers until she receives payment from the credit card companies.\n\nRight now, Erica consistently works 13- and 14-hour days.  Though these are long hours, she likes owning her own business because of the freedom it provides her.  She recommends other business owners be realistic when setting goals \u2013 things take three times longer than you think they should.  With the added hassle of billing through credit card companies, she also recommends dealing in cash whenever possible.\n\nErica opened Nola Green Transportation, LLC in September, 2010.  She says NGT\u2019s biggest success so far is that it became profitable within the first four months of opening.

Tag-ube, Compostela, Cebu. She earns her living by operating a general store.  Her husband Alejandro B., who is 41 years old, works as a vendor to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have 2 children who are 19 and 21 years old. \r\n\r\nBelinda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 9 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Belinda has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 10th loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000, with which she intends to buy more items for the general store so that she can continue to save up for the future improvement of her business.\r\n\r\n Belinda B. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She earns her living by operating a general store and an auto repair shop. Her husband Francisco S., who is 30 years old, works as a mechanic to earn his living.  They have two children who are 2 and 3 years old. \r\n\r\nMa.Glenda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2009 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 3 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Ma.Glenda has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 7,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6,700, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 4th loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000, with which she intends to buy items for the general store to sell to her customers so that she can continue to save up for her children's education. \r\n\r\nMa.Glenda S. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\n About NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

D. is a single woman who lives in Brgy. Tan-awan, Oslob, Cebu.  She earns her living by operating fish vending and livestock businesses. Rosenda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 12 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Rosenda has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,400, uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 13th loan, she is borrowing PHP 18,000, which she intends to use for additional capital for the business so that she can continue to save up for future house repair. Rosenda D. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Richardson, Jr. said, \u201cWhen it comes to the future, there are three kinds of people: those who let it happen, those who make it happen, and those who wonder what happened.\u201d Definitely, our CCT* Community Partner Emily A. is one who falls among the second group. At 61, she makes her dreams happen. Emily reached only high school, but just like her fellow community partners, this simple educational background has not served as a major hindrance to her in becoming a good micro-entrepreneur. Emily is married to Jose; together, they brought up five children in Santa Clarissa, Tanza, Cavite.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Emily manages her own sari-sari (variety) store, as well as a computer shop. She has these businesses running a few steps from home, which makes it easier for her to keep an eye on their day-to-day operations. She does not hire any employees, managing to run both the shop and the store on her own. Monthly Emily earns around Php 11,280. \r\n\r\nIn prudence Emily decided to borrow Php 20,000. She did so  primarily to help her grow her sari-sari store. She opted to purchase rice, assorted groceries, and soft drinks. Also, she plans to buy an additional computer for her computer shop and some computer software.\r\n\r\nEmily takes it a personal challenge to keep going on with her business and unceasingly pray for its growth. Nevertheless, she knows that with the Lord by her side there is nothing to worry about. She intends to save her profits and invest in another business in preparation for the future of her family because for her, success is something you don\u2019t simply wait for; you have to make it happen.\r\n\r\nAs a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends their group's weekly fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she has received.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":710801,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

is a life far from financial lack, but also his is the determination not to settle for anything less than the best God has in store for him. His name is Alberto G., 31. Having finished college, Alberto is off to a good start when it comes to business. He currently lives with Jeodalyn in Tanza, Cavite, along with their only child, who is not yet of school-going age. Like Alberto, Jeodalyn is into business.\r\n\r\nAlberto runs his own computer shop near their home. He has been doing so for five years now without needing any help from hired employees or assistants. His business meets the huge demand of his community when it comes to internet access. Basically, he caters to the younger generation from the middle class, who need access to online sources for homework, projects, and entertainment. With this Alberto earns around Php 10,000 monthly.\r\n\r\nTo help him continue operation of his businesses, he is requesting a Php 11,000 loan. He will use the money to add to his savings and buy three additional monitors.  He knows this will greatly benefit his computer shop as this will enable him to cater to more customers.\r\n\r\nThe present condition of the Philippine economy is one challenge Alberto mentions. However, he believes that as an entrepreneur with good potential, he is able to overcome such a challenge and pursue his dream of putting up another computer shop. Of course, he would want his family to be the primary beneficiaries of his success.

The store is situated at home so he has easily managed it daily for three years now without any helpers. He is able to earn Php 10,640 monthly on average. To help him grow his business, he is applying for a loan of Php 8,000. He will use the loan to buy more soft drinks as well as groceries with which to fill his store shelves. He knows that with these products he will be able to make his store more profitable.\r\n\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

people would love simplicity in life.

She is married to Jaime, and together they raise eight children in their home in Dasmarinas, Cavite.\r\n\r\nOne strategy Amia employed to fight the curse of a poor educational background is to run her own sari-sari (variety) store near their home. The training and fellowship she experiences in CCT* as a Community Partner enabled her to set it up and continually operate it. With this, she is able to earn around 7,300 Philippines pesos (Php) per month.\r\n\r\nSimple as it is, her sari-sari store needs leveling up. Amia is requesting a Php15,000 loan. She needs this money to buy new products to fill her store shelves. Also, she has to replenish her stock of salable items such as noodles and coffee sachets.\r\n\r\nEven a simple life is not devoid of struggles, and Amia has her share of those. However, she sees them not worth mentioning. Instead, she speaks of her dream of becoming prosperous and having their own family car. She wants to be assured of her family being well off toward a good future.\r\n\r\nAs a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she received.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly bA..

She only reached high school, but with the determination she has to succeed, her poor educational background doesn't matter much. Mira is married to a driver named Benjamin and together they raise two children. One child is already in college, while the other is in elementary school.They live in Paliparan Site, Dasmari\u00f1as, Cavite.\r\n\r\nRunning a <i>sari-sari<\/i> (variety store) is what occupies Mira's daily schedule. She determines which retail items are most needed and wanted by her community and buys them at the local market. She displays them on her store shelves in a way that will immediately get the attention of people in her neighborhood who might need a sachet of shampoo or a bottle of vinegar just to keep going with their busy lives. Aside from her sari-sari store and Benjamin's jeepney operation, they also raise pigs to meet the family's needs. Monthly, they earn around 10,380 Philippine pesos (PHP).\r\n\r\nTo help expand her sari-sari store, Mira applied for a loan of 8,000 PHP. She plans to use this money to purchase more retail items such as canned goods, detergents and instant noodles among other things. With this loan, she will make sure that her store will be capable of meeting the immediate needs of her community.\r\n\r\nMira hopes to see her small store grow into a grocery. Therefore, she goes all out to address her challenges and become a better entrepreneur.

it comes to improving her efforts to reach her goals, for Cipriana Casa, 41, there are no holds barred. Cipriana constantly improves and rises up to her business needs as well as to her relationship with her family. She is the wife of Teodoro, who is also in business, and the mother of two children, one who studies in high school and one who is in elementary school.  Together they live in Carissa Homes, Tanza, Cavite.\r\n\r\nCipriana runs both an electronic shop and a sari-sari (variety) store located near their home. The electronic shop serves as her primary business.  In it she offers repair services for broken televisions and DVD\u2019s to her neighborhood . Cipriana has been in business for nine year now. With these entrepreneurial efforts she earns Php13,960 on average per month.\r\n\r\nTo help her grow her business, she decided on a loan of Php10, 000.  For her this is a way to improve her business. With this money on hand, she can purchase spare parts of television sets and DVD\u2019s, which are much needed in her shop. She believes that a complete set of materials is what she needs to improve her shop, and it will also eventually help her sustain their family\u2019s needs.\r\n\r\nIncreased fares and higher prices of spare parts are the main challenges Cipriana combats at present. She also struggles with the poor health of the family. But she faces these challenges head on, knowing that she has what it takes to succeed, all the more with the Lord  ready to back her up. She hopes to become stable in terms of her business capital, in order to be able to sustain the studies of her two dear children.\r\n\r\nAs a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she received. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":711004,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Electronics Repair","sector":"Services","use":"To buy spare parts of televisions and DVD\u2019s","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Tanza, Cavite","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-02-12T22:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cipriana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":3333.33,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:29:09Z","rounded_local_amount":3641.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195814238,"comment":null},{"amount":33.34,"local_amount":1333.36,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:37:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1456.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201256803,"comment":null},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:33:51Z","rounded_local_amount":2913.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206123496,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2666.63,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:49:34Z","rounded_local_amount":2913.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211194776,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-02-13T16:12:50Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T10:49:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":272545,"name":"Lorna","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lorna M., 44, has got big dreams, and she\u2019s working out her entrepreneurial capabilities to reach them.

Carmen is married to Francisco, and together they are raising a big family of eight children. Just like Carmen, Francisco is also a vendor. They currently live in Tanza, Cavite.\r\n\r\nCarmen is a vegetable vendor offering fresh food options for her fellow community members who have the time to cook their own food at home. Having been four years in business, she knows which kinds are appealing, and which vegetables rarely sell. She also applies her learning from CCT* to her business, and earns around Php12, 880 monthly.\r\n\r\nTo help her grow her business, she decided on a loan amount of Php8, 000. She intends to use this money to buy more fresh vegetables, such as sweet potatoes, beans, and okra.  Other items for purchase are onions, garlic, and ginger. \r\n\r\nOne challenge Carmen faces is the unstable prices of vegetables, which greatly affects her business. Also, she finds it hard to sustain her business capital. Nevertheless, she is on the lookout for solutions to these dilemmas and will see to it that her business will become sustainable. She hopes to be able to save up for emergency purposes, and to be able to further improve her business. Basically, all of these represent her effort to make sure that she will be able to sustain her family\u2019s daily living and support them in reaching for their dreams.\r\n\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.
