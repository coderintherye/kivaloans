They live together in their own home which is located in Puerto Cocos community, in Pichari.\r\n\r\nTeresa is an excellent cook who knows how to prepare delicious stews which are to her customers' tastes.  At first it was difficult to achieve the positioning that she now has but, thanks to her patience, the good flavor of her food and her commitment, she has managed to become more popular than her competitors.  Her husband is the one who helps her the most in her work.  He takes care of serving the customers and providing them with the most friendly service possible in order to make them feel comfortable.  Teresa also has a young girl who helps her in the kitchen.  She is happy with the business that she has.  However, she must obtain all kinds of products.  For example, if she receives orders for a dish which is more typical of the mountain region of Peru, it becomes difficult to get hold of certain supplies she needs.\r\n\r\nThis will be Teresa's third loan from MFP and she pledges, once more, to make her repayments on time.  She will use her 2,000 soles to buy chairs for her restaurant.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":593.36,"image":{"id":884261,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"to buy chairs for her restaurant","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-09-30T11:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":305.88},{"due_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":314.66},{"due_date":"2011-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":327.78},{"due_date":"2012-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":338.09},{"due_date":"2012-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":350.44},{"due_date":"2012-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":363.15}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.88},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":114.07},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.82},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":122.55},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.04},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.64}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":110.88,"local_amount":305.88,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:55:42Z","rounded_local_amount":306.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238666616,"comment":null},{"amount":114.07,"local_amount":314.66,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:05Z","rounded_local_amount":315.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621765,"comment":null},{"amount":118.82,"local_amount":327.78,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:51:22Z","rounded_local_amount":328.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250835846,"comment":null},{"amount":122.55,"local_amount":338.09,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:17:36Z","rounded_local_amount":338.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245603,"comment":null},{"amount":127.04,"local_amount":350.44,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:31:02Z","rounded_local_amount":351.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263385657,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-10-09T11:45:17Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":341614,"name":"Mubiru","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mubiru is 45 years old and lives in the town of Luwero in the Luwero region of Uganda.

Selling some part of the harvest, he earns about 6,800 soms to meet the family's needs. \r\n\r\nKubanychbek is requesting a loan because he needs money to purchase 100 liters of fuel and 100 packs of hay and to pay for tractor driver services. In the future, he  wants to provide his sons with a good education.\r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused microfinance institution in Kyrgyzstan.

is a resident of Ananievo. She is 41 and married to a driver. Together with her husband, she has raised two daughters and a son. Her daughters are married and live separately with their families and the son has just graduated from school. Two years ago with an initial investment of 1,500 soms, Ozuipa purchased 10kg of meat and started to prepare pelmeni (a meat-filled boiled dumpling) at home. Selling pelmeni, she earns about 5,000 soms to meet the family needs. This profit made it possible to purchase a fridge for her home to improve their living conditions. With money received from the loan, Ozuipa wants to purchase a sheep to slaughter. In the future, she wants to see her son get married.\r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

is Arcelita, 44, a resident of Tanza, Cavite City, Philippines. Her husband is Renato, an overseas contract worker. She is a mother to her three children. Two are already studying in elementary school and one is still staying at home. She, together with her children, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nArcelita operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Aside from this, she sells mineral water for added income. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 250 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 11,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products needed in her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nArcelita hopes her business will be stable and dreams of giving her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work in her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":884564,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To pay for grocery items and products to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Tanza, Cavite","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-10-06T20:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Arcelita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":11000,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":458.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":458.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":458.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":458.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":458.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":458.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":458.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":458.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":458.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":458.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":458.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":458.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":458.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":458.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":458.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":458.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":458.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":458.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":458.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":458.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":458.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":458.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":458.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":458.41}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.45},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.45},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.45},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.45},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":103.12,"local_amount":4124.97,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:37:17Z","rounded_local_amount":4487.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238571832,"comment":null},{"amount":45.84,"local_amount":1833.03,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:31:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1994.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244529382,"comment":null},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":1834,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:39:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1995.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250738598,"comment":null},{"amount":57.29,"local_amount":2291,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:48:26Z","rounded_local_amount":2492.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257145834,"comment":null},{"amount":22.92,"local_amount":917,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:01:27Z","rounded_local_amount":997.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263274838,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-10-14T07:26:29Z","paid_date":"2012-03-15T09:01:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":341720,"name":"Vergie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Vergie is 38 years old, married and blessed with two school-aged children.

In order to find a financial support source for her family, Elmira started her own animal husbandry business in 1991, using a starting capital of 35,000 som (KGS).  Successfully working in the animal husbandry field and having an income from sales of milk products, Elmira also grows cereal crops on a 1.16 hectare plot of land, which allows her to provide fodder for her livestock and have an additional income from the sale of fodder.  In order to further develop her business, Elmira requested a loan in the sum of 55,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai Tushum and Partners\" company to buy bulls.

She buys her stock in various communities surrounding Sikasso, and then sells the merchandise wholesale or at retail to a clientele consisting mostly of household heads.\r\n\r\nShe hopes that this loan will help her earn a monthly profit of 275,000 FCFA, which she will use primarily to increase her working capital, help with the household expenses, and pay the interest on the loan.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":583.33,"image":{"id":884699,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","use":"to stock up on grain for resale ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2011-10-06T00:03:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Salimata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":55555.56},{"due_date":"2011-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":55555.56},{"due_date":"2011-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":55555.56},{"due_date":"2012-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":55555.56},{"due_date":"2012-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":55555.56},{"due_date":"2012-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":55555.56},{"due_date":"2012-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":55555.56},{"due_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":55555.56},{"due_date":"2012-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":55555.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.66},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.66},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.66},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":55555.56,"processed_date":"2011-10-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T11:23:04Z","rounded_local_amount":56400.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238699275,"comment":null},{"amount":116.66,"local_amount":55555.56,"processed_date":"2011-11-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T11:12:19Z","rounded_local_amount":56400.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244655551,"comment":null},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":55555.56,"processed_date":"2011-12-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T11:22:43Z","rounded_local_amount":56400.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250874343,"comment":null},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":55555.56,"processed_date":"2012-01-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:47:58Z","rounded_local_amount":56400.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257283164,"comment":null},{"amount":116.66,"local_amount":55555.56,"processed_date":"2012-02-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T11:00:32Z","rounded_local_amount":56400.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263424673,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-10-11T22:17:02Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":341811,"name":"Ruth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ruth is hard working.

He is currently on his fourth individual loan, the previous loans have all been fully repaid. \r\n\r\nThis fourth loan will allow him to buy 6 new clippers, 8 sets of brushes and combs, 6 barrels of bleach, 6 bottles of 90\u00b0 alcohol, 6 boxes of deodorants, 15 boxes of Pharmapure soap, 2 dozen assorted perfumes and 2 boxes of Timor  insecticide. Ibrahima buys his supplies in Bamako (Mali's capital) for use in his salon located along the R.N. 7 main road. His customers are mostly young people.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, he expects to make a monthly profit of 240,000 CFA francs. With the  profit he makes, he plans to be able to meet most of his own and his family's expenses, pay the interest on the loan and invest the rest in his business."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":420,"image":{"id":884712,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","use":"to buy supplies for his salon.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2011-10-06T00:03:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ibrahima ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2012-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2012-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2012-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2012-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":210},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":210},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":210},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":210},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":210}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":210,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2011-11-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T11:12:26Z","rounded_local_amount":101521.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244655552,"comment":null},{"amount":210,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2012-01-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:48:05Z","rounded_local_amount":101521.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257283165,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-10-16T01:22:03Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":341818,"name":"Fatu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fatu is 43 years old and lives in the airport community.

The members of the group decided to name it that because the area where they live is at the top of a hill and from there you can see a beautiful wooded landscape where the frost does not harm the trees. The group has existed before but the clients were in arrears and had many problems. Today all of them are new members to the group, except for Carlos S. who\u2019s been in the group since the first loan. \r\n\r\nJuan has been the representative of the group. He\u2019s been married for 39 years, and he\u2019s been married to Lorenza for 27 years. Together they have had four children, Eduardo who is 12 and in secondary school, Anayeli who is 9 and in primary school, Wendy who is 7 and in the second year of secondary school, and Juan who is the youngest at 5 years old and in preschool. \r\n\r\nJuan raises sheep and later sells them with they are grown. He has been in this business for 28 years. Now he doesn\u2019t have any problem since he cares for them very well and he takes them to the veterinarian if they are sick. Now he has asked for a loan to buy two sheep he had at home but later sold, and now he will start again.

is a 42 year-old woman living in the town of Yen Phong distict - Bac Ninh province.  She is married and has three school-aged children.  To making a living, Lam owns and operates a furniture making business.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from making and selling general household furniture to local businesses and community members.  Lam has been engaged in this business for over two years and earns approximately 4.500.000 VND a months.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Lam joined Kiva partner SEDA in order to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Lam has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8.736.000 VND from SEDA.  This previous loan was used to purchase additional raw materials to expand product offerings.  Lam is now requesting a new loan of 9.184.000 VND which will be used to purchase machinery to expand the business.  The loan will be the 5th loan taken out by the borrower from SEDA.  Lam plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout SEDA:\r\n\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to the low income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the Northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.
