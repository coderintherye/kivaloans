Her education was abruptly ended in secondary school because of lack of support. She then left to stay with an aunt, whose business she helped out with. This aunt sent her to a sewing apprenticeship. Currently married and the mother of one (01) child, she runs her dressmaking business wth great difficulty because she does not have the necessary material, and her unemployed husband is also unable to help her. The only sewing machine she uses was lent to her by a friend. Based on the quality of her work, she is increasingly asked for by an insistent clientele whom she is unable to satisfy in time. This situation risks creating a crisis of confidence among her customers unless she can quickly equip herself better.\r\n\r\n<p>Thus, she is asking for a loan of $950 which will allow her to open a shop and to acquire 3 sewing machines in order to serve her clientele more quickly and facilitate the training of her two (02) apprentices.

It has always been hard to meet the needs of a big family in Ukraine. To provide for their family, Igor and Marina decided to start their own small business selling jean clothing for children.\r\n\r\nLoans from \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d have helped Igor and Marina purchase a kiosk in the market and expand their clothing sales business. Through persistence, hard work, and further loans the couple have had the opportunity to start another business selling sinks, faucets, pipes, and heaters. Igor\u2019s natural talent as a technician make him a good entrepreneur in the area of  heating system sales, installation, and warranty service. \r\n\r\nIgor and Marina would like a loan to purchase heaters, boilers, and related plumbing equipment. Most smaller towns in Ukraine have heat and hot running water only in the winter season \u2013 about  a three month period. Good quality boilers, heating systems, and plastic pipes will always be in high demand. This loan will not only help Igor and Marina\u2019s business grow, but it will also help meet the needs of their community, bringing warmth and comfort to many homes.

Having been born to a poor family, she left school to help her mother with the household duties. After having spent several years at home, her parents sent her on an apprenticeship to learn to sew. She then specialized in making baby clothing. At the end of her apprenticeship, she was unable to open a workshop and thus had to resort to sales. Then with the little savings she had, along with a small loan, she opened a workshop and a store that she still operates today.<p>\r\n\r\nThe baby clothing that she sells in her store is made by Ms. M. and her apprentices. Faced with the ever-growing demand of her customers and insufficient financial means, she is requesting a loan of $1100. This loan will allow her to order cloth wholesale to make baby clothing, which will increase her production capacity, and to buy other baby articles requested by her customers, such as sheets, diapers, and other items.

Plus tard, il a voulu apprendre un m\u00e9tier et a choisi la cordonnerie qui peut bien lui r\u00e9ussir aujourd\u2019hui s\u2019il disposait plus de moyens. Mari\u00e9 et p\u00e8re d\u2019un (01) enfant avec deux (02) apprentis \u00e0 charge, ce jeune gar\u00e7on a une parfaite ma\u00eetrise de son m\u00e9tier qu\u2019il exerce avec enthousiasme et abn\u00e9gation.

and Natasha T. are a husband and wife team. They both worked at a factory in the past, however their salaries were too small to provide for the needs of their family. For that reason they decided to start their own small business selling clothing for teens and youth. \r\n\r\nVitalyi and Natasha got their first loan from Nadiya Ukraine in March 2004. At that time they had only one vending stall in an open-air market. Lending services helped the couple purchase four kiosks and hire two employees who work as vendors. The active involvement of both spouses in this business is one reason for its success. Not long ago Vitalyi was in a bad car accident. He had serious injuries and was hospitalized for more than three months. Natasha was the only breadwinner in the family during that time. She had to run their business and learn to manage it efficiently without her husband. The business has not only remained stable but has seen considerable growth since that time. \r\n\r\nVitalyi and Natasha are requesting a loan to expand their assortment of clothing for young people. They are planning to purchase trendy jeans, sweaters, blouses, pullovers, skirts and pants that will sell really well. Good taste and the ability to keep up with fashion guarantee high demand for the clothes Vitalyi and Natasha can offer.  Their flexibility, loyalty, and ability to handle challenges are some of the reasons this couple will continue to see success in their business.\r\n \r\n<p>

The quality of her product has earned her a large customer base because good women come from Lom\u00e9 to buy her gari.  But without enough money, her production of gari is very limited, and her customers are increasingly disappointed.  She is now dealing with a strong demand that she cannot meet.  Making gari is difficult, given the high risk of injury, particularly when grating the cassava root by hand.

D. has been a widow for five years.  Her deceased husband left her with three children that she supports in addition to her parents.  To feed her family, she started a business selling common chickens.  She is especially courageous and worries about making sure her children are educated.  So she works tirelessly going from village to village to look for chickens to sell back in town.  But since family expenses have grown more and more onerous, Ms. D. just cannot go any further.  And so she is asking for help to improve her business.  Her skill and honesty has resulted in more business than she can handle.  She is therefore requesting a loan of $850 to enlarge her chicken coop and to serve as capital to do trade in chickens.  The profits gained from this activity will allow her to provide for her orphaned children.  She will also be able to save more money to improve her financial situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from French by Daniel Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<b><p>\r\n\r\n\r\nMadame D.

This loan will have a positive effect on her financial situation, and she will thus be better able to take care of her children.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from French by Kristina Jackson, Kiva Volunteer.<p><\/b>\r\n\r\nMadame A. Akofala est une jeune femme mari\u00e9e et m\u00e8re de quatre (4) enfants. Son \u00e2ge lui conf\u00e8re un dynamisme dans son activit\u00e9. Femme dynamique et endurante, elle a une passion pour la production de l\u2019huile de coco, activit\u00e9 qu\u2019elle exerce depuis longtemps. Le revenu qu\u2019elle en tire quoique insignifiant lui permet de contribuer largement aux charges du m\u00e9nage. L\u2019\u00e9levage traditionnel des volailles que son mari fait ne suffit pas pour couvrir les besoins de la famille. Les charges de la famille devenant de plus en plus lourdes, Madame A. veut augmenter sa production d\u2019huile de coco et am\u00e9liorer ainsi son revenu. La qualit\u00e9 de son produit est tr\u00e8s appr\u00e9ci\u00e9e sur le march\u00e9, ce qui fait que la demande est forte. Elle sollicite un cr\u00e9dit de $800 pour acheter plus de coco et de mat\u00e9riel de production pour augmenter son rendement. Comme impact, ce cr\u00e9dit aura une r\u00e9percussion positive sur son \u00e9conomie. Elle pourra \u00e0 cet effet mieux prendre soin de ses enfants.

runs a small business selling sportswear for men and women. She is married with one son. A Technical school graduate, Marina had previously worked in a factory. However, her salary was too small to provide for the needs of the family and she was forced to seek other opportunities to earn a living.\r\n\r\nMarina has been in the clothing business for over 4 years and has repaid 19 loans to \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d without any delinquencies. Her diligent, hard work has helped her succeed in business and maintain loyal clientele. \r\n\r\nMarina would like to receive a loan for $800 to serve as working capital in her business. Financial assistance will help her purchase an assortment of T-shirts, jackets, vests, and knitted wear. High-quality, durable, and comfortable sportswear will sell really well and will help Marina\u2019s business grow \u2013 especially in this cold winter season.

M. is married with two grown children. Her son is in college and her daughter helps her with her business. Ludmila\u2019s husband is disabled and is not able to work. She is the only breadwinner in the family. \r\n\r\nLudmila used some of her savings to start a small business selling women\u2019s lingerie. She was able to purchase a small kiosk located in one of the local markets in busy downtown.  Her polite manner and rich experience have helped her operate her business successfully. Over time she has gotten to know the preferences and tastes of her customers making her kiosk a popular stop when they visit the market. Her daughter\u2019s active participation in the business has also added greatly to its success. \r\n\r\nTo meet growing demand from her customers, Ludmila is requesting a loan for $1000 which will allow her to purchase more underwear at wholesale prices. Increased selling capacity will not only meet the needs of her clients, but the additional profits generated will meet another of Ludmilla\u2019s goals \u2013 to help pay for her son\u2019s college tuition. This loan will allow her to increase her income and provide the necessary funds to pay for her son\u2019s education which she considers her most valuable investment.

S\u00e8l\u00e9t\u00e9 Pauline is a mother of five (5) children. A widow for several months, she now has the burden of taking care of her entire family alone.\r\n<p> \r\nTo meet her family's financial needs, she has been storing and selling the vegetable \"gari\" and corn flour for the last 5 years. This very profitable activity has enabled her to contribute to household needs until the death of her husband. Today, faced with her new situation, Mrs G. cannot make ends meet with her business. Concerned with the education of her children, she would like to build on her business but does not have the necessary means. Her experience and management skills enabled her to refund her first two loans promptly. The new credit of $650 that she is requesting will be used for the purchase, the storage and the resale of gari and corn. The improvement of her business will enable her to improve the quality of life of her family.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from French by Ivana Kostic, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nN\u00e9e en 1965 \u00e0 Kp\u00e9m\u00e9 (Pr\u00e9fecture des Lacs), Madame G.

Pour leurs besoins et les probl\u00e8mes financiers de sa famille, elle exerce depuis 5 ans le stockage et la vente de la farine de manioc \u00ab gari \u00bb et du ma\u00efs. Cette activit\u00e9 tr\u00e8s rentable lui a toujours permis de contribuer efficacement aux charges du m\u00e9nage jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la mort de son mari. Aujourd\u2019hui seule face \u00e0 ses charges, Madame G. n\u2019a plus la capacit\u00e9 de les assumer. Soucieuse de l\u2019\u00e9ducation de ses enfants, elle cherche \u00e0 renforcer son activit\u00e9 mais il n\u2019a pas assez de moyens.

Having noticed that frozen goods are unavailable in her district, Mrs M. surveyed people in the area to assess their need for these goods. Thanks to her first credit of $400, she managed to buy a freezer and began selling frozen products. This activity quickly became sucessful since Mrs M. is the only business selling these products in the vicinity. Dynamic and honest, she already refunded her first credit. However, her product supply does not meet the demand. To improve her business in this regard, she is asking for a credit of $850 to be able to buy a new freezer for the wholesale of the frozen products.

For the last 8 years, she has run a business fabricating and selling mats. The business of mat making is booming in her town. It is because of this that she is able to contribute to the running of her household. Three months ago, she began making woven baskets because she realized that this would also be profitable. The demand for these baskets has been very strong and they need to been made in large quantities to meet the demand - particularly from tomato producers. To suitably meet the demand of people wanting to buy her baskets, Mrs A. needs some financial support. She is asking for a loan of $700, which she will use as business capital to buy raw materials needed to make mats and baskets. This will increase her income and improve living conditions for her and her family.  \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from French by Susan Bell, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nN\u00e9e en 1965, Madame A.

Just recently, Yelena was able to purchase a stand in the busiest market in the city. \r\n\r\nYelena is requesting a loan of $1,200 for several purposes. She\u2019d like to increase her turnover capital, purchase additional merchandise, and buy a new refrigerator to store perishable food items. Fresh dairy products, canned corn, peas, fruit and quality vegetable oil are just some of the many items Yelana beautifully arranges on her stand to attract customers in the busy market. The ability to purchase more items and get a new refrigerator to keep groceries fresh will help Yelena meet the high demand for these food items. Increased business income will generate more funds to help pay for her son\u2019s college tuition and continue to secure her family\u2019s well-being. \r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\u041e\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0430
