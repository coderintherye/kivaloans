Israa' is a conservative woman, so her husband\u2019s photograph, taken in his workshop, appears here.  Her husband earns a decent income and also works in the agriculture sector. \r\n\r\nIsraa\u2019 is requesting a loan to purchase a new blacksmith kit and iron for her husband so that he may improve his business. She needs to take a loan from FATEN that she will repay on a monthly basis. Her loan will positively impact her husband\u2019s work and increase his income which will enable him to provide a better standard of living for their family. \r\n\r\n\r\nAbout this loan:\r\n\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee.

A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

Her husband is a Palestinian National Authority employee with a decent salary. He is also a taxi driver. \n\nInshirah wants to help her husband repair and paint the taxi, but the amount of money she has isn't enough. So, she needs to take a loan from FATEN. When Inshirah gets the loan, she will be able to help her husband repair and paint the taxi. This will improve the taxi's condition and enable her husband to work extra hours to increase the family's income which in turn will improve the family's living conditions. Inshirah is a conservative woman, so her husband is photographed next to the taxi the family owns.\n\n\nAbout this loan product:\n\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

He currently employs three people to help him. Charles is the last person on the left side of the picture.\r\n\r\nCharles and his team have requested a Kiva loan via Vision Finance Company in order to cultivate more Irish potatoes to sell.

is 47-year-old Foday. He is married and has four children, aged 19, 16, 15 and 13 years. In 1986, Foday established his used-clothing business. He began his business after moving from Kono (where mining is the main economic activity) to Makeni (where petty trading is the main business activity). \r\n\r\nWorking seven days a week and 11 hours a day, he earns about 1,200,000 Sierra Leone leones (Le) every month from this business. He would like a loan in the amount of Le 5,000,000. Foday has already received and successfully repaid one loan, and now requires a new loan in order to buy used clothing: T-shirts (two bales @ Le550,000), ladies blouses (two bales @ Le700,000), skirts (two bales @ Le650,000) and jeans jackets (one bale @ Le1,200,000). \r\n\r\nHe hopes that this loan will enable him to increase his monthly profits by approximately Le 300,000. In the future, Foday plans to open a big shop and an account for his old age. He is excited and hopes to finish his building and educate his children. Competition is keen but he usually buys good products that meet his customers' demands.   \r\n\r\nHe is assisted by his family members, and he serves 50 customers per day because of his quality stock.  He travels to Freetown to buy his business stock by public transport. He is hardworking and honest. He thanks you for your support.  \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":875239,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used

He began his business when he completed his certificate in Mental Health Counseling. As a health worker, he thought it wise to be dealing in essential drugs since in his area there is no drugstore. Working 7 days a week and 13 hours a day, he earns about Le 1,000,000 every month from this business. He would like a loan of Le 3,000,000. Saidu Alie requires a loan in order to buy Amoxicillin syrup - 1  box @ Le 500,000, Dexorange syrup - 10 bottles @ Le 100,000, mebendazole - 24 boxes @ Le 40,000, peak milk tins - 2 cartons @ Le 140,000, and cornflakes - 4 cartons @ Le 90,000. He hopes that this loan will enable him to increase his monthly profits by approximately Le 400,000. In the future, Saidu Alie plans to open another pharmacy and provision shop.  He is very excited and ready to battle to the top, he said. He wants his children to attain a higher learning certificate. Saidu Alie is assisted by his wife. He usually gets his goods from his supplier in Freetown twice a month and sometimes thrice, depending on the sales.  He always travels by public vehicle.

A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan. \r\n\r\nFor more information on lending in the Muslim world, please visit Kiva's Muslim World Lending helptext: http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/3aekx8m.\r\n \r\n\r\n "}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400.01,"image":{"id":887978,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","use":"to repair and paint a taxi.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PS","country":"Palestine","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"31.92157 35.203285","type":"point"}},"partner_id":80,"posted_date":"2011-10-10T16:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Khadeja","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1183.12,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":66},{"due_date":"2011-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":66},{"due_date":"2012-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":66},{"due_date":"2012-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":66},{"due_date":"2012-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":66},{"due_date":"2012-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":66},{"due_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":66},{"due_date":"2012-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":66},{"due_date":"2012-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":66},{"due_date":"2012-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":66},{"due_date":"2012-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":66},{"due_date":"2012-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":66},{"due_date":"2012-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":66},{"due_date":"2012-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":66},{"due_date":"2013-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":66},{"due_date":"2013-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":66},{"due_date":"2013-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":66},{"due_date":"2013-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":61.12}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.94},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.94},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.94},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.95},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.94},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.94},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.94},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.94},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.94},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.95},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.94},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.94},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.94},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.94},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.94},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.95},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.94},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.99}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":65.73,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T11:03:26Z","rounded_local_amount":66.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244646901,"comment":null},{"amount":333.34,"local_amount":328.65,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T11:12:17Z","rounded_local_amount":333.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250863937,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-11-11T12:07:30Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":343031,"name":"Chinara's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Chinara is the leader of this group.
