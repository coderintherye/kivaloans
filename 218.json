The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":319882,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase cereals in bulk for her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-05-15T22:10:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2010-05-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:05:57Z","rounded_local_amount":503062.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144773296,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-05-16T01:02:01Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:05:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":108652,"name":"Rose","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Rose A. est revendeuse des l\u00e9gumes au march\u00e9 d\u2019Avetonou, un village situ\u00e9 \u00e0 environ 100 kilom\u00e8tres de Lom\u00e9.

years ago, Mary K. got her first loan from Sudan Microfinance. That was when she started a business selling charcoal in small quantities. Her business nearly failed due to the demolition of her house which was in the way of a new road. Nevertheless, she fully repaid her loan to Sudan Microfinance. \r\n\r\nMary has now joined the Kiva field partner, Brac South Sudan. She sells charcoal wholesale at her store and wants a loan to hire a lorry for the transportation of charcoal from the producers to her store.  Mary is thirty-two years old and married to a businessman. She has three children who all attend school, and with the extra profits from her loan, she hopes to be able to pay school fees for her children. \r\n\r\nBRAC's holistic approach to poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor encompasses a range of core programs in economic and social development, health, education, human rights and legal services, which are delivered through an extensive network of village organizations. BRAC has become one of the world's largest NGOs as measured by the scale and diversity of its interventions.  In 2007, BRAC started operations in Southern Sudan. The microfinance program, which is targeted toward returning war refugees, has already formed 418 village organizations with more than 14,000 women members.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":319886,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Charcoal Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"Hire

Their main business involves growing peanuts and beans. \r\n\r\nConcerned about making their plantations profitable, the group members decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso loan program four years ago.  After having correctly repaid the three preceding loans, they are on their fourth farming loan.  The current loan will be used to buy sacks of seeds to plant peanuts and beans and also to buy minor supplies and equipment for farming, exclusively at the grand marketplace of Koutiala City.  Following the off-season, the harvests are stored for a certain time, so that they gain value.  And then they are sold at the grand marketplace of Koutiala and in surrounding marketplaces at the retail level (often wholesale), in cash transactions and on credit in a few rare instances.  Customers come generally from large cities. \r\n\r\nAfter selling their agricultural products, the group members each intend to realize a profit of 50,000 that will be use to repay the loan and to cover common family expenses. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":319890,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy fertilizers, seeds, equipment, and supplies ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:23Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bintou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Minata Issa     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sanata           ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Minata Adama ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Habi             ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Koro ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadia Dra ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Makoura ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gn\u00e9r\u00e9ba   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":575000,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":575000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1200,"local_amount":575000,"processed_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:36:03Z","rounded_local_amount":577403.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118152083,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-06-02T09:42:34Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T12:36:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":108657,"name":"Aku","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Aku N. est une femme de 47 ans, mari\u00e9e et m\u00e8re de 3 enfants. elle est revendeuse de pains \u00e0 Avetonou, un village situ\u00e9 \u00e0 environ 100 kilom\u00e8tres de Lom\u00e9, la capitale togolaise.

(Greetings!) from Tanzania!  This is  Lwiza M. from Mbeya. She is 43 years old, and married  with 5 children between the ages of 15 and 25.\r\n\r\nLwiza, an orphan, has been running a genge business since 1995. A genge (grocery store) is typically a very basic structure made of wood, with a tin roof, which sells general items such as onions, tomatoes, chili, oil, rice, and dried fish. It is the kind of place local people send their children running to fetch something when they are in the middle of cooking the evening meal, and don\u2019t have time to go all the way to the market to buy the missing ingredient.\r\n\r\nLwiza works at the business for 9 to 12 hours per day, 6 days a week.  Lwiza currently earns about $80 a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of $300 in order to purchase items in bulk for her business. In the future, she plans to open a new business. \r\n\r\nLwiza thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania, through micro-leasing. The organization supports the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":319906,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase items in bulk for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-05-15T23:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lwiza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":400000,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":400000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":300,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:45:36Z","rounded_local_amount":402450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103868012,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-05-16T01:22:20Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T14:45:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":108672,"name":"Rebecca","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rebecca M. is married with 4 dependents.

This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

The group finances itself through an internal dues system but with the loan from IMCEC, it finds greater financial input and a short term for the financing of their businesses. Most of the women have little stands in the central open-air market of the town of Thies where they sell vegetables, fish, jewelry, cloth, etc.    <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":319930,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"purchase of local products in the rural weekly markets and fishing areas for resale in town","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"THIES","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.783333 -16.966667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":108,"posted_date":"2009-05-17T14:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Th\u00e9r\u00e8se","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Oumy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aminata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Venise","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":175,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T04:28:13Z","rounded_local_amount":84204.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53038089,"comment":null},{"amount":175,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-07-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T20:52:00Z","rounded_local_amount":84204.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63262203,"comment":null},{"amount":175,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-08-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-21T10:56:02Z","rounded_local_amount":84204.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73703185,"comment":null},{"amount":175,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-29T12:02:16Z","rounded_local_amount":84204.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87132771,"comment":null},{"amount":175,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T08:33:04Z","rounded_local_amount":84204.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97047038,"comment":null},{"amount":175,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2009-11-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T15:19:09Z","rounded_local_amount":84204.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103892584,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-05-20T12:19:05Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T15:19:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":108691,"name":"Koffi","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Koffi A. est un jeune homme de 38 ans, mari\u00e9 et p\u00e8re de 2 enfants. il est conducteur de taxi moto \u00e0 Wome.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback micro-finance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback micro-finance facility.

This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

Julienne is married to Nounangnon Djotchou, a fisherman by profession. Julienne is the mother of six children, but only two of them are still in her care. Julienne never went to school. Julienne was raised by her paternal grandmother, for whom she sold maize paste and fried fish. Maize paste, locally known as \"akassa\", accompanied by spices and fried fish, is a meal consumed by many Beninese.

Her efforts in her general store these past 12 years have brought great benefits because her determination has helped her business become the most frequented one in the locality because of her good customer service and because she is always at her customers\u2019 disposal. She opens her doors from six in the morning until midnight to meet customer demand. She has fulfilled this shift on her own for years, but she now has the support of her children, who are now older and wish to support their mother in order to lighten her workload. Nevertheless, Ana still has many projects to accomplish, the most desirable of which is expanding her business space because there is a great variety of merchandise that she cannot sell because of the limited display space.

In the afternoons, she exhibits her precious decorations in her house, trying always to be ready if called to decorate a reception hall since sometimes events are unpredictable.  Likewise, she is always aware of current trends and latest changes in design, and she tries to specialize in her craft by taking classes in this area.  All of this sacrifice is aimed to help her open a store with two friends, who have the same desire to provide a diverse range of decorations for the home and they hope to create a large enterprise in the future.  This is her fourteenth loan with MFP and, since she became part of this group, she has tried to participate with her colleagues who are very dedicated to the development of the cooperative bank.  The 1000 soles that she requests will serve to acquire some materials so she can continue making her decorations and grow her income.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":320053,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Decorations Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase materials to make her decorations.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-05-19T12:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eduarda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":150.68},{"due_date":"2009-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":154.63},{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":161.83},{"due_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":170.17},{"due_date":"2009-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":177.28},{"due_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":185.41}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.74},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.12},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.64},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.56},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.05},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.89}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":52.74,"local_amount":150.68,"processed_date":"2009-05-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:56:13Z","rounded_local_amount":160.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44596251,"comment":null},{"amount":54.12,"local_amount":154.63,"processed_date":"2009-06-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:42:43Z","rounded_local_amount":164.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990529,"comment":null},{"amount":56.64,"local_amount":161.83,"processed_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:43:42Z","rounded_local_amount":171.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211640,"comment":null},{"amount":59.56,"local_amount":170.17,"processed_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:25:59Z","rounded_local_amount":180.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641161,"comment":null},{"amount":62.05,"local_amount":177.28,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:42:23Z","rounded_local_amount":188.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080601,"comment":null},{"amount":64.89,"local_amount":185.41,"processed_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:10:24Z","rounded_local_amount":196.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996726,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-05-19T14:06:58Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T03:10:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":108776,"name":"Olufunke","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Olufunke O., 58 years old, is married with four children.

Together with her family, she has lived for the past 15 years in the house that she and her husband were able to acquire together.  Shortly after their wedding, she opened a store in their house, which has grown more successful over the years. Beginning only by selling basic staple products, today she has installed a book store section in a part of her store, in which she displays folders and other school items.  Her success is the result of the work that she carries out every day from 6 in the morning to 7 at night, time during which she must attend to both her customers and her family.  None the less, the space that she has is very small and is in need of some repairs, so she wishes in the future to install a proper storefront.  Doing so would enable her to increase her sales and offer products to her neighborhood that, for the most part, are difficult to obtain on account of the far distance of the markets and malls.  This is her thirteenth loan with MFP.  She has been with the group for approximately 7 years, during which time they have helped her to improve her position both socially and with regard to her business.

With his previous five loans, Hector has shown himself to be reponsable with repayments; he has an excellent credit history. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Cynthia McMurry, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":320131,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"Buy zinc for new roof","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Chontales","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.083333 -85.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2009-05-20T23:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hector Francisco","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":7000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":636.36},{"due_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":636.36},{"due_date":"2009-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":636.36},{"due_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":636.36},{"due_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":636.36},{"due_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":636.36},{"due_date":"2009-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":636.36},{"due_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":636.36},{"due_date":"2010-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":636.36},{"due_date":"2010-03-13T08:00:00Z","amount":636.36},{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":636.4}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.09},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.09},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.09},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.09},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.09},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.09},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.09},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.09},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.09},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.09},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.1}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":34.09,"local_amount":636.36,"processed_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T16:26:49Z","rounded_local_amount":651.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52890927,"comment":null},{"amount":34.09,"local_amount":636.36,"processed_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T09:34:48Z","rounded_local_amount":651.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63112243,"comment":null},{"amount":34.09,"local_amount":636.36,"processed_date":"2009-08-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T09:42:52Z","rounded_local_amount":651.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73533647,"comment":null},{"amount":34.09,"local_amount":636.36,"processed_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T09:49:52Z","rounded_local_amount":651.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86965005,"comment":null},{"amount":34.09,"local_amount":636.36,"processed_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T10:39:56Z","rounded_local_amount":651.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96875461,"comment":null},{"amount":34.09,"local_amount":636.36,"processed_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T10:45:23Z","rounded_local_amount":651.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103713389,"comment":null},{"amount":34.09,"local_amount":636.36,"processed_date":"2009-12-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T10:55:36Z","rounded_local_amount":651.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110601088,"comment":null},{"amount":34.09,"local_amount":636.36,"processed_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T09:51:31Z","rounded_local_amount":651.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118002561,"comment":null},{"amount":34.09,"local_amount":636.36,"processed_date":"2010-02-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T07:52:21Z","rounded_local_amount":651.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123840726,"comment":null},{"amount":34.09,"local_amount":636.36,"processed_date":"2010-03-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T07:49:13Z","rounded_local_amount":651.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128873661,"comment":null},{"amount":34.1,"local_amount":636.4,"processed_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:29:39Z","rounded_local_amount":651.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136603660,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-05-21T00:49:09Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T09:29:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":108834,"name":"Koessi","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Koessi T. est conducteur de taxi moto \u00e0 Wome.

If they sold enough products properly they could take advantage of purchasing offers to later resell the goods at normal price.\r\n\r\nWorking and homemaking at once was a task that Mery couldn't initially accomplish, but over time she became accustomed to her different roles. Thanks to her husband's support her obligations have lessened since they take turns in finishing household chores. Both are currently thinking of opening a bazaar in their home with the goal of improving their financial status and providing their children with the necessary money for their college studies. This is Mery's eighth loan with MFP; alongside her loan group colleagues she learned to assume many challenges and responsibilities and all of them are very timely and orderly with their loan payments. With this 2000-sole loan she will buy more wholesale beauty products to sell at a higher price.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Shanti Singh, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":320224,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"Buy wholesale merchandise to increase sales","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-05-21T04:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mery","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":675}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:01:18Z","rounded_local_amount":341.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44596264,"comment":null},{"amount":117,"local_amount":346.66,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:45:07Z","rounded_local_amount":355.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990542,"comment":null},{"amount":120.98,"local_amount":358.46,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:46:40Z","rounded_local_amount":367.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211653,"comment":null},{"amount":127.08,"local_amount":376.54,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:29:29Z","rounded_local_amount":385.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641174,"comment":null},{"amount":131.63,"local_amount":390.01,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:43:05Z","rounded_local_amount":399.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080614,"comment":null},{"amount":65.81,"local_amount":195,"processed_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:11:47Z","rounded_local_amount":199.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996739,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-05-21T20:20:06Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T03:11:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":108869,"name":"Nancy","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Nancy es una trabajadora madre de familia, el esfuerzo que realiza est\u00e1 basado en las ganas de progresar y educar a sus hijos, a quienes siempre  trata de cuidar y proteger.

This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

She works at the business for 9-12 hours per day, six days per week and currently earns about $120 a month.\r\n\r\nRahimata is requesting a loan in order to purchase crops in bulk for her business. In the future, she plans to open a new business.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":320389,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase crops in bulk for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-05-16T19:20:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rahimata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":700000,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":700000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":525}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":525,"local_amount":700000,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:05:59Z","rounded_local_amount":704287.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144773305,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-05-18T03:08:21Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:05:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":108926,"name":"Bozorgul","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0425\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0438\u0435\u0437\u043e\u0432 \u0411\u043e\u0437\u043e\u0440\u0433\u0443\u043b \u0416\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0442 \u0432 \u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u0435 \u0425\u0443\u0440\u043e\u0441\u043e\u043d. \u0412\u043e\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0442 35 \u043b\u0435\u0442. \u0416\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0442, \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 3 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u0411\u043e\u0437\u043e\u0440\u0433\u0443\u043b \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043a\u0443\u043f\u043b\u044f, \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0436\u0435\u0439 \u043a\u0440\u0443\u043f\u043d\u043e \u0440\u043e\u0433\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0442\u0430. \u042d\u0442\u0438\u043c \u0432\u0438\u0434\u043e\u043c \u0431\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0435 10 \u043b\u0435\u0442. \u042d\u0442\u043e\u0442 \u0431\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441 \u044f\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043e\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043d\u044b\u043c \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043c \u0434\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0430, \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0441\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0441\u0435\u043c\u044c\u0438. \u041f\u043e\u044d\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u043a\u043b\u0438\u0435\u043d\u0442 \u0445\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0442 \u0432\u0437\u044f\u0442\u044c \u0443 \u043d\u0430\u0441 \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0438 \u043a\u0443\u043f\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043d\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u0431\u044b\u0447\u043a\u043e\u0432.","en":"H.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, so they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that is allows clients to use their equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":320428,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"To purchase clothes in bulk for her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-05-16T20:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tusajigwe ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":400000,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":400000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":300,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:05:58Z","rounded_local_amount":402450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144773310,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-05-16T22:38:37Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:05:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":108939,"name":"Berta Maria","description":{"languages":["pt","en"],"texts":{"pt":"Berta Maria D. \u00e9 natural de Maputo, tem 53 anos de idade, divorciada e m\u00e3e de 5 filhos onde o mais velho tem 35 anos e o mais novo 24 anos de idade respectivamente, todos j\u00e1 n\u00e3o estudam e os tr\u00eas primeiros est\u00e3o a viver nas suas casas.\n\nBerta estudou at\u00e9 6\u00aaclasse e parou por falta de condi\u00e7\u00f5es financeiras na fam\u00edlia, a 5 anos que o marido foi na terra do rand e nunca voltou, a tr\u00eas anos decide iniciar negocio que consiste na compra e venda de capulanas, deste negocio tem um rendimento mensal de 12000,00mt.\n\nBerta solicita empr\u00e9stimo na Hluvuku e no Kiva pela primeira vez, com qual pretende aumentar o seu volumen de negocio, futuramente Berta pretende comprar outro talh\u00e3o afim de construir casas para aluguer de quartos e conta com ajuda do credito. \n","en":"Berta Maria D. is a native of Maptuo.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback micro-finance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, so they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that it allows clients to use their equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":320436,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"To increase production.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-05-16T21:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Uyuni ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":700000,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":700000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":525}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":525,"local_amount":700000,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:05:59Z","rounded_local_amount":701137.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144773311,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-05-17T03:41:13Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:05:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":108942,"name":"M\/wa Masikini Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Khadija has been been a juice and food spices (mango picle) seller in the Mikunguni neighborhood of Zanzibar for two years.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor coverage of basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":320442,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","use":"To purchase tailoring materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-05-16T20:30:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vick","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:05:59Z","rounded_local_amount":500812.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144773312,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-05-16T21:57:00Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:05:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":108945,"name":"H\/maneno Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Halima A. has been cooking and selling food in the Mikunguni neighborhood of Zanzibar for ten years.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":320447,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase more and different items for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-05-16T20:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Victoria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":900000,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":900000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":675}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":675,"local_amount":900000,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:06:00Z","rounded_local_amount":901462.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144773313,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-05-19T18:34:05Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:06:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":108948,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":""}},"status":"refunded","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase items in bulk ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-6 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-05-16T20:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":900000,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":900000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":675}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":108949,"name":"Farajika Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Asha has been a food-seller in the Mikunguni neighborhood of Zanzibar for two years.

A grocery store is usually a very basic structure made of wood, with a tin roof, which sells general items such as onions, tomatoes, chilli, oil, rice, and dried fish. It is the kind of place local people send their children running to, to fetch something when they are in the middle of cooking the evening meal, and don\u2019t have time to go all the way to the market to buy the missing ingredient.\r\n\r\nIrene works at the business for 9-12 hours per day, seven days per week and currently earns about $120 a month.\r\n\r\nIrene is requesting a loan in order to purchase commodities in bulk for her business. In the future, she plans to open a new business. Irene thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>ABOUT SELFINA: <\/b>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":320475,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase commodities in bulk for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-05-16T21:20:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Irene ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":600000,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":600000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":450}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":450,"local_amount":600000,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:05:58Z","rounded_local_amount":600975,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144773316,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-05-17T03:26:29Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:05:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":108954,"name":"Matrida","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"For five years, Matrida has owned a small shop in the Ruaha neighborhood of Iringa.

(Greetings!) from Tanzania!

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets: thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":320481,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase crops in bulk for sale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-05-16T21:30:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mpoki","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":700000,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":700000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":525}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":525,"local_amount":700000,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:45:47Z","rounded_local_amount":701137.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103868018,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-05-17T01:07:27Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T14:45:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":108957,"name":"Happy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Happy is 26 years old, single, and has two children, ages 7 and 3.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":320486,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase of crops in bulk for re-sale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-05-16T22:30:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mary ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:05:59Z","rounded_local_amount":500812.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144773317,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-05-17T04:41:22Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:05:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":108959,"name":"Ndekeleni","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ndekeleni is married and has two children, ages 6 and 2.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":320490,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchase of commodities in bulk for re-sale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-05-16T22:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alamoka ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":800000,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":800000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":600,"local_amount":800000,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:05:59Z","rounded_local_amount":801300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144773318,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-05-19T05:09:53Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:05:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":108961,"name":"Allahverdi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Allahverdi Q. is 46 years old, married, and has 2 sons.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":320505,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase items in bulk for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-05-16T23:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Olesta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":900000,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":900000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":675}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":675,"local_amount":900000,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:05:59Z","rounded_local_amount":901462.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144773319,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-05-18T17:40:25Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:05:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":108968,"name":"Pham Thi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"H.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":320550,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase crops in bulk for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-05-17T00:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Queen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":700000,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":700000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":525}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":525,"local_amount":700000,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:05:58Z","rounded_local_amount":701137.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144773322,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-05-18T06:56:14Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:05:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":108984,"name":"Nagina M.ashiq Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nagina baji is the wife of M. and has been a citizen of Multan, Pakistan for the past 15 years.

Both children are attending the primary level of education. Fely is very thankful for having a happy family and having a good bonding with each other.\r\n\r\nAside from the passenger tricycle that her husband manages, she is also engaged in a poultry raising business. With their income from their business activities, they can provide the basic needs for their family. But she plans to expand their business in order to earn more profit to save funds for the schooling of their children. For this, she is requesting to avail a loan amounting to PHP 5,000 for both the maintenance of their motorcycle transport and her livestock raising business. She also wants to start a rice vending business to earn extra income. However, Fely said that she cannot do all of these at the same time considering the availability of funds. Thus, she is praying that her loan will be approved to be able to make her business successful. She believes that all her business plans, if pursued, will be of big help to her family. She hopes to become successful in the business by being patient and by exerting more efforts in doing her work. According to her, she will only believe that she has already achieved her goals in life when she sees her children finish their studies in college and find a better job.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":321211,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle

Two of the children are studying in elementary level while the youngest is just a seven-month-old baby. \r\n\r\nJennifer started her snack vending business when she got married while her husband has been operating their passenger tricycle, which serves as their source of income. Sometimes, they use their tricycle as their service in vending and they are gaining a net average income of 300 pesos daily. Their income is not enough to sustain the family with their daily needs and to maintain their tricycle business. For this, she is hoping to avail a loan of PHP 5,000 ($US 125) to be used in purchasing more products to sell and to be able to have a greater income for the future use of their children in school and in their home necessities. The loan will be of big help also for the maintenance of their tricycle transport business. She is happy that her husband is always supporting her by accompanying her in selling. She hopes that with the sacrifices she makes, together with her husband and with the help of our God, they could be able to support the studies of their children and meet the daily expenditures of their family. Jennifer aims for a better living and she believes that by working hard and having patience in work, her goals will be possible to attain.

is already 33 years old and married to Robert V., who is working in a furniture shop. They live peacefully in the village of Cabaruan, Naguilian, Isabela. They have been blessed with four children. The eldest is Juanito, 14 years old, he is an elementary graduate and he doesn\u2019t continue his studies because he is eager to work to earn an income. Second child is Roan, 12 years old, just graduated in elementary level and hoping to pursue her studies in high school next school year. Third is Marites, 10 years old, she is in grade five level. Youngest child is Rubelyn, 3 years old. \r\n\r\nJoan is busy in buying and selling vegetables in their village, which serves as her source of income. She has been in this kind of business for almost four years. She purchases vegetables in Cauayan City public market and sells them in their village. She has many customers but she was not able to provide for her customer\u2019s demands due to lack of funds. To have additional capital, she is requesting to avail a loan amounting to PHP 4,000 to purchase additional vegetables to sell and to maintain her vending activity. She wants to expand her vending business in order to provide her children with their needed assistance in their studies. With her vending business, she is earning an income of PHP 200 everyday. This is really of great help to sustain the needs of her family.\r\n\r\nAccording to Joan, it is better to give than to receive, especially when it is for the benefits of her children. She will do and give her very best to make her vending productive and to be able to make their living progressive, also to send her children to school and finish college course someday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":321233,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

is a 34-year-old simple businesswoman who is married to Roderick B., who works as a farmer in their village. They live peacefully in the village of Cabaruan, Naguilian, Isabela. The couple has been blessed with six children. Reymart is the eldest, 16 years old, and he is in fourth year high school, next is Rachelle who is 13 years old, third is Reymund, 12 years old, Roderick is fourth, and is 10 years old, fifth is Rovie who is 7 years old and Rhea, the youngest is only 5 months old. Marites is happy to have a big family because she has a principle in life that \u201cthe more children you have, the merrier the family is\u201d.\r\n\r\nMarites is engaged in selling different commodities that serves as her source of income. She has a small table located in front of their house where she retails her goods. Before, she was selling vegetables and barbeque but she thought of changing her vending into bread, soft drinks, food seasonings and other commodities.\r\n\r\nShe is planning to have a small store to be able to make her vending convenient and comfortable for her customers. In this regard, she is requesting a loan of PHP 5,000 to be used in buying more items to sell so that her income will increase. Thus she will be able to have funds to build her store.\r\n\r\nSo far, she is earning a net income of 200 pesos daily. She really hopes that she will have more capital to make her business grow. Marites is willing to sacrifice for the benefit of her children, especially now that her eldest will shortly enter high school.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":321245,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"To buy more

works as a gasoline retailer in their village. Most of her customers are owners of passenger tricycles. She wants to make her business grow to be able to increase her income. She plans to obtain many customers in order to earn her more profit but she doesn\u2019t have enough capital to expand her business.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, she is requesting a loan of Php 5,000. The loan proceeds will be used to purchase a larger volume of gasoline to retail and she also plans to expand her current business into a village store to further increase her daily income to attain her goals in life.\r\n\r\nHer goal is to send her children to school because they are really willing to study, especially her eldest child who is presently in secondary level. She and her husband are hoping to provide their children with their educational needs. And by working hard, they know that they can achieve all their goals for their children\u2019s welfare.\r\n\r\nMarites is a 36-year-old businesswoman who is married to Jimmy L. Sr. They live in Cabaruan, Naguilian, Isabela. They are blessed with four children who are all studying at the moment. The eldest is Jimmy L. Jr., he is 15 years old, Mary Joy is 13 years old, Mary Jane is 11 years old and Jerome, the youngest, is 6 years old.\r\n\r\nMarites is glad to have a happy and wonderful family.

happiness.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":321247,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fuel\/Firewood","sector":"Retail","use":"To

is already 50 years old and married to Crispin L.. They are blessed with four children. The eldest is Crispin L., Jr., second is Celito, the third is Maria, and the youngest is May-Anne, who is still studying in college and hopefully will finish her studies to have a good employment in the future. The couple lives together with their children in the village of Cabaruan, Naguilian, Isabela.\r\n\r\nPuriza is engaged in making and selling \u201clabong\u201d in their village. \u201cLabong\u201d is a kind of vegetable that is used in vegetarian dishes. It comes from young bamboo shoots. Puriza is gaining an income of one thousand pesos weekly in selling \u201clabong\u201d in their village. She wants to acquire many customers to be able to earn more profit.\r\n\r\nFor this, she is requesting a loan of PHP 5,000 to buy a large quantity of \u201clabong\u201d to sell in their village and in the market. Puriza would also like to revive her old bankrupt store to further generate additional income. Her store has been closed due to lack of funds.\r\n\r\nShe is hoping to have some savings with the help of ASKI (Alalay sa Kaunlaran, Inc.) and, through her sacrifices, she believes that God will guide her to be able to attain all her goals. She also dreams to send her youngest child to school and have her finish a college course someday. She will be in second year college next school year and it will require more income for her to pursue her studies. Lastly, Puriza shared an inspiring quotation that says; \u201cIf others can, why can\u2019t

","en":"Umed S. was born in 1985. He recently married Yorkina, and is very happy. Thanks to raising livestock, which he has done for the past six years, he was able to have a wedding.
