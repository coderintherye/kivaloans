Her greatest monthly expenses include paying utility bills, school fees for children and medication and feeding the family. \r\n\r\nFaith owns a stall selling second hand clothes in Ntinda. She works seven days a week and receives an average of 10 customers a day. She has done this business for over ten years. She incurs transport costs to and from buying clothes from the Owino market, one of the busiest markets in Uganda. Her main challenges are seasonality and transportation of clothes from Owino market to her place of work in Ntinda.  She sells on retail basis only. Faith has been with MCDT for four years and is servicing her fifth loan, working with the same group mates. She wants to use this loan to buy more bales of second hand clothes.

The family has three meals a day.\r\n\r\nRebecca owns a stall in Makerere Kikoni selling different types of cosmetics on a retail basis only. She has operated this business for over ten years and works seven days a week. She receives an average of twenty customers a day. \r\n\r\nRebecca incurs transport costs to and from buying cosmetics from shops in Kikuubo, one of the busiest places in Uganda. Her main challenges are seasonality and transportation of cosmetics from shops in Kikuubo to her place of work. Her greatest monthly expenses include paying utility bills, medication and feeding the family.\r\n\r\nRebecca has been with MCDT for two years and is servicing her fourth loan, working all this time with the same group members. She wants to use this loan to buy more boxes of cosmetics.\r\n\r\nRebecca is aspiring to see her business grow bigger and to start selling wholesale

She understands her customers, their demands and the increasing need for firewood in her area. She is confident that her business will continue to provide revenue for reinvestment and to meet her family\u2019s needs.\n\nRita hopes to use the profits from her business to provide for her children including providing her family with meals. She will also be utilizing the revenue to take care of some personal medical needs.\n\nRita\u2019s loan will be provided through the Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE), a non-profit NGO (non-governmental organization) based in Bamenda, Cameroon. GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.

She lives in the Ciudadela 20 de Julio neighborhood in the city of Baranquilla. She works in general merchandise and she has three children: 30, 28 and 19 years old. She has been a client of the Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo for 20 years and she has received 29 credits during that time. They have really changed her lifestyle, including the education goals of her children. This one that she is asking for now is to pay for her younger daughter's 5th semester.  \r\n\r\nShe grew up with her parents and her twelve siblings in the Nueva Esperanza neighborhood. Since she was twelve, she has been working selling childrens' dresses and other merchandise. She would pay her monthly tuition and help support her family with the profits she obtained. Suffering from domestic trauma, she had to leave her high school studies halfway through and begin to work as a store employee. Gradually, she gained the confidence of her bosses and without any schooling in it became the manager of this business. She left this ten years later. With her severance package she bought the home she still lives in with her three children. They are her reason for being and it is they who drive her to work and make an effort every day to get them ahead.   \r\n\r\nLuz Marina, with the motto \"I never look back, only ahead\", is a fighter who has been separated for the last 17 years. Her business card is an independent, honest and responsible job with which she has been able to give her three children professional educations. She has been supported with education loans for her family. These are only given to good clients at the Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo. This organization has given her financing to strengthen her business of merchandise sales, which she distributes throughout Baranquilla. She states that her business is the sale of shoes, clothing, appliances, gold and silver jewelry, miscelaneous and paper products. It has been going for 30 years and its smooth operation is the product of her experience acquired as a store employee and from entering the loan program at the Fundacion, which has lent her money to increase her working capital. This has meant prosperity for her and has allowed her to finish many of her projects and goals. One of these is to watch her youngest daughter become a professional. This is why she is aplying for a loan in the amount of $1.575.532. Another goal is to have her own locale in the center of town. All of her life she has been in the business of various merchandise and she wants to continue growing. \r\n\r\nWith her years of experience as a business person, she says that \"It's not all profit.\" Her clients buy her merchandise on credit and at times she has had to lose with some clients. This is why she takes references into account and she wants her clients to be employed. Her dream is for her daughter to finish college and her goal is to have a locale in downtown Baranquilla.        \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ellen Donohue, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":475756,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"Her daughter's college education ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2010-01-30T14:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luz Marina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1575532,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":254484},{"due_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":256100},{"due_date":"2010-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":260368},{"due_date":"2010-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":264707},{"due_date":"2010-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":269119},{"due_date":"2010-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":270754}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.22},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":130.04},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.2},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.41},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.65},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.48}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":129.22,"local_amount":254484,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:09:32Z","rounded_local_amount":257300.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123913413,"comment":null},{"amount":130.04,"local_amount":256100,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:01:13Z","rounded_local_amount":258934.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128949027,"comment":null},{"amount":132.2,"local_amount":260368,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:33:02Z","rounded_local_amount":263249.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136677817,"comment":null},{"amount":134.41,"local_amount":264707,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:18:58Z","rounded_local_amount":267636.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144712191,"comment":null},{"amount":136.65,"local_amount":269119,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:47:36Z","rounded_local_amount":272097.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151895697,"comment":null},{"amount":137.48,"local_amount":270754,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:12:09Z","rounded_local_amount":273750.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159636021,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-01-30T16:32:27Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:12:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":173040,"name":"Lina Esther","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Lina B.

En un taller de confecciones en el barrio Campestre de la ciudad de Cartagena, hay una mujer dotada de creatividad, que ense\u00f1a un arte del que  ha vivido siempre, a j\u00f3venes para que encuentren en \u00e9l una forma de ganarse la vida honradamente, como lo ha hecho ella ella desde que abri\u00f3 su taller de Confecciones en su propia casa, con el que devenga un salario para apoyar la gesti\u00f3n de su familia junto a su esposo, que trabaja como vigilante. Esta mujer es Alexi L., tiene 42 a\u00f1os de edad y tres hijos de 22, 16 y 14 a\u00f1os, actualmente estudiando simult\u00e1neamente en carreras t\u00e9cnica, profesional y de bachiller; con ellos est\u00e1 asociada su meta principal: \u201cEducarlos y apoyar su formaci\u00f3n profesional, para que teniendo acceso a oportunidades  sean unas personas de bien\u201d.     \n\nPara Alexi, la Hermosa ciudad de Cartagena de Indias, la heroica, con su mezcla de arquitectura moderna y Colonial, ha sido el escenario perfecto donde se inici\u00f3 con una vieja maquina de coser y un mercado domestico entre vecinos, familiares y amigos cercanos, que le llevaban las telas para que elaborar sus vestidos; al principio debi\u00f3 pagar el servicio de fileteado, pues no tenia maquinaria para realizar esta operaci\u00f3n, que le daba el acabado perfecto a sus productos. Por eso cuando escuch\u00f3 hablar de la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo a sus vecinos, no dud\u00f3 en solicitar el apoyo de su primer financiamiento para compra la fileteadora que tanto necesitaba  y telas e insumos con los cuales empez\u00f3 a elaborar sus primeras creaciones, para venderlas con gran aceptaci\u00f3n de la clientela; esto hizo que pensara en capacitarse e inici\u00f3 seminarios de dise\u00f1o de modas para el perfeccionamiento de su t\u00e9cnica y al observar como su negocio crec\u00eda gradualmente, se arriesg\u00f3 a  reemplazar su vieja y apreciada maquina de coser. \n\nAunque ella desea profesionalizarse en dise\u00f1o de modas, dice que su primer compromiso es ver a sus hijos convertidos en profesionales y ella debe esperar su momento, por eso est\u00e1 apunt\u00e1ndole con esfuerzos entusiastas a su negocio y se mantiene actualizada con cursos cortos que le permiten estar atenta a las nuevas tendencias de la moda y los requerimientos de su mercado.\n\nAlexi ha recibido varios cr\u00e9ditos de la Fundaci\u00f3n, siete de los cuales en la l\u00ednea de capital de trabajo y los dos \u00faltimos de educaci\u00f3n, que consideran son de mucha importancia para que ella no tenga que recurrir a agiotistas y endeude su patrimonio, como lo hacia antes de estar con la Fundaci\u00f3n. El cr\u00e9dito al que aplica y con el que espera ser apoyada en pro del bienestar de su familia, esta dirigido a pagarle el \u00faltimo semestre universitario en la carrera de contadur\u00eda Publica a James, su hijo mayor, quien sin graduarse trabaja como auxiliar contable y se prepara para ayudar a que sus hermanos alcancen sus sue\u00f1os educativos.\n\nDesde su vinculaci\u00f3n al programa de la Fundaci\u00f3n, Alexi ha visto su negocio crecer, pudo renovar su maquinaria de confecci\u00f3n y ha sacado a sus hijos adelante especialmente en lo relacionado con la educaci\u00f3n. Su principal desaf\u00edo familiar siempre ha sido el cumplimiento con la multiplicidad de sus rolles como esposa, madre y empresaria; Ella considera que la educaci\u00f3n de los hijos es tarea de los padres y no las delega como ocurre cuando ambos padres trabajan.\n\nAlexi y su esposo han levantado a sus hijos en el barrio Campestre, ubicado en el suroccidente de la hermosa Cartagena, este un lugar modesto con calles angostas, vecinos solidarios, muchos escenarios deportivos y una pista de patinaje p\u00fablico, donde la comunidad ha visto de cerca los juegos Centroamericanos y del Caribe. En el escenario del barrio Campestre, es com\u00fan  ver los vecinos practicando el patinaje, por eso se ha convertido en el semillero de futuras estrellas de este deporte, en el que Colombia se destaca con la muy joven  Cecilia \u201cla Chechi Baena, que se mantiene arrasando con medallas en cada mundial  y ha sido 6 veces campeona en la m\u00e1xima categor\u00eda del patinaje en l\u00ednea; la Chechi como todos la llaman, es la insignia y el par\u00e1metro que impulsa a muchos j\u00f3venes de la comunidad a progresar, este es el ambiente donde tambi\u00e9n Alexi y su esposo ha educado a sus tres hijos.\n","en":"In a seamstress shop in the Campestre neighborhood of the city of Cartagena, there is a woman who is gifted with creativity.  She teaches the art, which she has always had, to youngsters. She does this so that they can, through their creativity, find an honorable way of earning a living like she has done.  She opened her seamstress shop in her own house, and she earns a salary to help her husband support the family.  Her husband is a watchman.\r\n\r\nThis woman is Alexi L\u00f3pex.  She is 42, and she has three children; 22, 16, and 14.  The children are currently simultaneously studying a technical career, a professional career, and a high school degree.  Her primary goal for them is, \u201cTo educate them and support their professional training so that they have access to opportunities and become \r\ngood people\u201d.\r\n\r\nFor Alexi, the beautiful city of Cartagena de Indias, the heroic, with its mixture of modern and colonial architecture, has been the perfect place to start with an old sewing machine and a domestic market among her neighbors, family, and close friends.  They brought her fabrics in order for her to make their clothes.  At first she had to pay for the finishing service because she did not have a machine to do this operation and give a perfect finishing to her products.  That is why when she heard her neighbors talking about the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation; she did not hesitate in asking for the support of her first loan to buy an overlock sewing machine, which she needed so much.  She also needed fabrics and supplies to make her first creations.  They were widely accepted by the customers who bought them.  This made her think of training, and she started fashion design seminars to perfect her technique.  She saw how her business gradually grew, and she took a chance on replacing her prized old sewing machine.\r\n\r\nEven though she wishes to become a professional in fashion design, she says that her first commitment is to see her children become professionals.  She needs to wait for her time.  That is why she is enthusiastically putting her efforts into her business.  She stays fulfilled with short courses that allow her to be aware of the new fashion trends and the market\u2019s requirements.\r\n\r\nAlexi has received various loans from the Foundation.  Seven of them have been for working capital.  The last two have been for education.  She considers them to be very important so that she does not have to go to moneylenders and put up her assets for the debt.  This is what she did before she was with the Foundation.  The loan she is asking for and hopes to receive for her family\u2019s well being is to pay for the last the last semester of study in the university for her oldest son, James.  He is studying for a career in Public Accounting.  Without graduating he works as an accounting assistant.  He is preparing to help his sibling reach their educational dreams.\r\n\r\nAlexi has seen her business grow since joining the program with the Foundation.  She was able to renovate her sewing machinery, and she has been able to get her children ahead, especially in the area of education.  Her main family challenge has always been fulfilling her multiple rolls as wife, mother, and business person.  She considers the education of the children to be the parents\u2019 job, and she does not delegate that as it happens when both parents work.\r\n\r\nAlexi and her husband have raised their children in the Campestre neighborhood, which is southwest of the beautiful Cartagena.  It is a modest place with narrow streets, united neighbors, many sporting areas, and a public skating rink where the community has seen the Central American games of the Caribbean up close.  In the Campestre neighborhood it is common to see the neighbors practicing their skating, and it has become the source of future stars of this sport.  Colombia stands out in this sport with the very young Cecilia, \u201cLa Chechi Baena\u201d, who keeps winning medals in each world competition.  She has been a champion six times in the category of in line skating.  \u201cLa Chechi\u201d, as everyone calls her, is the symbol and parameter that motivates lots of youngsters of the community to progress.

Garc\u00eda, 53, lives in the Claret neighborhood in Bogot\u00e1.  It is the most heavily populated area of Colombia, and it is its most important cultural and economic center.  It is also called \u201cThe Athens of South America\u201d.  People from all over the country live here, and they have contributed the ancient cultural traditions of Bogot\u00e1.  They are introducing new generations to ways of being and doing things.  This is the case with Mar\u00eda Margarita.  She is from C\u00facuta of the Norte de Santandar department, and she came to Bogot\u00e1 seven years ago to be close to her children.  Her children came looking for the opportunity to educate themselves and become police officials in the capital of Colombia.  Mar\u00eda Margarita had a commercial activity in her native city, and she moved it to the Claret neighborhood in Bogot\u00e1.  It is located near the Military School.  This is a commercial area where you can find banks, clothing shops, and book stores.  The name comes from the Claretiana Community, which was blessed by priests who lived there.  This was how the infrastructure was when she decided to sell her products by catalog in this neighborhood.  They say that it is not easy to live in another city far from your family where people do not know you.  Also, you need a lot of money to devote to the education of your children, the costs of military careers, and to change cities.  This appears to be her biggest challenge.\r\n\r\nShe is currently married, and she has two children; 27 and 25.  They are now police officers.  Her business consists of catalog sales of jewelry, jeans, and purses.  This is her first loan with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation.  She has participated with the organization in learning processes to increase her skills in managing the market and entrepreneurial loans.  Mar\u00eda Margarita is applying for a loan for 1,500,000 COP to buy two jewelry display packages that have approximately two and a half dozen earrings, six rings, and six chains.

She is married without children but keeps busy selling French fries, fruit juice and custard. She also has a sewing activity. She counts a little over two years of experience. Untimely power cuts are the main reason for her discontinuing her sewing activity and redirecting all her efforts towards selling juice and fries. Therefore she is requesting a 200,000 francs loan to build up a stock of the ingredients she uses to make her products (potatoes, powdered milk, sugar).

O. is a 28-year-old mother of two. Both children are grade school students. She is a native of Talim Island in the town of Binangonan, which is located in the Rizal Province in the Philippines. She is happily living with her two children and her 32-year-old husband Darwin O., who is a fisherman and bamboo set maker (furniture). \r\n\r\nShe dreams of escaping the spiral of poverty. She joined ASHI (Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and KIVA partner in the Philippines, in 2009 with the hope of having access to capital to start a business. She and her husband used to be partners in their bamboo set making business. Since then her business has continued to grow and provide good income for her family but income from the business is not enough to sustain their everyday needs. Therefore, she now requests her second loan in the amount of 10,000 pesos to use as working capital to start a fish cage business for supplementary income. The loan will be used to pay for 20 bundles of fishnet, bamboo, and labor expenses.\r\n\r\nShe is looking forward to an increased demand for fish on the island so her secondary business will grow and generate enough income for her family. She dreams of sending her children to school until they finish college and to find stable living.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":480921,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","use":"To start a fish

P. is the 24-year-old mother of two kids. Her husband, Alvin Pascual, is a bamboo set maker. When she got married, she started a bamboo set making business. Their income is not enough to support the needs of their growing kids. Marisol joined ASHI (Ahon sa Hirap, Inc.) in 2009 to get capital to start a secondary fishing business. Now, she applied for a second loan to buy fishing materials like fishnet, bamboo and other materials for her business. \r\n\r\nMarisol dreams of expanding her fish cage in the future to raise more fish. She also wants to save money from her bamboo set business to meet their daily needs. She hopes that someday, through her loans from ASHI in partnership with Kiva, she will be able to discover skills to engage in a more productive business. She dreams to get out of the ties of poverty. That is one challenge in their lives.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":480923,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","use":"To buy

A. is a 34-year-old mother who is focused on her family\u2019s dream. She lives in the Coastal Place of Talim Island, Binangonan, Rizal, Philippines with her loving husband and two kids. The couple works hard to provide a better education for their children's future and they want a better life as well.\r\n\r\nThey decided to join the Kiva field partner, ASHI, in 2009 to get capital for their fishing business. They have requested a loan of 10,000 PHP. They will invest this capital to reconstruct fish cages and to buy more fishnets, bamboo and fingerlings (small fish). Winnie also has a secondary source of household income, which is hog fattening (raising pigs).\r\n\r\nShe hopes to build their own beautiful house, expand her fishing business and to have a larger space for their fishing equipment. She also dreams of a successful pig farm business. \r\n\r\nThe family feels very happy with the loan that helped their lives to become improved from before. Winnie will continue praying and wishing all lenders the best of luck, and she hopes they will continue to support poor families like them, who want to improve their standard of living.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":480962,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","use":"To

They live in the Coastal place of Talim Island, Rizal Province in the Philippines.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, they got the idea of joining ASHI (Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc.), which means \u201dTo rise up from poverty\u201d, an MFI and KIVA partner in the Philippines. She was given hope and the opportunity to acquire working capital, so she now runs her fishing business. The business has brought them good profits. Currently, on her second loan, she proposes the amount of 10,000 PHP as additional capital to pay for two sets of \"Baklad\" (fishing materials made of fishnet for creating fish pens), which cost 5,000 PHP each.\r\n\r\nCharis has simple dreams in life. She would like to have a durable, concrete house for themselves and for her future children. She also dreams of expanding the fishing business. With the service offered by ASHI, she believes that her dreams will come true. The couple is thankful that there is ASHI service in their

A. is a 27-year-old mother who cares for her four children. She is married to Ferdinand, who is a carpenter. To help her husband support the family, she started a business of making and selling doormats. \r\n\r\nWith dreams of getting away from poverty, she came up with the idea in 2008 of joining the Kiva field partner in the Philippines, ASHI (Ahon Sa Hirap Inc.), which means \u201cTo Rise Up from Poverty\u201d. Since her membership in the institution she had shown good performance in her credit rating (basis of loans), allowing her to get more capital for her business.\r\n\r\nNow on her third loan, she applied for 15,000 PHP to buy an assortment of raw materials for her business, such as cotton, flannel, and other supplies.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Swannie hopes to establish a shop where she can fulfill orders. She also wants to be able to save for her children's education and to have a comfortable house for living in with a happy family.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Please disregard the date appearing on the picture.

She lives in Antipolo, Rizal province, in the Philippines.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, she decided to join Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc. (ASHI), an MFI and Kiva partner in the Philippines, hoping to obtain working capital for her sari-sari store (general store). During her membership in ASHI, her performance has been noted well in repayment and in attendance in center meetings. Her business is still growing, so she is requesting a loan of 15,000 PHP to pay for assorted groceries for the store.\r\n\r\nWith the chance offered to her by ASHI, she believes that she is getting closer to the achievement of her dreams. She wants to help her grandchildren with their school fees and also to save for their future living, because she and her husband are getting old. \r\n\r\nNOTE: Please disregard the date appearing on the photo.

36-year-old, Josephine S. is a woman with the determination and faith needed to get out from the ties of poverty. She is the mother of five dependent children, all of whom need her support. She is married to Orlando Soriano, who is 37 years old and a mechanic, but his income is not enough for their daily needs. That is why Josephine has the initiative to engage in selling small goods to help her husband in supporting and raising their big family.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, as a mother of big dreams, she joined ASHI (Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc.), which means \u201dTo rise up from poverty\u201d, an MFI and KIVA partner in the Philippines. Since her membership, she opened a general store and it truly helps them to meet their needs.\r\n\r\nNow on her third loan, she is requesting the amount of 15,000 PHP to pay for two sacks of sugar, liquor, five sacks of rice, two sacks of charcoal, two containers of cooking oil and other groceries for her store.\r\n\r\nShe hopes that, with the help of ASHI and KIVA, she can have a successful mini-grocery in the future in order to pay for the needs of her children until they finish school with a degree. Her greatest dream is to reach her aspiration of stepping out from poverty.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Please disregard the date appearing on the picture.

She is seen as family support, since she cares for two other persons.\r\n\r\nIn 1999, she started in business by selling fabrics and perfume. Currently she has chosen a different orientation: selling exclusively hay and cattle feed. She chose to develop commercial activities as she was not successful in school. She has also some experience as a seamstress, and even obtained a diploma in embroidery.\r\n\r\nHowever, her passion remains centred on her current business. What interests her most is when earnings are realised.

is a 30-year-old engaged man living in Tyre, southern Lebanon, where he has been working as a home painter since 2000. When he first started the business, which he entered because of his experience, he didn\u2019t face difficulties except making himself known to the public.  He is requesting a loan from Al Majmoua to purchase paint and painting tools for his work.

Samuel hopes someday to own a slaughterhouse and supply meat as a wholsaler in the Burma market. He is grateful to Faulu Kenya for helping him to expand his business.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Marianela will invest this loan in buying charcoal as well as pineapples to sell, and in remodeling the roof of her storage room, so that her products do not get wet. Her dream is to have a permanent store in her home. Her great motivation is to provide her children with economic stability and a good education, so that they will not lack the necessities in the future. \r\n\r\nOne of the things Marianela enjoys very much about working with the Fondo Esperanza (Hope Fund) are the entrepreneurial training workshops provided by the Fund. \r\n\r\nTemuco is the capital of the Araucan\u00eda Region.

in 1948, Tamumang J. is married  and they are having three children. Due to the fact that he is too difficult for him to take care of the family single-handedly and provide the children\u2019s basic care, and also that his wife could not do it alone, he decided to join GHAPE in 1998. Also, he has been having a lot of marital problems with his family and this has made him sad all the time, but he is appreciative of the fact that he is alive.\n\nJ. desire is to give his children love and education. He states that he feels better each time he provides something small for his children. His inability to get investment capital which could constantly generate income for him to meet his children\u2019s needs is what motivated him to obtain a loan from GHAPE.\n\nGiven the loan, J. plans to buy a motorcycle to start a transportation business. He knows this business will succeed because he is located at a good business site and he has a good rider for the motorcycle. He plans to use the generated profits to sponsor his children in school and to cater for the basic needs of his family.\n\n\n\n\nAbout GHAPE\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO (non-governmental organization) based in Bamenda, Cameroon. GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach. Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profit and loss, and family values. Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement. GHAPE instils a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\n"}},"status":"deleted","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":481453,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","use":"To purchase a motorcycle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Alabukam, Mankon, NW.

She has nine children, the youngest still in primary school.  For the last sixteen years she has worked selling tortillas.  She buy the corn by the quintal (46 kilograms), and she gets up very early to grind it.  She leaves the corn soaking at night, forms the tortillas in the morning, and then sells them to her customers.  She thanks God for having allowed her to have her own business.   For many years she worked as a domestic servant, but that work was poorly paid and very tiring.  Now she is able to watch over her children and her home.\r\nWith the loan she will buy construction materials such as: stone, sand, cement, and zinc to finish dividing up the rooms.  Her wood  and zinc house is small and simple, and now very old.  She hasn\u2019t been able to improve the house for her family because of lack of money.  With hard work and the interest that she has, she will repair  the rooms  with each loan from the institution.   She needs to build cement walls, change the roof, the doors, and put tile on the dirt floors.  She hopes to do all this over a period of time.  She is very thankful for the loans.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Miriam Palacio, Kiva

Knowing that his current cab needed upgrading to meet more rigorous safety requirements, Fabian's family urged him to contact ACCION USA for a micro-loan.\r\n\r\nFabian\u2019s loan will be used to purchase a new car, without which he would lose his livelihood. Since both Fabian's family in New York and his relatives in his native Ecuador rely on his income, Fabian is very glad that he was able to get the financing needed to keep his business afloat. While he was able to learn how to navigate New York City streets on his own, he credits ACCION USA with helping him navigate the US financial system.\r\n\r\nFabian hopes to eventually save enough money to buy a house here, and realize his own American Dream.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About U.S. Microfinance and ACCION USA:<\/b>\r\nHave you ever thought about how the cute new caf\u00e9 on your corner or the salon you frequent every month got the financial resources to start their business? Chances are, they drummed up support from their friends and family, dipped into their personal savings, used a high-interest credit card, or all of the above. An estimated ten million small businesses in the U.S. face difficulty obtaining loans from traditional banks, even prior to the current \u201ccredit crisis\u201d. Microfinance institutions, like ACCION USA, support these \u201cunbanked\u201d small businesses by giving them access to fairly-priced capital and business education.\r\n\r\nSmall businesses also help stabilize low- to moderate-income neighborhoods and rebuild our economy through income growth and job creation. Self-employment provides workers with a way to increase their incomes, support their families, and strengthen their communities. As unemployment rises in the U.S., more and more people are turning to self-employment and start-up enterprises as a way to take control of their economic futures and provide employment opportunities in their communities. The need for support of small businesses in the U.S. is great, and it is one that ACCION USA has been striving to meet since 1991.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":9000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":7273.53,"image":{"id":479733,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","use":"To

En ese entonces su madre apoyaba las campa\u00f1as de alfabetizaci\u00f2n y ayudaba a mujeres en el cuidado y la complementacion de actividades acad\u00e8micas de sus hijos, para generar algunos ingresos con el apoyo de Maggui; ese precisamente fu\u00e8 el origen de un peque\u00f1o colegio en proceso de normatizaci\u00f2n  de su madre en el barrio Nuevo Milenio del Municipio de Soledad y donde Maggi tambien trabaja parte de su tiempo, pues es una joven muy productiva.   \nMaggi tiene su propio negocio que inici\u00f2 con la ayuda de un programas de gobierno  el cual inici\u00f2 con un computador que aprendi\u00f2 a operarlo; luego accedi\u00f2 a un cr\u00e9dito con la misma entidad para comprar otros equipos mas y aceder a la red de internet para luego gradualmente adicionar una fotocopiadora, una m\u00e1quina reveladora y una m\u00e1quina fotogr\u00e1fica. Al principio con un computador en su casa y muchos libros pestaba servicios bibliotecarios de consulta en el barrio,a estudiantesen en su barrio, donde la mayoria de vecinos son desplazados por el conflicto armado como su familia. Aunque parece que para Maggi eso es hoy parte de la historia, porque ella no quiere regresar a Casacar\u00e1, como han hecho muchos de sus habitantes apoyados por el estado para su retorno;dice  que con sus negocios, ella y su mam\u00e0 han logrado salir adelante, ayudar a su hermano menor y apoyar el ingreso de su padre al hogar, lo cual le ha proporcionado cierta estabilidad.\nMaggi, al mismo tiempo que trabaja siempre ha estudiado y desde el nivel de educaci\u00f2n secundaria se ha enfocado en la pedagogia; actualmente estudia licenciatura en eduaci\u00f2n b\u00e0sica en la Universidad del Atl\u00e0ntico; ella est\u00e0 en la busqueda de ganarse un escalafon en el sistema Educativo formal y por eso dia a dia se esfuerza por estudiar, asi como lo hizo cuando con su mami a clases, preparandose juntas para tener herramientas pedagogicas aplicables a su trabajo en el colegio; permitiendole a su madre cuidarla de cerca pues termin\u00f2 el bachillerato a los 15 a\u00f1os. \nMaggi es una joven polifac\u00e8tica le encanta el arte de fotografiar, por eso en su local adem\u00e0s de hacer fotomontajes, fotos para documentos y de tipo social, por ejemplo fotografias de bautizos, cumplea\u00f1os primeras comuniones etc. ayuda a la gente a acceder a la tencologia de internet y a hacer trasncripciones para presenter curriculos de trabajo, o para averiguar informaci\u00f2n de algun programa al que estan aplicando,  ya que en  esta comunidad  no es muy usual que la gente conozca el manejo de las herramientas de informatica y mucho menos tenga una red de internet personal a su disposicion y es menos comun saber acceder a ella. \nEl negocio principal de Maggi es una sala de internet, donde ademas presta el servicio de fotocopiado, fotografia, fotomontaje, colajes para los ni\u00f1os, redacciones y transcripciones. Ella es una joven ejemplar, por su gran sentido de responsabilidad, su capacidad de trabajar y estudiar desarrollada desde muy ni\u00f1a  y su disposicion para acceder a los servicios que fortalecen su crecimiento personal y empresarial; asi fu\u00e8 cuando le recomendaron ir a la Fundaci\u00f2n Mario Santo Domingo para obtener un cr\u00e8dito que incrementara su capital de trabajo y para recibir asesor\u00eca para formalizar su peque\u00f1o negocio a lo que ella inmediatamente accedi\u00f2 y en la actualidad su asesor Milgen Sanchez la est\u00e0 asesorando en este tr\u00e0mite .\nCon el actual y su primer credito por valor de $1.500.000, Maggi planea ampliar su negocio adecuando su sala de internet para tomar fotografias, hacer pendones publicitarios, con el fin de ser mas conocida por otras comunidades  cercanas. Ella considera que su negocio es muy estable, no tiene competencia en el barrio, por eso sus clientes muchas veces esperan en su puerta hasta que otro termine de acceder al servicio por el que vino al negocio.\nSu principal desafio que es el de todos en la familia, trabajar intensamente para apoyar el tratamiento de su padre que sufrio un Accidente de trabajo y su programa de salud no alcanza a cubrir los medicamentos  que requiere para superar la situaci\u00f2n. De igual manera sue\u00f1a con ayudar a su hermano a que desarrolle sus potencialidades y estudie en la universidad la carrera que le guste; mientras tanto ella sue\u00f1a con subir de escalafon  en el sistema educativo y legalizar el colegio de su madre\nMaggi  y su mama, describen su barrio, Nuevo Milenio, como una comunidad donde la mayoria son  desplazados, pero muy por encima de eso son gente solidaria y trabajadora; explica  que tuvieron que organizarse para que sus calles pasaran de ser un basurero a lo que es h\u00f2y,  ya que fu\u00e8 producto de una invasion que el estado esta legalizando; sostiene que entre todos han contribuido a poner servicios publicos comunitarios  y  que a trav\u00e8s de su negocio contribuye a llevar tecnologia a los hogares mas pobres, pues son muchos, los que aun no tienen posibilidades de acceder a la redes de Internet y de conocer el manejo de la informatica.\n","en":"\r\nMaggi Isabel B. is 20.  She arrived from Casacar\u00e1 in the Cesar department with her parents and brother about 15 years ago.  Ever since she was a little girl necessity make her think of generating income.  She could not continue living in the town where she was born because of the fear of some of its inhabitants.  This caused her to abandon the place where she was born and go to Soledad.  There she found international institutions that encouraged her to study by giving her school supplies and a book of stories.  At that time her mother supported the literacy campaigns, and she helped women in the care and completion of the academic activities of their children.  She did this with Maggi\u2019s help to generate some income.  This was the start of a small school, which was part of her mother\u2019s adjustment to the Nuevo Milenio neighborhood in the municipality of Soledad.  Maggi also worked there part time; she is a very productive young woman.\r\n\r\nMaggi has her own business, which she started with the help of a government program.  She started with a computer, which she learned to operate.  Then she got a loan with the same entity to buy other equipment and access the Internet.  Then she gradually added a photocopier, a developing machine, and a photography machine.  At first she used a computer and a lot of books to offer librarian services from her house to neighborhood students.  Most of the neighbors are displaced due to the armed conflict, just like her family.  Although it may appear to be part of the story, Maggi does not want to return to Casacar\u00e1 like many people, who are supported by the state, have done.  She says that with their businesses she and her mother have gotten ahead, helped her younger brother, and helped with the income her father brings home.  This has given them some stability.\r\n\r\nAt the same time that Maggi has worked she has always gone to school.  She has been focusing on pedagogy since high school.  She is currently studying for her degree in basic education from the Atlantic University.  She is looking to win a place in the formal education system.  Therefore, she studies hard everyday, just like she did with her mother.  They prepared themselves together to have the pedagogy tools that applied to their work in the school.  This allowed her mother to be close and take care of her.  Magi got her high school degree at 15.  \r\n\r\nMaggi is a multi-faceted young woman.  She loves the art of photography.  At her place she does more than photo montages, photos for documents, and social photos.  For example, she does baptism photos, birthdays, and communions, etc.  She helps people access the technology of the internet, make job resumes, or to find information about a program they are using.  It is unusual in this community for the people to know how to use information tools, and even less common for them to have the use of the internet at their disposal.  It is less likely that they know how to access the internet.\r\n\r\nMaggi\u2019s main business is a large internet caf\u00e9, where she also offers photocopy, photography, photo montage, collages for children, editing, and transcription services.  She is an exemplary young woman because of her great sense of responsibility, her work capacity, her studies since childhood, and her aptitude for accessing the services that strengthen her personal and business growth.  That is how it was when they recommended that she go to the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation to get a loan to increase her working capital and to get an advisor to formalize her small business.  She immediately got a counselor, Milgen Sanchez, who is currently advising her in this procedure.\r\n\r\nMaggi plans to expand her business using her current first loan for 1,500,000 COP.   She will equip her internet caf\u00e9 with the ability to take photos and make publicity banners.  She will do this to become better known in nearby communities.  She considers her business to be very stable.  She does not have competition in the neighborhood, and many times her neighbors wait at her door for their turn to get the services they wish to access.\r\n\r\nHer main challenge is the same as with all families.  She works intensely to support her father\u2019s treatment.  He suffered a work accident, and his health program does not cover the medications he needs to overcome the situation.  She also dreams of helping her brother develop his potential and study for a career he would like in the university.  Meanwhile, she dreams of climbing the ladder in the educational system and legalizing her mother\u2019s school. \r\n\r\nMaggi and her mother describe their neighborhood, Nuevo Milenio, as a community where most are displaced.  But, underneath it all, they are united and hard-working people.  She explains that they had to organize themselves so that their streets would stop being a garbage dump into what it is now.  It was a product of an invasion that the state is legalizing.  Everyone has contributed to establishing community public services.  Through her business she is contributing to bringing technology to the poorest homes.  There are a lot of people who still cannot access the internet and do not know how to work with computers.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

Carmen is a very happy and witty woman who is well known by her neighbors.  She has 4 children ranging from 46 to 57 years old.  Before she got married, she always liked working.  This very spontaneous, hard-working woman worked for some time in the business very common in her home city--raising livestock.  She has worked since she was very young--working as a maid, selling wholesale merchandise, renting a locale in the market--she did a little bit of everything in order to provide furniture and appliances for her home and to raise her children, providing them with a better standard of living while instilling principles of honesty and responsibility.\r\n\r\nWhen Maicao-Guajira, the town on the Venezuelan border, was at the height of its economic boom, she traveled constantly bringing wholesale merchandise that she sold in the markets or to other door-to-door salesmen, but when she got married, her husband didn't want her to keep traveling so she got a locale in the market where she sold soups.  Nonetheless, she didn't stop selling merchandise and sharpening her ingenuity to provide for her clientele and find new ways to earn income.  She began making women's underwear and purchased sewing machines to do her work, this caused her husband to dub her \"The woman of 7 businesses.\"\r\n\r\nCurrently, she lives with her daughter, who works in the hospital, and with her grandchildren.  She is very enterprising and she doesn't like to wait for people to give her money.  She is self-sufficient and taught her children and grandchildren by word and example, \"if someone lends you money from their savings, you should pay them back punctually.\"  She proudly has provided for her family and when she lent money to her grandson so he could go to school to become a police officer, she said, \"He is very reliable and will put it in his savings account; when he graduates, he will be able to say, 'The money was in good hands.'\"\r\n\r\nShe has used the two loans from the Foundation to create new business and enlarge and strengthen her many enterprises; now banks call her to offer her loans but she only seeks loans from the Foundation--this current loan is for $525 which she will use to buy plastic chairs and cloth to fulfill her orders of women's underwear.  Her dream is to always \"Keep on living\" because at 70 years old, it is the greatest thing one can ask for from God--to continue strong and healthy, and not \"kick the bucket.\"<br

fabrica calzado para damas caballeros y para ni\u00f1os, los cuales produce  por encargo de sus clientes.\nAntonio dise\u00f1a los modelos de acuerdo a la moda, requerimientos y necesidades de sus

\n","en":"\r\nFor Antonio Jos\u00e9, shoemaking has always been the source of his family\u2019s income because it\u2019s a family tradition that he is now continuing.  His shoemaking business began when he was still a young boy and he used to help his father.  This was his first training in this field, where he learned how to be on his own.  Later on, he worked for several shoemaking companies where he deepened his knowledge and experience.  However, his salary as an employee was not sufficient because he wanted to be independent.  \r\n\r\nHe took the leap and started his own business.  It was quite an effort but, for the last four years, he has had his own cobbler\u2019s shop where he manufactures shoes for women, men and children.  He works based on prior orders from his customers.  Antonio designs the shoes according to the latest fashions and his customer\u2019s needs and wishes.  His greatest challenge is to be up-to-date on innovations so that he can always be on the cutting edge of his field so he must be aware of what\u2019s in the latest kraft journals, he must visit shoe stores, observe artists, and do whatever is necessary to be tuned into supply, demand, and the latest fashions, in order to offer his customers the very best.\r\n\r\nAntonio is 35 years old and is a cheerful and calm person.  He lives in his own house, which is in Atl\u00e1ntico department.

is 45 years old and married with four children, ages 8, 9, 10, and 12, and all of the children are attending school. He is a dairy farmer in the Nkubu area near Mount Kenya. He's been in this business for 15 years and sells fine beans, bananas, and milk to local brokers. Previously, he worked as the middle-man, buying bananas from farms and selling them in Nairobi. He says that the main challenge to his business are diseases that affect the dairy cow.<P>\r\n\r\nHe has successfully repaid two previous loans through Juhudi Kilimo for Kes. 20,000 and 45,000 and requested this loan for Kes. 70,000 to purchase a dairy cow. John says that the dairy cow will provide milk for his children to drink as well as income to help him provide an education for his children. In the future, he would like to expand his dairy farming with a better cow shed. <P>\r\n\r\nJohn added that loans from Juhudi have really helped because he has gotten both income and manure for his farm from the dairy cows.<P>\r\n\r\nAbout Juhudi Kilimo<P>\r\n\r\nJuhudi Kilimo is an innovative, for-profit social enterprise working with smallholder farmers in Kenya. Juhudi directly finances dairy cows, chickens, agricultural equipment, and other assets that are specifically chosen to create immediate cash flow. Many of the assets are insured to prevent devastating business losses, and targeted technical assistance is provided to farmers, from agricultural training to basic bookkeeping and local market research. For its clients and their families, Juhudi also offers life insurance and a medical aid program. Through all these services, Juhudi is creating sustainable growth and employment in rural communities across

is a 26-year-old entrepreneur and dairy farmer in the Litein area of the South Rift Valley of Kenya. He's been farming for five years and employs two people. He sells his milk through Kenya Cooperative Creameries and also earns income from a small general store. He previously worked as a motorbike taxi driver. He says that the main challenge to his business is unreliable employees that require close supervision.<P>\r\n\r\nHe requested this loan through Juhudi Kilimo for Kes. 80,000 to purchase a dairy cow, after successfully repaying a previous loan for 45,000. He says he is enjoying good financial services through Juhudi which might not have been available to him otherwise. In the future, he would like to build a modern house, own his own car, and stabilize his family with increased income from farming.<P>\r\n\r\nAbout Juhudi Kilimo<P>\r\n\r\nJuhudi Kilimo is an innovative, for-profit social enterprise working with smallholder farmers in Kenya.

sur de la ciudad de Bogot\u00e1, cercado por el Rio San Cristobal; esta localidad es bien reconocida en la ciudad y en toda Colombia, porque su principal actividad econ\u00f3mica  es la venta de calzado y de los insumos para su fabricaci\u00f3n. Pablo nacido en La Vega municipio del departamento de Cundinamarca, que por su temperatura media: 22 \u00b0C. es llamado el Barrio caliente de Bogot\u00e1, hace 8 a\u00f1os inici\u00f2 su negocio \u201cLa Esperanza del Milenio, en una zona modesta vendiendo al detal  viveres y articulos de aseo; pero buscando mejores oportunidades comerciales desde hace 4 a\u00f1os se mud\u00f2 de barrio y es en la localidad mencionada en la que ahora reside, la cual est\u00e1 considerada como una de las mejores plazas de Bogot\u00e0, por estar  influenciada por actividades  de producci\u00f2n, comercio y servicios  financiero,actualmente muy cercanas a su tienda. Su incursi\u00f2n en el comercio fu\u00e8 impulsada por el desempleo que lo oblig\u00f2 a experimentar nuevas opciones  que  le sirvieran para el sostenimiento de su familia, desde ese momento  puso al descubierto la capacidad emprendedora y fortaleza de caracter que hoy lo caracterizan.\nInici\u00f2 en la Fundaci\u00f2n Mario Santo Domingo  en el a\u00f1o 2002 con un credito por valor de  $800.000, desde entonces  ha accedido a cuatro gradualmente aumentados, los cuales ha reembolsado  puntualmente, dando muestras en cada una de sus acciones de honestidad y amplio sentido de responsabilidad; Pablo dice que el negocio cambi\u00f2 su vida, mejor\u00f2 su forma de trabajar y lo ha visto crecer: especialmente porque ha podido reinvertir sus utilidades en activos fijos, lo que hace visible su ampliaci\u00f2n.  Su meta est\u00e0 relacionada con fortalecerlo, buscando incrementar los tiempos de descanso, mejorar su flujo de caja y ofrecer mejores productos .\nSu salud es su maximo desafio y acude a su fortaleza para conseguirla,  porque desde hace 2 a\u00f1os se ha quebrantado, pero dice, que ha logrado estabilizase mediante tratamientos bioenergeticos lo que  no  ha permitido que sus dolencias avancen.  \nEn la actualidad aplica a un credito por valor de $2.000.000 dirigido a aumentar el inventario de utiles escolares, refrescos, dulces, l\u00e0cteos y comestibles en general, que lo ayudar\u00e0 a hacer una oferta diversificada y sostenida de los productos que tienen mayor rotaci\u00f2n en su stand.\n\n","en":"\r\nPablo R. is 40 and married.  He has two children, 16 and 21.  His house is located in the southern part of Bogot\u00e1.  Surrounded by Lake San Cristobal, this location is well known in the city and in all of Columbia for the sale of footwear and the supplies to make the footwear.  Pablo was born in the La Vega municipality in the department of Cundinamarca.  The average temperature is 22\u00b0 C.  It is called the hot neighborhood of Bogot\u00e1.  He started his business, La Esperanza del Milenio, eight years ago in a modest area selling food and cleaning products.  Looking for other commercial opportunities, he moved neighborhoods four years ago, and he now lives in the above mentioned area.  It is considered to be one of the best plazas in Bogot\u00e1 because it is influenced by production, commerce, and financial services, which are currently very close to his store.\r\n\r\nHis entrance into commerce was driven by unemployment that obligated him to try different options, which would serve to support his family.  At that time he discovered his entrepreneurial capacity and his now characteristic strength of character.\r\n\r\nHe started with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation in 2002 with a loan for 800,000 COP.  From then on he has had four, gradually larger loans.  He has repaid them punctually, demonstrating honesty and a big sense of responsibility in each one of his actions.  Pablo says that the business changed his life.  He improved his way of working, and he has seen his business grow, especially because he was able to reinvest his profits into fixed assets.  This made his expansion clear.  His goal is related to strengthening it, looking to increase time off, improving his cash flow, and offering better products.\r\n\r\nHis health is his biggest challenge.  He looks to his strength to meet the challenge.  Two years ago he was hurt, but he says that he has been stabilized through bioenergetic treatments.  This has stopped his problems from advancing.\r\n\r\nHe is currently applying for a loan for 2,000,000 COP to increase his inventory of school supplies, soft drinks, sweets, dairy products, and general food.  This will help him offer a variety of products.  It will also help him keep his most popular products in stock at his stand.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

Alejando has a mill which is located in his home.  People come to have corn, beans, ingredients for salsa, and other things ground.  Mr. Alejandro has made his living this way for ten years which is why he would like to invest in his business, and is why he is asking for a loan. He would like to buy a motor that works with gasoline for his mill.  This would allow him to do a better job since the mill would work faster and better.

She lives alone in her own home because her children are grown and they all live in the United States. Ms. Rosa makes clothing for men, women, and children that she used to sell by walking the streets of Zapotit\u00e1n and Arce, both in the Province of La Libertad. She has worked in this area for many years. Because of her hard work and daily effort, she has achieved an acceptable profit in spite of sales not always being good, and some days when the sales are very low. \r\n\r\nShe requested a loan through which to buy more fabric, thread and all kinds of raw material for making clothing and thus be able to offer as many styles, sizes and colors of clothing, and to try to get more customers. She does all this in order to have the money to make a decent living, and be supplied with all the necessities. She also wants to finish repairing her house, as some walls and the roof are damaged. That is why she needs to improve her profits to have the money to do these repairs.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Machelle Wilson, Kiva

Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  \r\n"}},"status":"deleted","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":482005,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"Purchase of used clothes and shoes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Nkwen, Bamenda, NW Province","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"6 12","type":"point"}},"partner_id":40,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Formarah ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XAF","disbursal_amount":150000,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2010-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2010-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2010-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2010-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2010-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2010-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2010-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2011-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2011-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2011-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2011-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2011-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2011-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2011-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2011-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2011-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2011-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2011-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2011-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2011-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.83},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.84},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.83},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.83},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.84},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.83},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.83},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.84},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.83},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10.83},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10.84},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10.83},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10.83},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10.84},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10.83},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10.83},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10.84},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.83},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.83},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.84},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.83},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.83},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.84},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.83},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.83},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.84},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.83},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.83},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.84},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":173371,"name":"Mujeres Con Metas Y Sue\u00f1os 1 &2 Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Amada is the coordinator of her group Mujeres con Sue\u00f1os y Metas (Women with Dreams and Goals), and her story is representational of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican (many of whom recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti) clients in general.

Mr. Gerardo works for a hydroelectric dam, but due to increased layoffs at his job and a lack of resources at the business, a year and a half ago he decided to start his own business selling clothing for men, women, and children.  This clothing is imported from the United States and Gerardo sells it out of his home.  While Gerardo works at his other job during the week, his wife helps by running the business.  He is asking for a loan to be able to buy clothing in different sizes and colors, with the intention of improving earnings and attracting more customers.  The money is important to Gerardo because he pays for his merchandise in cash.  He comes with very good references for being a very responsible father and worker who is always willing to provide a better life for his family.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

B. is single and has two children. She has no educational background herself. She sells kenkey at Elmina, which she has been doing for some time now and uses her income to pay school fees and utility bills.\r\n\r\nTo prepare her kenkey Mary buys maize from the market and soaks it in enough water to soften the maize. She washes it on the third day and sends it to the mill to be milled. She then makes a mixture of dough out of the milled wet corn, leaving it to prove (rise) on the next day. She divides the proved dough in two, uses one part for her firm half-cooked dough (she mixes it with water to get it in a porridge form and cooks it for some time to get a firm mixture or texture) and mixes the rest of the uncooked dough with the half-cooked dough.

She has a store selling perishable basic needs items.  Even though she has had the business for several years, she has not been able to stock it with all of the necessary products, which people buy more frequently.\r\n\r\nThat is the reason that Mar\u00eda is asking for a loan.  It will allow her to buy products like detergents, meat, sausages, and other things.  Being able to stock the store is very important to Mar\u00eda because that is the way she gets more money.  She gives her husband the much needed help to pay their expenses.  This is because their children are adults, and they have their own jobs.  In spite of this, Mar\u00eda works a lot to have better economic stability together with her husband.  \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

Ricardo has a carpentry business which is located in his home.  In this business, he makes furniture made of wood which has been ordered in advance by his customers.  Thanks to his extensive work experience, Jose has many customers who are satisfied with the work he does, recognizing him as a very hardworking and responsible man who always delivers his products on time.  In addition to making furniture, Jose also makes other types of decorative wood products, which he sells outside of his home.  He requests a loan so that he can buy wood at wholesale, and also parts for his work tools. In this way Joseph hopes to accept more work, since this is the only source of income that he has to support his family.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva

He lives in the German Pomares neighbourhood with his wife who sells perishables such as sweet peppers, onions, garlic, oranges, tangerines, and other items. \r\n\r\nOne son is at university studying law. Don Enrique has worked as a gardener for more than eleven years at the high school in the neighbourhood where he lives. He also works as a security guard when the high school guard is sick. At weekends he looks after a private house from which he gets further income. Money is important for Enrique because he wants his daughter to complete her professional studies so that she can have better opportunities in life. When you don\u2019t have an education, it is hard to get work.\r\n\r\nEnrique is renovating his house. With previous loans he painted the walls and also managed to build a wall which made the house safer and easier to keep clean. With this loan he wants to build a new bathroom and toilet as the current one is not in good condition. It is made of corrugated iron covered with sheets. For this reason he needs to build a concrete one for better hygiene and personal cleanliness. Enrique is very happy that he will be able to do this work. He plans to buy cement blocks, cement, and corrugated iron; he has already bought enough sand and other items to make a start. He is grateful for this opportunity provided by the institution.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jane Agg, Kiva

Together with his wife he works hard to improve their home. Jos\u00e9 works as a salesman for the Coca Cola company, traveling all over the capital to offer their products. His priority is to each day improve the house; with the previous loan he has succeeded in adding a room. Now he wants to plaster the walls, purchase secure doors, as the current ones are in poor shape, add a floor, as the current one is just dirt, and improve the decoration by painting. For these projects Jos\u00e9 will purchase construction materials like sand, cement, stone, flooring, and paint to begin. Only with this loan can he make these improvements, as his salary is minimal and he gets paid by commission. For this reason he leaves very early to work in the morning to earn a little more and thus be able to satisfy his family's needs, like a better home. He is succeeding with the help of Afodenic.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kevin Credo, Kiva

She was therefore asked to demonstrate how the Banku is prepared.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":482074,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"Mary will use the loan to purchase more maize for her banku business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GH","country":"Ghana","town":"Elmina","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"5.083333 -1.35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":91,"posted_date":"2010-02-02T17:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Mary ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GHS","disbursal_amount":400,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":66.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.01},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.99}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":66.67,"processed_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:44:41Z","rounded_local_amount":71.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128928346,"comment":null},{"amount":50.01,"local_amount":66.67,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-16T08:28:00Z","rounded_local_amount":71.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136655930,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":66.67,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-12T07:43:19Z","rounded_local_amount":71.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144688572,"comment":null},{"amount":100.01,"local_amount":133.34,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:53:41Z","rounded_local_amount":143.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151872027,"comment":null},{"amount":49.98,"local_amount":66.65,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-27T08:46:03Z","rounded_local_amount":71.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159611906,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-02-02T21:29:35Z","paid_date":"2010-10-27T08:46:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":173417,"name":"Imelda Pastora","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Imelda Pastora tiene 52 a\u00f1os, por lo que  su actividad econ\u00f3mica es una librer\u00eda.

R. lives with her family in La Suiza de Turrialba, a quiet and tranquil region near Costa Rica\u2019s central valley. Priscila is 25 years old and is currently in her 3rd year at \u201cThe University for Distance Education\u201d (UNED) studying to become a preschool teacher.\r\n\r\nA goal of Priscila\u2019s is to be able to contribute to her family\u2019s income in a significant way, as does her brother. Priscila aspires to open her own business selling clothes in an effort to gain financial independence and to finance her university costs (books, tuition, transportation, etc.). Priscila has developed her sales experience by assisting a colleague with her business.\r\n\r\nThis will be Priscila\u2019s first loan with Fundacion Mujer. This loan will be used to make initial investments in clothing products to be sold in her community and at university. She will purchase clothes from a store in nearby Cartago (an hour from Turrialba) to sell in La Suiza. Priscila is confident in her estimation of potential earnings to be sought via sales to neighbors, friends and acquaintances.\r\n\r\nAs a full-time student, most of Priscila\u2019s day is spent in classes; however, she plans to dedicate at least three hours after class every day to her business. Priscila says that for business advice, she consults her mother or sister.\r\n\r\nPriscila has been studying part-time to become a preschool teacher since 2003. For financial reasons, she wasn\u2019t able to afford enrollment in a full-time schedule. Recently she has been granted a scholarship with UNED which she will use to enroll in full-time studies. Every fifteen days she must travel to Turrialba (thirty minutes by bus) to attend university - the rest of her classes she takes on the Internet. Part of her motivation to become a teacher stems from the fact that she has always liked caring for children.\r\n\r\nPriscila is a hardworking, determined and competent woman. With limited time, she skillfully balances her schedule: Tuesdays and Thursdays she spends working at a local day care; the rest of her time is divided between studying and babysitting her 8-year-old niece. Priscila also loves to play volleyball; she used to have more time to devote to her sport on a competitive team but recently it has become more of a hobby.

Puerto is 55 years old. She lives in the San Jacinto Municipality, in the Bolivar region. Fanny has three children between the ages of 28 and 37. In her area, a number of women make crafts such as traditional woven hammocks, backpacks and purses. Their spouses usually do farm work. Fanny is no exception; she crochets backpacks, and she also has a dressmaking business, which is why she has applied for a loan. She plans to invest in fabric for school uniforms; she wants to be able to take advantage of the start of the school season. Fanny would also like to buy more yarn for woven backpacks. \r\n\r\nFanny has been working since she was quite young. She learned how to use sewing machines in a convent school, and has been using them in her work for about 35 years. She lives with her husband, a field worker, and two of their grandchildren. Fanny and her husband are providing their grandchildren with an education, because their own children need to live and work elsewhere. In addition to school uniforms, Fanny makes men's and women's clothing. When the demand for tailoring is low, she takes advantage of her weaving and crochet skills by producing and selling bags and purses. She comes up with creative designs in order to keep people interested in buying her bags.  \r\n\r\nFanny started working with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation in 1996. She was part of a group that received a substantial loan. Since then, she has received individual micro-loans. \"My family's standard of living has been greatly improved by my income,\" she says. She's grateful to be working with the Foundation, which has given her the opportunity to work independently and support her grandchildren. Fanny is a credit to her family, and she has the support of her neighbours in hard times, too. They recognize the value of her work. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Corinne Gilroy, Kiva

By doing this he will be helping not only his family, but his workers' families as well, he says.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About U.S. Microfinance and ACCION USA:<\/b>\r\nHave you ever thought about how the cute new caf\u00e9 on your corner or the salon you frequent every month got the financial resources to start their business? Chances are, they drummed up support from their friends and family, dipped into their personal savings, used a high-interest credit card, or all of the above. An estimated ten million small businesses in the U.S. face difficulty obtaining loans from traditional banks, even prior to the current \u201ccredit crisis\u201d. Microfinance institutions, like ACCION USA, support these \u201cunbanked\u201d small businesses by giving them access to fairly-priced capital and business education.\r\n\r\nSmall businesses also help stabilize low- to moderate-income neighborhoods and rebuild our economy through income growth and job creation. Self-employment provides workers with a way to increase their incomes, support their families, and strengthen their communities. As unemployment rises in the U.S., more and more people are turning to self-employment and start-up enterprises as a way to take control of their economic futures and provide employment opportunities in their communities. The need for support of small businesses in the U.S. is great, and it is one that ACCION USA has been striving to meet since 1991.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2275,"image":{"id":482172,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction

She is 34 years old. She is a Khmer cheese seller and her husband, Mr. Sovanaret Ouy, is a farmer who owns a small piece of land to cultivate rice, both of whom are supporting their family living. This family has some problem because Mrs. Van Norn Y. must sell Khmer cheese far from her local village but she did not have a motorbike for transportation to support it moreover she has a little money to buy a new motorbike.
