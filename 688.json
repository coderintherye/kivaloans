Mrs. Sok wishes to build a bigger house for a comfortable living yet she does not have enough money to buy a plot of land for that purpose. That is why Mrs. Sok would like to borrow some funds from Kiva, through HKL.

It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 350 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 24,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMa. Consuelo hopes her business grows into a mini-grocery and dreams to be able to give her children a good future through all her hard work in her business.  She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She earns a minimum of 800 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 9,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nRosalinda hopes her business grows into a mini-grocery and dreams of having other stores in their area.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nNoselyn operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 400 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 22,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nNoselyn hopes her business grows in the coming years and and dreams of being able to give her children a good and high-quality education through all her hard work on her business.  She faithfully meets with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week, where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nPinky operates a buy-and-sell business. What she basically does is buy general merchandise from wholesalers and sell them with a little profit. She sells footwear, like sandals and other similar products. Customers are attracted to buy due to the low selling prices and the many options she offers. Aside from this, she sells cooked viands (savory dishes) for added income.  Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She makes a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP10, 000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities and varieties of sandals, slippers, and other footwear to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands.  \r\n\r\nPinky dreams to have a bigger store in the future and hopes to give her child a high quality education through all her hard work in her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Her future plan, if all works out the way she wants it to, is to buy herself a house, no matter how small.

She lives in Malindi town of the Coastal Province, Kenya. \r\n\r\nJosephine joined Milango in April, 2011, after an invitation from a friend. Her major challenge comes from her supply business where payments are made on a monthly basis. A loan of 60,000 Kenyan shillings will help Josephine restock her business with retail stock like soap, sugar, flour, oil, etc. Josephine intends to faithfully repay her upcoming loan, so she can obtain higher credit and establish a salon and a boutique. This loan will also help her obtain additional income to carry out farming on the piece of land she bought using her first loan. She hopes Milango partners, especially KIVA, will support her with credit for her upcoming businesses.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":212.5,"image":{"id":891336,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to
