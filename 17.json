All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. <\/p>\r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/em><\/p>\r\n<h4>Economy of Baba<\/h4>\r\n<p>The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana-producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large multinational companies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by small and informal farms. <\/p>\r\n<p>Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soybeans as secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. <\/p>\r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia<\/h4>\r\n<p>Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water-intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. <\/p>\r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n<p>One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution.\r\nBecause people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. <\/p>\r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4>\r\n<p>The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province \u201cLos Rios\u201d (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain, there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soybeans. <\/p>\r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4>\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will mostly be used to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p>\r\n "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":25965,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Romulo would like to invest in some feed for his livestock and machinery that will help him be more effective in planting his rice","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Baba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.783333 -79.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-04-13T00:40:56Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Romulo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-04-28T13:34:24Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-06-18T19:20:20Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T21:16:31Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":24201,"comment":"1er pago asociaci\u00f3n montubios progresistas"},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-07-20T17:12:49Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T21:16:31Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":33942,"comment":"2do pago montubios progresistas"},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-08-20T18:15:29Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T21:16:31Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44790,"comment":"3er pago montubios progresistas"},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-10-25T17:28:11Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T21:16:31Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":71885,"comment":"4TO PAGO MONTUBIOS PROGRESISTAS"},{"amount":816,"local_amount":816,"processed_date":"2008-01-03T21:16:31Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T21:16:31Z","rounded_local_amount":816,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":107737,"comment":"PAGO MONTUBIOS PROGRESITAS"}],"funded_date":"2007-04-14T13:34:24Z","paid_date":"2008-01-03T21:16:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":8118,"name":"Rosenie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p>Rosenie started to utilize her skills cooking to support her and her daughter after she was unable to find a job elsewhere.

was born and raised in Baba where he has spent his life working in agriculture. He never had the opportunity to go to school, but through hard work he has been able to send some of his kids to school. Despite his age, he still works the fields and makes his land produce great rice. He hopes with the loan he will be able to be more effective. <\/p>\r\n<h4>Communal Banking in Baba<\/h4>\r\n<p>This borrower is part of the newest and largest Communal Bank in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. <\/p>\r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/em><\/p>\r\n<h4>Economy of Baba<\/h4>\r\n<p>The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana-producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large multinational companies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by small and informal farms. <\/p>\r\n<p>Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soybeans as secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. <\/p>\r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia<\/h4>\r\n<p>Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water-intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. <\/p>\r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n<p>One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution.\r\nBecause people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. <\/p>\r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4>\r\n<p>The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province \u201cLos Rios\u201d (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain, there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soybeans. <\/p>\r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4>\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will mostly be used to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves.

He and his family of four children all still live on the farm. He works the fields with his sons, one who is pictured, and they all share in the profits. He also grows watermelons, maize and green peppers on his farm. He will be very happy to receive a loan and hopes he can invest in fertilizers and pesticides to nurture his crops. <\/p>\r\n<h4>Communal Banking in Baba<\/h4>\r\n<p>This borrower is part of the newest and largest Communal Bank in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. <\/p>\r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/em><\/p>\r\n<h4>Economy of Baba<\/h4>\r\n<p>The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana-producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large multinational companies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by small and informal farms. <\/p>\r\n<p>Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soybeans as secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. <\/p>\r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia<\/h4>\r\n<p>Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water-intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. <\/p>\r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n<p>One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution.\r\nBecause people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. <\/p>\r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4>\r\n<p>The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province \u201cLos Rios\u201d (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain, there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soybeans. <\/p>\r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4>\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will mostly be used to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves.

He has lived in Baba, Ecuador for his entire life working in agriculture. His education is very limited, but he has been able to raise two children through his rice cultivation. He has over 35 years of experience with this crop and he now has the help of his two sons who work with him. He is planning to use the loan to invest in pesticides and fertilizer for his land. <\/p>\r\n<h4>Communal Banking in Baba<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>This borrower is part of the newest and largest Communal Bank in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector. \r\n\r\n<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/em><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Baba<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana-producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large multinational companies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by small and informal farms. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soybeans as secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Baba<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water-intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution.\r\n\r\nBecause people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province \u201cLos Rios\u201d (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain, there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soybeans. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will mostly be used to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves.

He has lived in Baba, Ecuador for over 30 years where he has made a living growing rice. Although his children are all grown up, they all work the fields together in order to make ends meet for the family. On his farm Ramon also raises plantain trees and a few other secondary crops. <\/p>\r\n<h4>Communal Banking in Baba<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>This borrower is part of the newest and largest Communal Bank in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector. \r\n\r\n<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/em><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Baba<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana-producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large multinational companies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by small and informal farms. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soybeans as secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Baba<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water-intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution.\r\n\r\nBecause people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province \u201cLos Rios\u201d (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain, there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soybeans. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will mostly be used to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan.

Esteban's age, he still works the lands that were given to him by his father. He is a rice farmer in Baba, Ecuador where he was born and raised. He has had two children, both of whom are grown up and independent. He lives on his farm with his wife and together they make ends meet through rice production. He hopes he can invest the loan by acquiring fertilizers that will help his crops grow better. <\/p>\r\n<h4>Communal Banking in Baba<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>This borrower is part of the newest and largest Communal Bank in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector. \r\n\r\n<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/em><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Baba<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana-producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large multinational companies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by small and informal farms. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soybeans as secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water-intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution.\r\n\r\nBecause people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province \u201cLos Rios\u201d (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain, there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soybeans. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will mostly be used to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":25992,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Rice farming","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Baba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.783333 -79.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-04-10T15:58:49Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Esteban","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-04-26T18:02:50Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1075,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2007-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2007-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2007-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2007-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2007-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":179.15}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":179.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":86,"local_amount":86,"processed_date":"2007-06-16T17:01:38Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-23T17:27:19Z","rounded_local_amount":86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":23693,"comment":"1er pago asociaci\u00f3n el anzuelo"},{"amount":86,"local_amount":86,"processed_date":"2007-07-17T21:40:49Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-23T17:27:19Z","rounded_local_amount":86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":33127,"comment":"2do pago asoc el anzuelo"},{"amount":823,"local_amount":823,"processed_date":"2007-12-18T18:25:12Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-23T17:27:19Z","rounded_local_amount":823,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":99069,"comment":"6to pago"},{"amount":80,"local_amount":80,"processed_date":"2008-02-23T17:27:19Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-23T17:27:19Z","rounded_local_amount":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":140968,"comment":"PAGO DE EL ANZUELO"}],"funded_date":"2007-04-12T18:02:50Z","paid_date":"2008-02-23T17:27:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":8137,"name":"Toeaso","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"From the Samoan village of Elise Fou, Toeaso operates a restaurant catering drinks and baked goods at the local Savalalo market.

is a rice farmer from Baba, Ecuador, a sector known for its rice cultivation. He has only had his farm for several years, but it is serving well to feed his wife and his infant child. He wants to invest the loan received in improving his crop output. He hopes to buy more seeds, fertilizer and pesticides. His long term goal is to improve his home for his growing family. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Communal Banking in Baba<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>This borrower is part of the newest and largest Communal Bank in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector. \r\n\r\n<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/em><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Baba<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana-producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large multinational companies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by small and informal farms. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soybeans as secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Baba<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water-intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution.\r\n\r\nBecause people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province \u201cLos Rios\u201d (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain, there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soybeans. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will mostly be used to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":25995,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Rice Farming","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Baba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.783333 -79.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-04-13T04:45:01Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alfredo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-05-01T22:02:33Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1075,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2007-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2007-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2007-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2007-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2007-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.15}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":179.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":86,"local_amount":86,"processed_date":"2007-10-25T23:40:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-14T16:44:40Z","rounded_local_amount":86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":71902,"comment":"1er pago el anzuelo"},{"amount":909,"local_amount":909,"processed_date":"2007-12-18T18:22:17Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-14T16:44:40Z","rounded_local_amount":909,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":99064,"comment":"6to pago el anzuelo"},{"amount":80,"local_amount":80,"processed_date":"2008-05-14T16:44:39Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-14T16:44:40Z","rounded_local_amount":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":210200,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2007-04-17T22:02:33Z","paid_date":"2008-05-14T16:44:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":8139,"name":"Fausto","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p>Fausto was born and raised in Baba, Ecuador where he has grown up cultivating rice.

So far, her children have done well in school but saving enough for their school fees and supplies is nearly impossible for her and her husband.  \r\n<p>\r\nRosa took out an initial loan from SPBD in order to start up a small village store in her home.

Having paid back the first loan, Rosa is requesting additional loan funds in order to re-stock her shop and build walls at the corner of her house where she is selling.  This will enable her to ensure the store goods remain dry and can be locked up to prevent theft.

is married. She brings her goods from Khujand and Istaravshan which is about a 1-2 hours drive from her town. She makes this trip once a week. <p>Kimyu says that if she had more money she could have bought more goods on each trip and save time and money for the road. <p>She has been receiving loans starting 2003. Her first loan was $80. When she learned that she needs to form a group of entrepreneurs like herself for a solidarity group guarantee, she asked her friends from the same market to join her and they started receiving loans together. Since then, her business has developed dramatically. Now she sells not only female clothes, but added men's and children's clothes. Since Kimyu works in open-air market, she dreams of having her own shop. The next loan will be used for a trip to the wholesale market.

is a very strong-willed person, someone who has found ways of overcoming the problems and obstacles with which she has been confronted in her life. She comes from a family of farmers and as a young person tried in many ways to advance herself and to reach for a better life. After graduating from the high school in her region, she entered the university in the nearby city of Cahul, but having had limited financial support from her parents she was unable to finish her studies. \r\n<p>\r\nShe began working as a sales person at the outdoor market as an employee of a business owner. The income which she was receiving was very small and was enough only to meet the most basic needs. Two years ago she decided to try something else and applied for a permit to open a small business, rented a place in the market and started to work independently.

She has a sharp business mind and has been able to gradually grow her operation into a successful enterprise. An outstanding client with Nadiya Ukraine, she has repaid a total of 17 loans to date. \r\n\r\nLidiya has requested a loan that will add to her available working capital.

Her oldest son, Keni (17) assists her after school by looking after his two younger siblings, Sandra (12) and Luis (8) while their mother works. This loan will allow Sara to have the capital she needs to invest in developing her business. Right now she has limited resources and a small inventory, but her business plan and training that she went through with Esperanza has prepared her to move ahead in her business growth process with this first loan.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Sara is one of 5 micro-entrepreneurs in her Bank of Hope solidarity group, which have all gone through Esperanza's business training courses and will be accountable to each other for repaying their shares of this $1,000 loan together. If a member is unable to pay in full on time, the group is responsible for making up the deficit before a payment can be made. Investors in this loan will receive an update on Sara's progress as well as that of the entire group. This group-lending method strengthens social needs in a community and ensures that members cooperate to help one another repay their loans and invest wisely in their business and family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":26280,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase clothing as well as coffee, fruit, beans and rice","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"DO","country":"Dominican Republic","town":"San Pedro de Macor\u00eds","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"19 -70.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":44,"posted_date":"2007-04-11T21:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-04-26T02:59:23Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2007-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2007-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2007-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2007-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2007-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":166.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":166.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":167,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2007-05-26T09:18:38Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-26T09:22:28Z","rounded_local_amount":167,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":17486,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":167,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2007-06-26T09:19:45Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-26T09:22:28Z","rounded_local_amount":167,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":26296,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":167,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2007-07-26T09:20:51Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-26T09:22:28Z","rounded_local_amount":167,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35686,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":167,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2007-08-26T09:22:05Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-26T09:22:28Z","rounded_local_amount":167,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":46647,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":167,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2007-09-26T09:21:31Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-26T09:22:28Z","rounded_local_amount":167,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":58925,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":165,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2007-10-26T09:22:28Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-26T09:22:28Z","rounded_local_amount":165,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":72242,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2007-04-12T02:59:23Z","paid_date":"2007-10-26T09:22:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":8346,"name":"Const\u00e2ncia Jos\u00e9","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Const\u00e2ncia Jos\u00e9 C., 27 years old, native of Bilene, Province of Gaza.

Sok Sa Roeun has repaid the Kiva loan early! Kiva and CREDIT MFI make every effort to be as transparent as possible so you can trust the information we give you. In this case, we didn\u2019t let you know that the loan had been repaid at the time. Occasionally, when a loan is repaid early, the payment schedule posted on Kiva doesn\u2019t always match the records of our micro finance partner in Cambodia, CREDIT MFI. As in life, the system doesn\u2019t always run perfectly, but when there is a discrepancy we will alert you as soon as possible so you have all the information about your investment.\r\n\r\nOn the upside, the issue occurred because the client\u2019s business is so successful! Your loan made that possible. Soon you will see a repayment posted on the client\u2019s profile that is larger than the usual amount. This will end the loan and return the funds to your account. We hope you will choose to loan the repaid funds to another entrepreneur who would a like a chance to grow their business as well. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please post them as a comment on this borrowers site and I will be happy to respond. I also encourage you to write comments on the pages of your loan recipients so we can pass along your good wishes to the borrowers.\r\n\r\nWe sincerely apologize for the oversight and are putting policies in place to make sure that it doesn\u2019t happen again.

Kiva Lender,\r\n\r\nGreat news! Sout Sovorn has repaid the Kiva loan early! Kiva and CREDIT MFI make every effort to be as transparent as possible so you can trust the information we give you. In this case, we didn\u2019t let you know that the loan had been repaid at the time. Occasionally, when a loan is repaid early, the payment schedule posted on Kiva doesn\u2019t always match the records of our micro finance partner in Cambodia, CREDIT MFI. As in life, the system doesn\u2019t always run perfectly, but when there is a discrepancy we will alert you as soon as possible so you have all the information about your investment.\r\n\r\nOn the upside, the issue occurred because the client\u2019s business is so successful! Your loan made that possible. Soon you will see a repayment posted on the client\u2019s profile that is larger than the usual amount. This will end the loan and return the funds to your account.

Seang Soeun has repaid the Kiva loan early! Kiva and CREDIT MFI make every effort to be as transparent as possible so you can trust the information we give you. In this case, we didn\u2019t let you know that the loan had been repaid at the time. Occasionally, when a loan is repaid early, the payment schedule posted on Kiva doesn\u2019t always match the records of our micro finance partner in Cambodia, CREDIT MFI. As in life, the system doesn\u2019t always run perfectly, but when there is a discrepancy we will alert you as soon as possible so you have all the information about your investment.\r\n\r\nOn the upside, the issue occurred because the client\u2019s business is so successful! Your loan made that possible. Soon you will see a repayment posted on the client\u2019s profile that is larger than the usual amount. This will end the loan and return the funds to your account. We hope you will choose to loan the repaid funds to another entrepreneur who would a like a chance to grow their business as well. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please post them as a comment on this borrowers site and I will be happy to respond. I also encourage you to write comments on the pages of your loan recipients so we can pass along your good wishes to the borrowers.\r\n\r\nWe sincerely apologize for the oversight and are putting policies in place to make sure that it doesn\u2019t happen again. Thank you for giving poor entrepreneurs in Cambodia a chance at success! \r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nSopheap Khiev, Kiva partnership coordinator, Cambodia\r\nMr. Chan Mach, General Manager, CREDIT MFI, Cambodia\r\n"}],"funded_date":"2007-04-13T02:31:03Z","paid_date":"2008-03-04T03:31:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":8428,"name":"Shahnoza","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shahnoza has been engaged in trade for 4 years.

The first loan was 80 dollars, and she spent it for an assortment of goods as she did before. As her work experience and credit increased, she increased the size of the loan. Currently, she has applied for $500 dollars. Since she started receiving loans, the assortment of goods that she sells has increased twice.

For a while she worked as a trolley-bus controller selling tickets to passengers. She also worked part-time as a market vendor. However, Galina wanted to be self-employed, so six years ago she decided to start her own business. Today she has four market vending facilities \u2013 two selling dishware sets and ceramics, and two locations selling clothing and shoes. She has hired several employees who help her with sales. \r\n<p>\r\nGalina realizes that lending services have been the engine pushing her business forward. The seventeen loans she has received and repaid from \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d have helped her business grow. With financial assistance Galina was able to purchase two more vending facilities and hire two people to work for her. Currently, she has about $8,000 in inventory. Her monthly gross revenue amounts to $2,000.\r\n<p>\r\nGalina has requested a loan of $1,200 to open her fifth vending facility and start selling dishware and ceramic goods in a new location. She is planning to buy tableware, dinnerware and porcelain sets at wholesale prices that she can re-sell in her new kiosk. Galina is hoping that the expansion of her trade will help her meet high demand for dishware and boost her sales.  \r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\u0413\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u2013

has a small indoor kiosk where she offers a nice selection of kitchen ware, dishes and utensils. Originally, Vartiter trained to be a journalist. She has a degree from the prestigious Shevchenko University in Kiev, which is one of the best schools in Ukraine. Like many trained Ukrainian professionals, however, Vartiter now works as a market vendor due to a lack of good paying professional jobs.\r\n<p>\r\nAfter working for a time as a leather goods specialist, Vartiter started her current business, which she has now operated for several years. Nadiya Ukraine has previously assisted her with four different loans. She has requested an additional loan of $1000 for two purposes. She needs to purchase additional inventory for her current business, and she would also like to use some money to help open a second sales kiosk where she could begin selling clothing items. She is hoping that by expanding her overall business enterprise and moving into a new area of retail she will be able to increase her income and improve her standard of

Goal-oriented, hard-working and punctual, he is a natural business man. Funding from \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d has been instrumental in helping Vitali build his business. His first loan was for $500 and since that time he has benefited from nine additional loans while establishing a great credit history.\r\n<p>\r\nHe has requested $1200 to add to his available working capital. The ability to purchase large quantities of inventory in bulk saves time and expense for merchants such as Vitali. He would like to buy a supply of men\u2019s sportswear and men\u2019s and women\u2019s jean clothing that will boost his inventory before the busy summer season. Vitali appreciates the availability of funding through Nadiya Ukraine. It allows him to take advantage of good opportunities and focus on growing his business so that he is able to adequately provide for himself and his

and his wife Ludmila are a husband and wife business team. Together they successfully manage a little grocery kiosk at one of the local markets in Nikopol. Both Zachar and Ludmila have higher educations but instead of directly applying their schooling, they decided to become business owners. Their family also consists of a little boy whom they love and nurture. \r\n<p>\r\nIt has been Zachar and Ludmila\u2019s desire to operate their business profitably and see it fully sustain their family. Today, they are seeing stability in their work and good returns. They would like to expend their grocery line in order to meet customer demand and generate additional profits. While both of them devote most of their time to their grocery kiosk, Ludmila has begun an additional business selling water filters. The couple is hopeful to see this venture take off in the future.  \r\n<p>\r\nThrough several years of partnering with \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d, Zachar and Ludmila have proven themselves to be responsible, goal-oriented and hard-working entrepreneurs. Today, they are asking for a $1,000 loan to assist them in expanding the food items they have available in their busy grocery kiosk.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\u0417\u0430\u0445\u0430\u0440 \u0437

you\u2019re a woman looking for shoes, clothing or something to decorate your home or dining room, make sure to stop by Evgeniya\u2019s little store in Nikopol, Ukraine. She offers an attractive array of reasonably priced shoes, clothing, tablecloths and souvenirs. If she doesn\u2019t have what you\u2019re looking for, she can help you find someone who does.\r\n<p>\r\nVendors like Evgeniya form the backbone of a prosperous market economy in Ukraine. These entrepreneurs have, often with little help, been able to start and sustain small businesses which provide enough income for them to live on. For many their goal is to expand by opening new kiosks or renting larger retail space. They may never be the size of Wal-Mart but they\u2019ve started in much the same way. \r\n<p>\r\nEvgeniya has requested a six month loan for $500 which will give her some additional working funds for her business. She believes that God has blessed her through the financial help of \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d. Thank you for being part of God\u2019s blessing to the hard-working entrepreneurs of Ukraine.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\u042f\u043a\u0449\u043e \u0432\u0438 \u0448\u0443\u043a\u0430\u0454\u0442\u0435

Heng Srey Mom has repaid the Kiva loan early! Kiva and CREDIT MFI make every effort to be as transparent as possible so you can trust the information we give you. In this case, we didn\u2019t let you know that the loan had been repaid at the time. Occasionally, when a loan is repaid early, the payment schedule posted on Kiva doesn\u2019t always match the records of our micro finance partner in Cambodia, CREDIT MFI. As in life, the system doesn\u2019t always run perfectly, but when there is a discrepancy we will alert you as soon as possible so you have all the information about your investment.\r\n\r\nOn the upside, the issue occurred because the client\u2019s business is so successful! Your loan made that possible. Soon you will see a repayment posted on the client\u2019s profile that is larger than the usual amount. This will end the loan and return the funds to your account. We hope you will choose to loan the repaid funds to another entrepreneur who would a like a chance to grow their business as well. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please post them as a comment on this borrowers site and I will be happy to respond. I also encourage you to write comments on the pages of your loan recipients so we can pass along your good wishes to the borrowers.\r\n\r\nWe sincerely apologize for the oversight and are putting policies in place to make sure that it doesn\u2019t happen again. Thank you for giving poor entrepreneurs in Cambodia a chance at success! \r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nSopheap Khiev, Kiva partnership coordinator, Cambodia\r\nMr. Chan Mach, General Manager, CREDIT MFI, Cambodia\r\n"}],"funded_date":"2007-04-14T22:09:05Z","paid_date":"2008-03-04T02:48:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":8570,"name":"Khudoikul","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Khudoikul D. is a member of the group \u201cFarz\u201d.

She is single and lives in District 8 of Kabul City. She has studied up to secondary school after which her family didn't give her permission to study further. She wanted to complete her education and after that assist her family financially, but quiting education halted her dreams. Still, she didn't lose hope and started a shared business with her brother who runs a carpentry shop. At the start of her business she and her brother faced lots of problems because they didn't have enough money to purchase all the carpentry materials.

Pharm Tihiv has repaid the Kiva loan early! Kiva and CREDIT MFI make every effort to be as transparent as possible so you can trust the information we give you. In this case, we didn\u2019t let you know that the loan had been repaid at the time. Occasionally, when a loan is repaid early, the payment schedule posted on Kiva doesn\u2019t always match the records of our micro finance partner in Cambodia, CREDIT MFI. As in life, the system doesn\u2019t always run perfectly, but when there is a discrepancy we will alert you as soon as possible so you have all the information about your investment.\r\n\r\nOn the upside, the issue occurred because the client\u2019s business is so successful! Your loan made that possible. Soon you will see a repayment posted on the client\u2019s profile that is larger than the usual amount. This will end the loan and return the funds to your account. We hope you will choose to loan the repaid funds to another entrepreneur who would a like a chance to grow their business as well. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please post them as a comment on this borrowers site and I will be happy to respond. I also encourage you to write comments on the pages of your loan recipients so we can pass along your good wishes to the borrowers.\r\n\r\nWe sincerely apologize for the oversight and are putting policies in place to make sure that it doesn\u2019t happen again. Thank you for giving poor entrepreneurs in Cambodia a chance at success! \r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nSopheap Khiev, Kiva partnership coordinator, Cambodia\r\nMr. Chan Mach, General Manager, CREDIT MFI, Cambodia\r\n"}],"funded_date":"2007-04-14T21:05:06Z","paid_date":"2008-03-04T02:37:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":8586,"name":"Noorullah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Noorllah was born in 1982, lives in district 8 of Kabul, and is married.

Kiva Lender,\r\n\r\nGreat news! Chea Rotha has repaid the Kiva loan early! Kiva and CREDIT MFI make every effort to be as transparent as possible so you can trust the information we give you. In this case, we didn\u2019t let you know that the loan had been repaid at the time. Occasionally, when a loan is repaid early, the payment schedule posted on Kiva doesn\u2019t always match the records of our micro finance partner in Cambodia, CREDIT MFI. As in life, the system doesn\u2019t always run perfectly, but when there is a discrepancy we will alert you as soon as possible so you have all the information about your investment.\r\n\r\nOn the upside, the issue occurred because the client\u2019s business is so successful! Your loan made that possible. Soon you will see a repayment posted on the client\u2019s profile that is larger than the usual amount. This will end the loan and return the funds to your account. We hope you will choose to loan the repaid funds to another entrepreneur who would a like a chance to grow their business as well. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please post them as a comment on this borrowers site and I will be happy to respond. I also encourage you to write comments on the pages of your loan recipients so we can pass along your good wishes to the borrowers.\r\n\r\nWe sincerely apologize for the oversight and are putting policies in place to make sure that it doesn\u2019t happen again. Thank you for giving poor entrepreneurs in Cambodia a chance at success! \r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nSopheap Khiev, Kiva partnership coordinator, Cambodia\r\nMr. Chan Mach, General Manager, CREDIT MFI, Cambodia\r\n"}],"funded_date":"2007-04-15T05:37:47Z","paid_date":"2008-03-04T02:27:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":8588,"name":"Khiev","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Khiev N. sells perfume at the local market in Phnom Penh.

Kiva Lender,\r\n\r\nGreat news! Khiev Nary has repaid the Kiva loan early! Kiva and CREDIT MFI make every effort to be as transparent as possible so you can trust the information we give you. In this case, we didn\u2019t let you know that the loan had been repaid at the time. Occasionally, when a loan is repaid early, the payment schedule posted on Kiva doesn\u2019t always match the records of our micro finance partner in Cambodia, CREDIT MFI. As in life, the system doesn\u2019t always run perfectly, but when there is a discrepancy we will alert you as soon as possible so you have all the information about your investment.\r\n\r\nOn the upside, the issue occurred because the client\u2019s business is so successful! Your loan made that possible. Soon you will see a repayment posted on the client\u2019s profile that is larger than the usual amount. This will end the loan and return the funds to your account. We hope you will choose to loan the repaid funds to another entrepreneur who would a like a chance to grow their business as well. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please post them as a comment on this borrowers site and I will be happy to respond. I also encourage you to write comments on the pages of your loan recipients so we can pass along your good wishes to the borrowers.\r\n\r\nWe sincerely apologize for the oversight and are putting policies in place to make sure that it doesn\u2019t happen again. Thank you for giving poor entrepreneurs in Cambodia a chance at success! \r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nSopheap Khiev, Kiva partnership coordinator, Cambodia\r\nMr. Chan Mach, General Manager, CREDIT MFI, Cambodia\r\n"}],"funded_date":"2007-04-14T22:42:17Z","paid_date":"2008-03-04T03:15:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":8589,"name":"Kuch","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kuch S. is 46 years old and works 3 jobs--she is a teacher, a grocer, and a kitchenware saleswoman.

Zbirnea and his wife, Vera are a young family.  Together they have four children and live in the regional center of Orhei.  Ruslan has been worried for some time about not being able to provide for his family and realized the only way to make a sustainable future for his family was to start his own business.  Ruslan comes from an agricultural background yet he has no land to start a farm.  After studying different possibilities he has decided to start growing mushrooms.  Growing mushrooms requires very little land and the initial investment is reasonable which makes it an ideal micro business startup for any entrepreneur.

Kiva Lender,\r\n\r\nGreat news! Cheng Sokry has repaid the Kiva loan early! Kiva and CREDIT MFI make every effort to be as transparent as possible so you can trust the information we give you. In this case, we didn\u2019t let you know that the loan had been repaid at the time. Occasionally, when a loan is repaid early, the payment schedule posted on Kiva doesn\u2019t always match the records of our micro finance partner in Cambodia, CREDIT MFI. As in life, the system doesn\u2019t always run perfectly, but when there is a discrepancy we will alert you as soon as possible so you have all the information about your investment.\r\n\r\nOn the upside, the issue occurred because the client\u2019s business is so successful! Your loan made that possible. Soon you will see a repayment posted on the client\u2019s profile that is larger than the usual amount. This will end the loan and return the funds to your account. We hope you will choose to loan the repaid funds to another entrepreneur who would a like a chance to grow their business as well. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please post them as a comment on this borrowers site and I will be happy to respond. I also encourage you to write comments on the pages of your loan recipients so we can pass along your good wishes to the borrowers.\r\n\r\nWe sincerely apologize for the oversight and are putting policies in place to make sure that it doesn\u2019t happen again. Thank you for giving poor entrepreneurs in Cambodia a chance at success! \r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nSopheap Khiev, Kiva partnership coordinator, Cambodia\r\nMr. Chan Mach, General Manager, CREDIT MFI, Cambodia\r\n"}],"funded_date":"2007-04-14T07:37:10Z","paid_date":"2008-03-04T02:42:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":8598,"name":"Roth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Roth P. is 40 years old and lives in Phnom Penh with his wife, Leng Vichet.
