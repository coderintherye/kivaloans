When he started out, he did it with money lent at a high cost, little merchandise, and buying things with high turnover that sold quickly because he had to pay quickly. Almost all of his earnings wound up in other people\u2019s hands. His wife has been his greatest strength. Without her he couldn\u2019t have gotten his work done, because she has helped him in his work, while he simultaneously also works in bricklaying and motorcycle mechanics, among other things that he has learned and which have generated income that have been important for growth. He is now requesting a Kiva loan, his first loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, which he will use to buy grocery items that will diversify his inventory and will guarantee a permanent inventory for responding to his customers\u2019 requests; they often leave dissatisfied because Jader doesn\u2019t have things in his store and this is a big challenge, as is not having sufficient capital.

With this business he was able to generate enough income to cover his personal and household expenses, because he was unemployed. Right now the leather products are shipped to him but he plans on traveling there directly to study the possibilities of new suppliers and obtain special discounts and better commercial transactions. At present, he is applying for a new Kiva loan, the first loan he has taken out from the  Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. With it, he will buy shoes, briefcases, bags, wallets, backpacks, belts and sandals for men. He has a lot of orders from his best customers, whom he wants to keep by responding to them quickly with products of incomparable quality, so this investment will be successful.

When she prepared her home two years ago she started a business of decorating shoes with jewels.  She buys them in the center of the city, decorates them, and sells them.  Her clientele has been gradually building between relatives, neighbors, and friends who refer new customers to her.\r\n\r\nShe sells for cash, and she handles a small credit portfolio.  Her goal for later on is to have her own house.  In order to do so she tries hard every day to achieve, through her work, the success of her business. \r\n\r\nShe currently needs working capital to buy slippers, sandals, sweaters, and bermudas.  She will also buy imitation jewels to use as decorative accessories that she will apply to all of these products in order to respond to her growing clientele.  That is why she turns to a Kiva loan, which is her first loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.\r\n\r\nWith the loan she will produce new and creative designs to impact her customers.  She will awaken their attention, interest, and desire.  Then they will buy.  She hypothesizes that this investment will be successful because of her experience in developing the technique and the exclusivity that she generates for each customer upon wearing her goods.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1045913,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","use":"to buy slippers, sandals, sweaters, bermudas, and imitation jewels to make decorative accessories to apply to these items.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad Atl\u00e0ntico","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-03-24T16:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-23T16:10:02Z","loan_amount":325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shirly   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":550000,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":40245},{"due_date":"2012-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":41184},{"due_date":"2012-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":42145},{"due_date":"2012-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":43128},{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":44134},{"due_date":"2012-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":45164},{"due_date":"2012-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":46218},{"due_date":"2012-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":47296},{"due_date":"2012-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":48400},{"due_date":"2013-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":49529},{"due_date":"2013-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":50685},{"due_date":"2013-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":51872}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.78},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.34},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.9},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.49},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.07},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.69},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.31},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.95},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.6},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.27},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.95},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-03-24T17:25:35Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":406684,"name":"Mercedes","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mercedes is 43 years old and lives in the Philippines.

He lives with his wife, who sells new clothing for a living. Mario has worked as a locksmith\u2019s assistant for a year and is quite enterprising. He is thinking about opening his own locksmith business in the future. \r\n\r\nMario tells us that when he came to live here his wife had very little merchandise. During the first few years she just worked as a clothing sales assistant and wasn\u2019t able to start her own business because she didn\u2019t have the necessary capital. But she saved up gradually and learnt about the clothing retail business so that she could later start a business in this area.

Her regular customers are her neighbors and members of the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a PHP 8000 loan. She will use the loan to pay for the maintenance of her video\/karaoke machine and tricycle units. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nEdwina hopes her business grows more in the coming years and dreams to be able to give her children a high-quality education through all of her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and to draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1052470,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Machinery Rental","sector":"Services","use":"To pay for spare parts and maintenance for her karaoke machine and tricycles","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Bacoor, Cavite","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-03-25T14:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-24T14:40:02Z","loan_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Edwina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":533.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-03-25T15:22:24Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":407279,"name":"Mila","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mila is married and has four children.
