Her gross income is about $1600 a month.\r\n\r\nNadezhda is a wonderful wife and the mother of two children. She handles all household chores and keeps up with her intense business pace incredibly well. The secret of her success is her natural liveliness and willingness to be a hands-on manager of her enterprise.

The first loan he took out was a consumer loan to buy a television set and stand for his home.  Having successfully repaid it without problem, he decided to once again obtain a loan.  He plans to spend his next loan on the purchase of small livestock, sheep and goats.  He explained he wants to increase the size of his flock to fatten next season for sale.  Sulton really loves caring for sheep.  At present he has six in his flock.

She has been married to Hober Salom\u00f3n since she was 18, and she\u2028has 8 children. Four of them are students and the other four have independent jobs.  She buys animals and sells their meat, and thanks to Banco\u2028Progresistas (a local bank), she learned to be independent and run the business alone instead of depending on her husband as she did before. When she received her first loan of 300 soles, she invested\u2028it very carefully.  She bought pigs, made a profit, and went on to working alone. She was able to repay the loan in four months. With this loan of 1,500 soles, to be repaid in four installments, she will buy a cow and retail sell its meat.  She works for the local soup\u2028kitchen Coraz\u00f3n de Mar\u00eda and is member of the Banco\u2028Comunal Progesistas. Her dream is for Manuela Ramos to keep growing so that the organization can grant her bigger loans.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by PULP Translators, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":206904,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase of cattle (a cow).","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Mache - La Libertad","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.033333 -78.533333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2008-10-06T20:20:29Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yolanda Elsa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-20T23:48:19Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2008-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2009-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":375}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":375,"processed_date":"2008-11-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T07:56:25Z","rounded_local_amount":390.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5330964,"comment":null},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":375,"processed_date":"2008-12-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T00:51:48Z","rounded_local_amount":390.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9951334,"comment":null},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":375,"processed_date":"2009-01-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T13:47:12Z","rounded_local_amount":390.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10224361,"comment":null},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":375,"processed_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T19:49:12Z","rounded_local_amount":390.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20417093,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-10-06T23:48:19Z","paid_date":"2009-03-16T19:49:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":66770,"name":"Sarah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p>Sarah K. operates a grocery store in her neighborhood.

She is 33 years old, and the mother of three children; two of whom are attending the local school. Her youngest child is only three years old, and thus too young to study or work. The village bank, which is comprised of seventeen members, is located in Tuol Sralau Village in Kampong Chang Province. \r\n\r\n<p> Mrs. Un H. is also a farmer in the local village, where she owns a 1.5 hectare rice field. Presently, however, she faces a small problem in her field, as she needs fertilizer, which is quite expensive. Her husband, Mr. Choem Hoeun, is a motorbike taxi driver who can make US $2.5 per day. He also helps his wife in the field, but their income is small for their family. As a result, Un is asking for a loan to purchase fertilizers in order to produce better crops.\r\n\r\n<p>This is a village bank loan consisting mainly of end-of-term loans. Eight members have end-of-term loans, and the rest have monthly payment loans. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK's main product, because they are the most beneficial to Cambodia's poor. This type of loan allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to do so. These members are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term, but most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK's clients make their payments on time. AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09%, and AMK has a default rate of 0% on Kiva loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2050,"image":{"id":207075,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To

Phon Ry Village Bank Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The Village Bank, located in Damank Ampil Village in Kampong Cham Province, consists of fourteen people who plan to use the loan for different purposes. Mrs. Phon R. is the village bank president. She is a 50-year-old mother of two children: one of whom is a construction worker, while the youngest is enrolled in the local school. She is also a farmer who owns a two hectare field. She faces a small problem in her plantation, because she does not have enough money to hire a laborer with two oxen to plow her field. Thus, she is requesting a loan in order to pay for this service. With the remainder of the loan, she will buy fertilizers and pesticides to support her crops and make them more productive. Her husband, Mr. Leng Luy, helps his wife on the plantation. The five men shown in the picture above are representing their wives, who are also requesting loans, but who were busy at work and unable to have their photo taken.\r\n \r\n<p>This is a village bank loan consisting entirely of end-of-term loans. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK's main product, because they are the most beneficial to Cambodia's poor. This type of loan allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to do so.

Q. is a hard-working man who graduated from class twelve last year, and started a small business with a lot of dreams.  Q. is 23 and single. He and his family have been living in the Behsood district for about 6 years. Before that they were living in Pakistan as refugees.\r\n\r\nSaid Q. has two brothers and a sister, who are studying at a public school.  His father had a small retail shop in the Behsood bazaar, but recently he has been faced with some serious illnesses, so doctors recommended that he rest at home for a few months. This was the reason that Q. accepted all responsibilities and started working in his father's shop.\r\n\r\nHis shop is near a public school, and he sells different goods, such as milk, shampoo, pens, and juice.  His daily income is just 150 Afghanis (US $3), not enough to support his his family. So Said Q. has decided to expand his business. He thinks that if he purchases some stationery to sell, he will attract more customers and thus solve his financial problems. Therefore, he has requested an individual loan of 50,000 Afghanis (US $1075) for 12 months. He also has 25,000 Afghanis of his own capital.\r\n\r\nQ. hopes to stand on his own feet as soon as possible, and then start his remaining education in his spare time.  He also wants to help his father get well, and he doesn't want his siblings to stop their studying for any reason. Finally he expresses his appreciation to the lenders who assist poor people through a hard situation."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":207103,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase

Everyday, she buys scraps and discarded materials from other families inside and outside her village, then categorizes and sells them. This requires much time and effort, so usually, her husband and her children help her. Her children also transport and sell the materials. Thus, her family's daily income is from 180,000VND to 200,000VND (about 11USD to 12USD). Mrs. Soi likes to borrow through the SEDA Fund because she is allowed to repay the loans on an installment basis, as well as borrow regularly with no collateral required. Besides, she can also save some money to financially help her children and her grand children. This time, she would like to borrow 3,186,000VND to expand her inventory so that she can purchase more scraps and discarded materials.

Besides running this business, he sells rice-bran powder in the local village. Since this business is flourishing, he wants to expand it. He has decided to ask for a loan to buy more rice-bran powder to re-sell to his consumers who breed pigs. His wife, Mrs. Pich Bopha, is pig breeder who raises five pigs.

This member is not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK's main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia's poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to. Most clients start to make payments months before the end of the loan term.

They get their supplies locally at the marketplaces of Oueless\u00e9bougou and its surrounding areas for n\u00e9r\u00e9 seeds (from a tree that is a source of oil in sub-Saharan regions).

The end-of-term loan members are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term loans are AMK's main product because they are the most beneficial loans for Cambodia's poor. EoT loans allow people to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK's clients make their payments on time.

Mrs Yorn T. is 51 years old and the mother of a child who is attending the local school. She has a plot of land to cultivate vegetable and she now faces a problem because she does not have enough money to purchase vegetable seeds to grow on her field. Thus, Mrs Yorn T. is requesting a loan to deal with this purpose. Her husband, Mr Suon San, is a bodyguard in one hotel in Phnom Penh city, Cambodia. He can make around $42 per month which is little income to support his family.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is a village bank loan consisting mainly of end-of-term loans. Eight members have end-of-term loans and the rest have monthly payment loans. Those members receiving end-of-term loans are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term.\r\n<p>\r\nEnd-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK's main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia's poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term.

She has two children, one of whom is attending the local school while the younger one is too young to work or study because that child is only four years old. <P>\r\n\r\nEach week, Mrs. San K. makes approximately US$ 35 in income and with the extra income from this loan she hopes to be able to meet the needs of the family and improve their living conditions. The two men shown in the picture came to take a loan instead of their wives because their wives were busy with their work. All the members are shown in the picture except one who is blocked.<P>\r\n\r\nThis is a village bank loan consisting of a number of end-of-term loans. Seven members have end-of-term loans and the rest have monthly payment loans. These members are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK's main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia's poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK's clients make their payments on time. AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09% and AMK has a default rate of 0% on

He uses a walkie-talkie to help him facilitate his work and get to a pick-up a lot faster. \r\n\r\nViktor has been in this business for 6 years. His determination and strong will to succeed have helped him keep his business stable and sustainable and have promoted its expansion. Currently, his daily income is about $30-40. Viktor would like to get a loan for 3400 Grivnas to make repairs to his car. One of his other plans is to eventually repay a loan for his vehicle. We are confident that the modesty, diligence and responsibility that have helped Viktor develop his venture and gain a good reputation among other taxi drivers will help him promptly repay this loan and allow him to succeed in his business endeavors."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":207521,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","use":"To repair

She studied up to 7th grade, then had to interrupt her studies because of an early pregnancy.  She is a widow and mother of 4 daughters, between the ages of 18 and 25 years old.  The oldest is employed, and the other three are in secondary school.  <P>\r\n\r\nAna lost her partner in a car accident in 1990 when they were prepared to get married.  After this tragedy, life was difficult.  He had left her with four children to raise and without a house of their own.  They had been living in a house granted through his job, and after his death they had to vacate the house.  Her parents took her in for three years, and because she was the wife of a state employee she received an indemnity benefit and a house.  In 1993 she took a poultry-raising course for six months at the community center in Namaacha.  Then with the money she had received from the indemnity benefit and monthly pension of 2,700 meticais (MZN), she started raising chickens, which she has continued until today.  She has an average of 300 chickens; spends 18,000MZN; profits 7,500MZN; is able to save 2,000MZN; and rents a chicken coop for 500MZN.  Now she is responsible for no one else besides her daughters.  <P>\r\n\r\nThis is Ana\u2019s third loan and first one with Kiva.  She used the first loan of 15,000MZN and the second of 25,000MZN to buy chickens and feed, and this third loan of 15,000MZN also will be used for the same purpose.  In the future she intends to request more loans to build her own chicken coop and become a great chicken farmer.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by April Newman, Kiva

Quiteria graduated as a high-school teacher. When she was taking classes, she had no other option but to move in with her uncle in Naamacha.It was located closer to the school grounds, in a village near Swaziland's border, and she wouldn't have to endure the wearisome trip of 16 kilometers each way to reach it. After graduating from the high-school teacher's program, she started to work at the Irm\u00e3s (Sisters) School. She moved out from her uncle's home when she got married and became a permanent employee with a regular schedule from 8:45am to 12:00pm. Her monthly salary is 3.374.00 MT. Quiteria started a clothing retail business so she could keep up with increasing living costs that her salary alone was not covering anymore. During winter time, women's jackets sell strong and they are purchased at a price of 1.000R (3.500.00MT) for a dozen and sold for 350.00MT each, bringing in monthly 4.000MT in profits -- from that amount she is able to save 1.000MT, which helps pay her elderly mother's care giver salary of 500.00MT.  This will be the first loan Quiteria requests from Hluvuku through Kiva and it will be used to stock up merchandise. Her friend's accomplishments achieved with loans from Hluvuku motivated her to apply for her own. As a goal, she wants to pay back the loan within its term duration so that she can request a second loan that will be used to finish up improvement work to her home at the 16th kilometer in Boane. <br

He is married and the father of 2 daughters.  The first is 6 years old, and the second is 2.  Only the oldest is in school.  Jose moved to Namaacha, a town on the boarder of Swaziland, searching for a job at his aunt's company who already lived in that district.  Jose came to Namaacha in 1997 and stayed at his aunt's house.\r\n\r\nHe has worked in a restaurant for 2 years and receives a monthly salary of 250MT, but because the income does not satisfy his necessities he started his own business with the earnings from his 2 years of work.  He started selling rolls and cellphone refills on the boarder.  He works from 7:00am to 8:00pm when the boarder closes.  His business has good results.  Jose already has his own home where he lives with his family.  Jose's best product are the refills that he buys for 15MT, 45MT, 74MT and 90MT and sells fo 20MT, 50MT, 80MT, and 100MT consecutively.\r\n\r\nHe has a monthly income of 3000MT and is able to save 500MT.  He helps his grandfather who is in Homoine by sending him a box of soap, 50kg of rice, and 25kg of sugar every 6 months that corresponds to 1,500MT.\r\n\r\nThis is the first loan for Jose with Hluvuku and Kiva for the amount of 12,000MT.  He intends to increase the volume of his merchandise to satisfy the necessities and demands of his clients.

He was born in Namaacha, in a district on the border of Swaziland.  He studied through tenth grade, then had to stop because work did not allow him to continue attending school.  <P>\r\n\r\nHe left his parents\u2019 house when his oldest sister got a house and asked him to take care of it.  Because he did not work at that time, his sister gave him a monthly allowance of 250 meticais (MZN).  He grew more responsible and always wanted to be independent, so he secured a job at a small restaurant, where he worked for three years.  His sister found him a better position at the Libombos Hotel, in the department where she was an accountant.  It required, however, an education through at least tenth grade, and he had studied through only eighth grade at that time.  So he asked his boss if he could continue his studies, and his boss denied his request, arguing that the job he was doing did not allow him to study.  In 2000 Clemencio left that job and resumed his studies.  Completing tenth grade, in 2003 he began to work as a receptionist, which he continues today.  He is a regular employee, works from 7am to 7pm, and makes 4,000MZN per month.  He has taken responsibility for his twin sister and his nephews and nieces, buying them uniforms and their necessary school materials.  He manages to save 1,000MZN per month, as he does not have children and lives with his girlfriend.  <P>\r\n\r\nThis is Clemencio\u2019s second loan with Hluvuku (Kiva\u2019s Field Partner) and his first with Kiva.  He used the first loan of 20,000MZN to buy construction materials for his house, and he repaid the loan on time.  He requests this second loan of 20,000MZN to finish this work.  His goal is to see this building completed and to request a new loan to furnish it.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by April Newman, Kiva
