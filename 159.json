The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions.

Her little store is very crowded, thanks to her attentiveness, and this brings her a good income--above all, from the phone service, which is useful to everyone. The difficult part is stocking her store with the diverse products that people ask for, which are expensive. This is her first loan from MFP. Elsa wishes to increase her product stock to satisfy her customers' needs, for which she will invest 1000 soles.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Trisha Bury, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":238001,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"Increase the merchandise for sale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-12-16T05:20:51Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elsa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":165}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.6}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":54.28,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-01-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:03:51Z","rounded_local_amount":167.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10228136,"comment":null},{"amount":54.28,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:02:04Z","rounded_local_amount":167.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20423368,"comment":null},{"amount":54.28,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:32:50Z","rounded_local_amount":167.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116630,"comment":null},{"amount":54.27,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:42:29Z","rounded_local_amount":167.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011561,"comment":null},{"amount":54.28,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:58:45Z","rounded_local_amount":167.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595195,"comment":null},{"amount":53.61,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:38:18Z","rounded_local_amount":165.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989382,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-12-16T19:00:21Z","paid_date":"2009-07-15T22:38:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":79160,"name":"Evilia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Evilia tiene 56 a\u00f1os, es casada, vive con su esposo y sus dos hijos.

Their principal crops are maize (corn), hot peppers, vegetables, okra, tomatoes, and manioc which are staple foods in Benin. The problem for these people who dwell along the river is that when the river is in flood, they have no more work and spend all the money they earned during the last farming season on foodstuffs.

Since she was twelve, she never missed the fairs of her city as this is where she earns her living selling all types of condiments in small bags to the local housewives.  This activity helps her meet her living expenses, since she sells every week, and she enjoys offering her products although it would be more practical to have a stable location from which to sell her merchandise.  But, thanks to God she tells us, sales of condiments are always good because not many people offer them.  In addition, they are inexpensive and selling them at retail is profitable.  Regardless, it is difficult to walk constantly and be exposed to the sun all day.  This is her first loan with MFP.  With the funds she is requesting, she will increase her supply of products.

She also sells fish.<P>\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of this village work as farmers when the river level is low. Their land is rich and gives them a good harvest. Their principal crops are maize (corn), hot peppers, vegetables, okra, tomatoes, and manioc which are staple foods in Benin. The problem for these people who dwell along the river is that when the river is in flood, they have no more work and spend all the money they earned during the last farming season on foodstuffs. When the waters recede, they have no money left to pay for laborers who are indispensible to them in sowing their land. <P>\r\n\r\nThe custom of borrowing against the new harvest does not make them more secure and indeed leaves them worse off. They sell their future harvest at a laughable price to weathier persons so that they have the cash needed to do their farming.

She was kidnapped and taken to Nigeria by a crook and there she had to work for a \"pagne\" (lengths of brightly colored African cloth) and cloth seller. She remained in captivity for 5 years before being found by her parents and brought back to Benin. <P>\r\n\r\nAfter her return, she began by selling small items, thanks to her father's help: soaps, tins of sardines, sugar, etc. She gave this up and began to sell used clothing 15 years ago. Today, she has a working capital of about 200,000 F CFA. But this does not allow her to completely satisfy her clientele's needs. That is why she is requesting this, her second loan of 100,000 F CFA so as to consolidate her capital. Married, she has two children: Enoch and G\u00e9d\u00e9on.  d<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":238171,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":" buying 1\/2 bale of used clothing of various types ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Cotonou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.35 2.433333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2008-12-11T21:00:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sylvie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":100000,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T09:37:40Z","rounded_local_amount":12900.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14821595,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:37:26Z","rounded_local_amount":12900.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20357867,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:31:43Z","rounded_local_amount":12900.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27046917,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T10:19:22Z","rounded_local_amount":25800.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35938533,"comment":null},{"amount":8.8,"local_amount":4400,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:48:10Z","rounded_local_amount":4540.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44396193,"comment":null},{"amount":41.2,"local_amount":20600,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T17:07:52Z","rounded_local_amount":21259.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52904075,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-21T07:47:00Z","rounded_local_amount":12900.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63126085,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-12-12T01:12:33Z","paid_date":"2009-08-21T07:47:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":79250,"name":"Julia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Julia, desde hace 6 a\u00f1os, es socia del Banco Comunal \u201cMujeres al progreso de Juli\u201d.

Just like the rest of the group she shows responsibility, which is why she has the confidence of the rest of the group. The majority of the members are dedicated to selling products like clothing, food, drinks, perfumes, chocolate, and cosmetics, while some of the members are dedicated to activities like home schooling, electric work, and domestic services. All of their sales take place in the central market, where there is lots of competition, but they know how to succeed since they have experience in their businesses. The loan financed through Agrocapital will be used to increase their business with products and materials to sell as well as purchasing work tools. The members don't have experience with solidarity groups since this is the first time they have obtained financing through this method, but they know each other and know that they are working with

was born on April 8th, 1968, and he is married to Victorine Ijang. They are blessed with three children only one of whom is under 15 years of age. As a hard-working young man, he has faced some major challenges in life such as the death of his mother, poor health, dropping out of school and inadequate funds to continue his business. Because of all these challenges, Andrea later found GHAPE as a source of relief in 2005. In that same year, he received his fist loan of 20,000FRS, then 45,000FRS in the year 2006, and 100,000FRS in the 2008. With all these loans, his repayments were done promptly.\r\n\r\nWith the new loan, he plans to buy piglets for 100,000FRS, one month old chicks for 100,000FRS, and he will use his personal contribution of 50,000FRS to buy seedlings for gardening. Andrea will start repayment at the fourth month from the day of loan disbursement. He plans to use the profit from the loan to educate his children, expand on his business, and buy for the children\u2019s needs. The business of Andrea will help his community by providing organic manure to them for crop cultivation and provide vegetables to the community. He is convinced the business will succeed because of the experience he has as far as the business is concerned, and he has a ready market to supply his product. \r\n\r\nAndrea prefers to take a loan from GHAPE because the method of repayment is good and comfortable for him, and proper follow-up is being done to ensure the loan is properly managed. \r\n\r\n---\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.

She later married and was blessed with two children, though her husband died.  As a widow, she has struggled to raise money and care for her children, making life very difficult for her.  In the year 2007, Margaret found GHAPE and enrolled herself in the program.  She was first given a loan of 40,000 FRS, and she managed to successfully pay off the loan promptly. \r\n\r\nMonica is now requesting a loan of 200,000 FRS, in which she plans to buy coco yams for \u201cachu\u201d production.  \u201cAchu\u201d is one of the most common foods in the Northwest region of Cameroon; it is produced from matched coco yams and is eaten with yellow soup.  She will spend her 200,000 FRS loan accordingly: 40,000 FRS for coco yams, 10,000 FRS for palm wine and 150,000 FRS for drinks.\r\n\r\nMonica promises to start repaying her loan the day it is disbursed. She is convinced her business will succeed due to her experience in the industry, the business location and customer loyalty.  Her business will also help the community by providing food for them at moderate prices, reducing their costs of living.\r\n\r\nMonica also promises to pay for her grandchildren's school fees, food for her family and needed medications with the profit from her business. She prefers to receive loans from GHAPE because no collateral security is needed in order for the loan to be disbursed.  Also, the repayment schedule is comfortable and convenient.\r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instils a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.  \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":238478,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":" Buying coco yams for \"achu\", palm wine, and beer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Ntahsen Market Square, NW.

is married to Nkain Cletus, and they are blessed with six children, two of whom are under 15 years of age. They live in a three-room house in Nanga-Street, in the Bamenda-NW region of Cameroon. Immaculate has decided to work extra hard to help her husband raise their large family. She has faced many challenges in life, including inadequate funding for her business and ill health. These challenges made life uncomfortable for her until Sept.18, 2007 when she discovered GHAPE and became a member. In that same year, Immaculate received her first loan, which she has successfully repaid. She plowed the profit she made right back into her business. \r\n<p>\r\nImmaculate will start repayments on this loan on the day it is disbursed.  She strongly believes that her business will succeed because of the way she approaches her customers, the way she displays her goods and the experience she already has in the business. She also is proud of the fact that her business helps her town by paying taxes that foster  economic growth. With the profit from the business, she plans to pay her children's school fees, and continue to expand her business. She prefers to receive loans from GHAPE because of the education it offers, and because the method of repayment is convenient\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":236017,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"To buy corn, beans and groundnut for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Food-Market, Bamenda, NW.

Presently, this business and raising farm animals are their main sources of income. With the next loan, she wishes to borrow 600 USD to purchase additional lumber for her carpentry business\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by Thu

In the 7 years of participating in the Fund, Mrs. N. used the loan to invest in her livestock and tree farming ventures.  Besides that, her family also bought a milling machine to grind rice as a service for the local townspeople.  Currently with an income of 6,000,000 VND\/month from raising livestock and grinding rice, the family's quality of life is gradually improving.  In this round of funding she would like to borrow 15,000,000 VND to invest in buying harvested rice to process into edible rice in order to increase the family's income.<br \/><p><strong>Translated

She joined the Fund in 1996 and borrowed money to invest in raising livestock and selling clay pots.

Besides that, her family also has a monthly income from her husband's salary as a security guard, so her family's finances are very secure with an income of 6,000,000 VND\/month.

She joined the Fund in 1999.  Currently her family's main source of income is raising livestock and farming trees.  Besides that the family also has an income from fishing and crabbing, so their finances are becoming more stable day by day.  Thanks to a monthly income of 6,000,000 VND\/month, Mrs. V. and her family are much more able to improve their quality of life and pay for their children's schooling.  In this round of funding she would like to borrow 15,000,000 VND to invest in materials to renovate the livestock pen and buying more pigs to raise.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese

Currently her family's main source of income is trading and selling general goods and raising livestock with an income of 3,000,000 VND\/month.  Besides that main business, her husband also works as a construction worker so the family has a supplemental income of 3,000,000 VND\/month.  With this stable income, the family's quality of life is improving day by day.  Mrs. N. would like to borrow 10,000,000 VND in this round of funding to invest in buying more goods to serve the demands of her customers in the upcoming Tet New Year's holiday.  \r\n<br

However, his child is growing and he is expecting another child, so covering family needs has become harder. Rovshan is applying for a loan of 1200 USD to expand his activities and to purchase more sheep.

She is married and her husband works as a mason.  They have three lovely children, ages 14, 21 and 24; only the youngest is still in school.  For the past four years, Janett has worked in a small kiosk at a school in the capital, selling soft drinks and fritanga, a fried meal including meat and vegetables. Janett plans to finish the construction of her house in order to provide security and protection for her family.  Since her house is made of zinc-coated corrugated metal sheets, Janett wants to buy construction materials such as stone, cement, sand, iron, roof purlins, etc., in order to start construction.  Her dream is to see her home finished in an acceptable manner. Business-wise, she hopes to attract new customers, market new products and expand the kiosk.  Thanks to loans from Afodenic, she will achieve an increase in sales, and thus provide a better standard of living for her family.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Joyce ., Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":238727,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction Supplies","sector":"Construction","use":"Purchase of construction materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:47Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Janett Concepcion","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":10000,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2009-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2009-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2009-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2009-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2009-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2009-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2009-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2009-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.12}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.36}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":58.56,"local_amount":1115.42,"processed_date":"2009-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T09:22:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1159.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14816748,"comment":null},{"amount":58.11,"local_amount":1106.8,"processed_date":"2009-02-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:21:12Z","rounded_local_amount":1150.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20351428,"comment":null},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":1111.11,"processed_date":"2009-03-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:06:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1154.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27038766,"comment":null},{"amount":58.43,"local_amount":1113.14,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T09:47:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1157.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35929065,"comment":null},{"amount":59.11,"local_amount":1125.82,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:25:44Z","rounded_local_amount":1170.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44383983,"comment":null},{"amount":58.99,"local_amount":1123.67,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T16:32:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1168.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52890450,"comment":null},{"amount":58.62,"local_amount":1116.57,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T09:39:08Z","rounded_local_amount":1160.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63111752,"comment":null},{"amount":56.49,"local_amount":1076.35,"processed_date":"2009-08-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T09:43:42Z","rounded_local_amount":1118.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73533178,"comment":null},{"amount":58.36,"local_amount":1111.12,"processed_date":"2009-09-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T09:51:18Z","rounded_local_amount":1154.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86964572,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-01-05T04:10:57Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T09:51:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":79495,"name":"El Tiluchi Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"EL GRUPO \"EL TILUCHI\" ESTA REPRESENTADO POR EL SE\u00d1OR NELSON QUE AL IGUAL QUE SUS COMPA\u00d1EROS RESID.

She really enjoys this activity and is planning on expanding her business, motivated by her wish for a better life and to help the last of her children finish his education.  \r\n\r\nThis is her fifth loan with Kiva partner MFP.

Also, to improve her home because this benefits the family that is in the development process so they have a more promising future.\r\n\r\nHer work consists of managing a grocery store and it took her five years to become the owner of the business.  It is located at Calle 2 in Reparto Santa Lucia.  She started the business by selling food and sold tacos, enchiladas, fried plantains, gallo pinto (rice and black beans) and other items but felt obligated to leave this type of business due to the condition of her health.  It was then she decided to start the grocery business where she sells soft drinks, candies and small bags and that's how she started filling a shelf where she sold personal items and began to attract the attention of her clients.\r\n\r\nThe financial assistance is for business capital that she needs to invest more in staple items like rice, beans, cooking oil, soft drinks and chicken as they are the products that are sold the most during the holiday season, so she'll now be able to offer different products to her clients.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Hugh Yarbrough, Kiva

He has owned his business for 15 years, it is located in a mobile cart. He began this business by himself because Mr. Edgar has contacts in the watch business and this is how he obtained the experience in this field and decided to purchase the watches and sell them  to customers, and that's how he had this kind of business. The financing is for working capital that will be used for the purchase of more products because Mr. Edgar found it is more favorable to purchase in different regions such as Chinandega, Managua y Chichigalpa to satisfy the demand from his customers. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Helen Smith, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":238853,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Working Capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2008-12-19T12:30:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edgar Antonio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":10000,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":909.09},{"due_date":"2009-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":909.09},{"due_date":"2009-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":909.09},{"due_date":"2009-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":909.09},{"due_date":"2009-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":909.09},{"due_date":"2009-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":909.09},{"due_date":"2009-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":909.09},{"due_date":"2009-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":909.09},{"due_date":"2009-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":909.09},{"due_date":"2009-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":909.09},{"due_date":"2009-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":909.1}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":47.73},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":47.73},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":47.73},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.73},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.73},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.73},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.73},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.73},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.73},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.73},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.7}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":47.73,"local_amount":909.09,"processed_date":"2009-01-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T12:36:06Z","rounded_local_amount":944.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14858674,"comment":null},{"amount":47.73,"local_amount":909.09,"processed_date":"2009-02-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:40:13Z","rounded_local_amount":944.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20399929,"comment":null},{"amount":71.53,"local_amount":1362.43,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:37:31Z","rounded_local_amount":1416.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27091915,"comment":null},{"amount":23.92,"local_amount":455.75,"processed_date":"2009-04-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:37:19Z","rounded_local_amount":473.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35985312,"comment":null},{"amount":47.73,"local_amount":909.09,"processed_date":"2009-05-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:08:50Z","rounded_local_amount":944.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44445923,"comment":null},{"amount":47.73,"local_amount":909.09,"processed_date":"2009-06-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:39:02Z","rounded_local_amount":944.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52956570,"comment":null},{"amount":238.63,"local_amount":4545.46,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-16T18:00:54Z","rounded_local_amount":4724.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63173998,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

would like to sustain our business and somehow expand it in the future because it is my goal to help my husband in supporting the needs of our family, especially the education of our children,\u201d Milagros said.\r\n\r\nMilagros is helping her husband earn a living by collecting and selling firewood in their village.  During weekends, their children also help her collect wood. \r\n\r\nShe is married to Gaudencio, a driver in their area.  They are helping each other provide for the needs of their family, especially the education of their children who are still studying.  They are blessed with six: Ranmil \u2013 28 years old and a college undergraduate; Mila \u2013 22 years and a high school graduate; Myrr \u2013 20 years old and in the third year of college; Gaudencio Jr. \u2013 19 years, a vocational course graduate in automotive repair; Mae \u2013 14 years, in junior high school; and Ralph \u2013 13 years old and a high school freshman. \r\n\r\nMilagros wanted to become an entrepreneur but lack of capital prevented her from sustaining her wood business.  She has applied for a loan which she will use to compensate people who collect wood.  This will not only allow her to have enough wood to sell, but can also help her neighbors earn extra income.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":238456,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Timber

is Samuel Abdul M., age 36.  He was born in Magburaka town, Tonkolili District, in northern Sierra Leone. Abdul is married to a businesswoman and the two have four children. Three of his children are in primary school and one is in secondary school. Abdul runs a video center (a cinema with several 19\u201d televisions) where he shows movies and European soccer matches.   People of all ages come to watch Premier League, FA Cup, Carling Cup and European Championship Cup matches.  Once in a while, he\u2019ll also televise the German, Spanish and Italian league games.  He has never received a loan from SMT before, but is now applying for one to help him strengthen his business.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Abdul will make a great improvement to his operation. Currently, he is using two satellite dishes, but this is not enough. These dishes cannot show all of the above-mentioned matches. Abdul will therefore add some of his own savings to the money from the loan to buy a new satellite dish that can show all of the above-mentioned matches. He will travel to Freetown, about 240 miles round trip, to buy it. \r\n\r\nNot having the third dish has been Abdul\u2019s greatest challenge in his business. Many customers deserted him because of his inability to show all of the matches. But with this loan, and the dish that he\u2019ll be able to buy, he is optimistic that he will be able to regain all of his lost customers and even find some new ones. Many of the youths in town prefer his video center to others because of its convenient location in the center of town. In addition to having a good location, he is young and many youth like patronizing with him because of their similarities. Also, as chairman of the Motorbike Rider\u2019s Association, he is very popular among the many motorbike riders.\r\n\r\nWhen business improves for Abdul, he will be able to take good care of his family, pay school fees, and provide them with more food and clothing.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":238976,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Entertainment","sector":"Entertainment","use":"buying a third satellite dish for his video center","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Magburaka, Tonkolili","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"8.5 -11.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2008-12-16T05:20:48Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abdul","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":2000000,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":222222.22},{"due_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":222222.22},{"due_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":222222.22},{"due_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":222222.22},{"due_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":222222.22},{"due_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":222222.22},{"due_date":"2009-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":222222.22},{"due_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":222222.22},{"due_date":"2009-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":222222.24}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":81,"local_amount":240000,"processed_date":"2009-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-19T09:07:53Z","rounded_local_amount":243243,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14885067,"comment":null},{"amount":144,"local_amount":426666.66,"processed_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:44:08Z","rounded_local_amount":432431.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27128909,"comment":null},{"amount":74.99,"local_amount":222222.22,"processed_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:10:10Z","rounded_local_amount":225225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36025698,"comment":null},{"amount":186,"local_amount":551111.12,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T23:53:58Z","rounded_local_amount":558558.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53008502,"comment":null},{"amount":39.01,"local_amount":115555.54,"processed_date":"2009-07-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:22:20Z","rounded_local_amount":117116.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63230844,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":222222.22,"processed_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:37:24Z","rounded_local_amount":225225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73662616,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":222222.24,"processed_date":"2009-09-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:15:43Z","rounded_local_amount":225225.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87102851,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-12-16T17:20:06Z","paid_date":"2009-10-16T02:15:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":79560,"name":"Nicolas","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nicolas G. is 26 years old and widely thought of as very determined to fulfill his dreams for his family.

Learn to Grow is requesting a loan of Le 1,200,000 to further enable them to strengthen their businesses by buying more products to their sellable stock.\r\n\r\nIbrahim is the leader of the group. He is forty-three years of age. He was born in Robuya Romendeh, in the Port Loko District in northern Sierra Leone. He is married to a businesswoman and the two have five children. Four of their children are in secondary school and one in primary school. Ibrahim sells second-hand clothes, belts and several other items \u2013 like mints, sardines, drinks, cosmetics, cigarettes, etc. \u2013 in Makeni. He has been in this business for 20 years now.\r\n\r\nWith this new loan, Ibrahim will expand his business. He will be able to buy at least two bales of second-hand clothes. A bale of second-hand clothes will cost him anywhere between Le 350,000 and 400,000 in Freetown. Ibrahim\u2019s round-trip fare to Freetown costs him Le 30,000. He will use the balance of the loan to buy more of the articles he sells at his store.\r\n\r\nThe only challenge he faces in his business is the occasional slow rate of sales he encounters. Apart from this, things are going fine for him. He likes his business and enjoys doing it. \r\n\r\nMost importantly, the loan will enable Ibrahim and Fatmata to educate and feed their children.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":238982,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"purchasing second-hand clothes to sell ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Makeni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.883333 -12.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2008-12-16T05:20:48Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ibrahim ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatmata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":1700000,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":212500},{"due_date":"2009-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":212500},{"due_date":"2009-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":212500},{"due_date":"2009-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":212500},{"due_date":"2009-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":212500},{"due_date":"2009-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":212500},{"due_date":"2009-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":212500},{"due_date":"2009-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":212500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":71.88},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":71.87},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":71.88},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":71.87},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.88},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.87},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.88},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":71.88,"local_amount":212500,"processed_date":"2008-12-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T02:54:31Z","rounded_local_amount":215840.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9968684,"comment":null},{"amount":14.38,"local_amount":42500,"processed_date":"2009-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-19T09:07:23Z","rounded_local_amount":43168.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14885069,"comment":null},{"amount":201.25,"local_amount":595000,"processed_date":"2009-03-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:46:46Z","rounded_local_amount":604353.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27128911,"comment":null},{"amount":71.87,"local_amount":212500,"processed_date":"2009-04-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:14:03Z","rounded_local_amount":215840.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36025700,"comment":null},{"amount":158.13,"local_amount":467500,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T23:54:52Z","rounded_local_amount":474849.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53008504,"comment":null},{"amount":57.49,"local_amount":170000,"processed_date":"2009-07-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:23:37Z","rounded_local_amount":172672.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63230846,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-12-17T13:04:05Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T18:23:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":79565,"name":"Neiva","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Neiva R. is a hardworking mother of four who owns her own restaurant in Carabayllo, a northern suburb of Lima, Peru.

She has been in the business for over ten years now.\r\n\r\nWith this new loan, Zainab will expand her business. She will be able to buy items in bulk to add to her business. For example, she will now be able to buy one carton of cigarettes instead of one pack at a time.  She will travel to Freetown (240 miles r\/t) to purchase these goods. \r\n\r\nZainab thanks God that her business is doing fine. She will reinvest some of the income generated from the loan back into the business.  She will use the rest to take care of her children, specifically their education, food and clothing.

Some of the earnings are also used to maintain their corn and rice farming business.  <p>\r\n\r\nTo further sustain her store and farming business, Mildred is requesting a loan as additional capital with which she will buy more stocks to offer in her store.  The said amount will make her store profitable and hopefully enable her to convert it into a grocery store.  In this way, she can provide for the immediate needs of the people in the community and make it more convenient for them because they will not have to go to the market just to acquire their basic requirements.  <p>\r\n\r\nThrough the income from her business, Mildred is able to provide the medication for her eldest child who is suffering from lupus, a chronic auto-immune disease that can be fatal. She prays that they can prevail in their struggle and that her child will be cured.  She loves her family and becomes teary- eyed whenever she remembers her child's sickness.  According to Mildred, her child is strongly fighting her sickness and this gives her the strength to overcome it.  \r\n\r\n

Barangay in Tumauini, Isabela, is known for its clean and green project whereby all families are obliged to have their own backyard gardens, thereby promoting personal food security and productivity. <p>\r\n\r\nEsmeralda is married to Nelidoro, a house carpenter, and they are blessed with four children: Gema, 31, a college graduate; Chamie, 35, a college graduate; Rolly 40, an elementary graduate, and her eldest son Leslie, 41, also a college graduate.<p>\r\n\r\nEsmeralda is now requesting a loan to buy more sacks of rice for her business, as the commodity sells very quickly given the fact that most of the farms in the area grow only corn and tobacco. She hopes to expand her business in the future, dreaming of the day she will have her own stall beside their house from which she will sell large volumes of rice.

from Tanzana!  This is 34 year old Shani Y. from Mwanza. She is married with four children, between the ages of 4 and 15 years old. Shani Y. has been operating a caf\u00e9 business since 2002. The name of the caf\u00e9 is \"Mama Lishe\". A local restaurant or caf\u00e9 in Tanzania usually consists of a rough wooden table and some long wooden benches. The food is all-local; rice, ugali (a hot sticky dough, made from maize flour), plantain (a cooked savory banana), all served with beans, vegetables, meat, and a variety of sauces. She works at her business 12 hours a day, 7 days a week and is assisted by one employee. Shani Y. currently earns about 450USD from her business. She is requesting a loan of 425USD in order to buy beans, rice and vegetables. In the future, she plans to expand her business. Shani Y. thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":239576,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","use":"To buy supplies of beans, rice and vegetables","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-12-16T12:10:23Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-02-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:46Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436325,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:55:16Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130597,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:23:26Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027394,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:02Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613395,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:16Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010475,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:59Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232775,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:00Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664591,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-09-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:44:54Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105322,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:24:53Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022467,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:41:27Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103867717,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-12-16T15:44:45Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T14:41:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":79624,"name":"Dang Thi Kim Group","description":{"languages":["vi","en"],"texts":{"vi":"\u0110\u1eb7ng Th\u1ecb K. sinh n\u0103m 1969 ( m\u00e3 s\u1ed1 010105060014).

As a result, Victoria is able to earn approximately $200 from her business. She is now requesting a loan in the amount of $425 in order to buy more clothes for resale purposes. In the future, she plans to expand her business.

Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are not considered to be credit-worthy by financial institutions because they lack tangible assets that can serve as collateral. As such, low income women in Tanzania typically receive poor financial support and in turn only limited access to basic needs and services.

from Tanzania! This is Bibiana R., a 42-year-old woman from Mwanza. She is married and has two children, who are between the ages of 6 and 20 years old. <p>\r\n\r\nBibiana R. has been operating a clothing sales business since 2001. In particular, she sells both women's and men's clothes to her loyal customer base. She works at her business 12 hours per day, 6 days per week. As a result, Bibiana is able to earn approximately $200 per month from her business. She is now requesting a loan in the amount of $425 in order to increase her stock of clothes for resale purposes. Bibiana thanks you for your support! <p>\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA: SELFINA is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback micro-finance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are not considered to be credit-worthy by financial institutions because they lack tangible assets that can serve as collateral. As such, low income women in Tanzania typically receive poor financial support and in turn only limited access to basic needs and services. Fortunately, SELFINA has been a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women in Tanzania. Simply put, SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women through an arrangement called a sale and leaseback transaction. More specifically, when a client needs working capital, SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extends a loan to her to facilitate the transaction, and then leases the equipment back to her. As such, one of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use their equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":239628,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To expand her business by increasing her inventory of clothes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-12-16T18:30:39Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bibiana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-02-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:48Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436334,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:55:20Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130606,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:23:31Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027403,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:14Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613404,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:13Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010484,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:56Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232783,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:51:56Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664599,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-09-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:45:06Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105330,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:24:40Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022475,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:41:25Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103867725,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-12-17T16:34:01Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T14:41:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":79638,"name":"Mabe","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"\u201cIt hurts me so bad every time I have to say 'No' to my children when they ask me to buy something because I have nothing to give,\u201d says Mabe V., 35-year-old mother from San Roque, Zamboanga City.

(greetings!) from Tanzania! This is Debora B., a 27-year-old, single woman from Mwanza. Debora has been operating a poultry (kuku) sales business since 2006. Raising kuku--chickens in Swahili--is a popular micro-business in Tanzania, especially amongst SELFINA clients. Further, raising them for sale is a popular business in Tanzania for a number of reasons. First, they require little start-up capital: you can start with just one or two kuku and either add more as your business expands or wait for them to (naturally) multiply! Second, kuku do not need a great deal of space or any special facilities, so you can normally just let them run around your garden or compound. Third, kuku produce eggs while they grow, and the eggs can either be sold so as to provide a supplementary source of income or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein. She works at her business 12 hours per day, 7 days per week, thereby enabling Debora to earn approximately $90 per month from her business operations. She is now requesting a loan in the amount of $425 in order to expand and improve her chicken-selling business. In the future, she plans to open another poultry business around her home. Debora thanks you for her support! <p>\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA: SELFINA is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback micro-finance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are not considered to be credit-worthy by financial institutions because they lack tangible assets that can serve as collateral. As such, low income women in Tanzania typically receive poor financial support and in turn only limited access to basic needs and services. Fortunately, SELFINA has been a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women in Tanzania. Simply put, SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women through an arrangement called a sale and leaseback transaction. More specifically, when a client needs working capital, SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extends a loan to her to facilitate the transaction, and then leases the equipment back to her. As such, one of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use their equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":239632,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To expand and improve her chicken-selling business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-12-16T18:40:38Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Debora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-02-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:36Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436335,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:55:22Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130607,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:23:34Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027404,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:15Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613405,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:15Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010485,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:58Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232784,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:51:57Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664600,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-09-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:45:10Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105331,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:24:49Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022476,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:41:25Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103867726,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-12-16T20:04:54Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T14:41:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}}]}
