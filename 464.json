She is 54 and a widow who already has a grandson. Now she is an owner of a chemist\u2019s shop. The family budget enlarges with the help of a cattle-breeding business. Her son actively helps to run his mother's business. During the past two years, Ryskul has managed to buy furniture. In order to develop her business she needs to buy hay for cattle feeding. That\u2019s why she wants to get a loan. In the future, her plans include obtaining a new car. \n\nGulshat B., 36, is married. Her husband's profession is farming. Together, the couple has three children, all of whom are school pupils. Gulshat has chosen to work in the sphere of medicine; she works as a nurse in a hospital. But in order to cover family expenses, she has to earn money additionally by cattle breeding. Out of those proceeds, the family has managed to build a new house and to obtain a refrigerator and a washing machine. The loan's purpose is for stocking up hay for the winter. In the future, she is planning to buy a car.\n\nSaltanat U. has the status of the group\u2019s treasurer. She is 34 and a widow who has raised two sons by herself. Luckily, she gets material support from her brother and her older son. But after the big tragedy, her husband's death, she decided not to give up and she has opened a small shop. This business gives her 6000 soms per month. Moreover, Saltanat makes her bread by working as a mail carrier. She has managed to buy necessary household appliances: a clothes washer, a refrigerator and a vacuum cleaner. The loan's purpose is to increase cattle stock by obtaining more farm animals (2500 soms per animal).

She began her business because her parents taught her trading since she did not go to school.  Working 7 days a week and 9 hours a day, she earns about 2,650,000 Sierra Leonean leones (SLL) every month from this business. She needs a loan of 4,500,000 SLL.  \r\n\r\nYealie requires a loan in order to purchase more market basket, washing boards, rubber kettles, and sets of pans for resale. She hopes that this loan will enable her to increase her monthly profits by approximately 715,500 SLL. In the future, Yealie plans to make plenty of money to help her husband support their children and improve their business.

However, she works very hard to keep her business doing well. She is using her loan of 10,000 Kenyan shillings to buy more paraffin and charcoal to expand her business. In the future, she hopes to buy a pick-up for car rental. She is a very hardworking and humble lady.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":603424,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To

Saivali was born in 1965 and is married with five children. As an aspiring and hard-working man, he has always dreamed of achieving success in whatever he does. For the past five years, Saivali has been growing melon, watermelon and onion in his land. At the same time, he raises cattle. Saivali wants his children to get a good education, allowing them to have a better chance to succeed in the future. This is what makes his sacrifice worthwhile.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Yormahmad is 53 years old. He is married and has three children. Yormahmad is a market vendor. He has been selling fruit for eleven years already. During these years Yormahmad has acquired the knowledge and skills required for the business. For instance, he knows how to store the fruits so as to keep their marketable conditions and not to lose their taste and useful properties. \r\n\r\nHe sells fruit such as apples, peaches and pomegranates in the local central market. In the market he is known among people because of the attractive prices and his characteristic frendliness. All this allows Yormahmad\u2019s business to generate a considerable stable income for his family. \r\n\r\nDue to the current season, Yormahmad\u2019s goods are in high demand. For this reason he is planning to purchase more fruit for selling. He is requesting a loan of $1500 that will allow him to expand his business. Yormahmad thanks everyone for supporting him.  \r\n \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

V. is a married woman with two children who are seven and two years old. She hopes to provide them with a quality education to the university level. \r\n\r\nHer business is located at a very busy market known as Likoni in Mombasa, Kenya. Mombasa is part of the coastal region of Kenya and is well known for its many tourist attraction sites, including the white beaches of the Indian Ocean. She owns a general store in which she sells such items as kerosene, detergents, sugar, flour and others. She has been in this business for three years now and she has two employees. \r\n\r\nShe says that this business is profitable, but the major challenge she has is that some of her customers are not paying their debts as per agreement, making it hard for her to maximize profits.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Harriet who belongs to 'Great Hope' development group, Mukono, is uncompromisingly relentless as regards running her 5-year-old cosmetics  sales business in a way that she says will make her make more profit and above all establish a good reputation for her business. \r\n\r\nWith this sense of purpose she has made great strides in terms of attracting customers who range from low, middle to high income earners within her Kito locality, Mukono.

V. is a married woman who lives in Prk. Kalubihan, Brgy. Libertad, Escalante City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating a sari-sari (general) store  business.  Her husband Edgardo V., who is 43 years old, works as a truck driver to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have six children who range from an infant up to  20 years old. \r\n\r\nJocelyn joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1995 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 9 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Jocelyn has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 2,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 10th loan, she is borrowing PHP 17,000 which she intends to use as additional capital for her general store so that she can continue to save up for her children's education.  Jocelyn V. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. In the photo you will see Jocelyn with her baby. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Her husband Rodrigo, who is 41 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have seven children who are 6 to  16 years old. \r\n\r\nLuzminda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 13 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Luzminda has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 18,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 14th loan, she is borrowing PHP 19,500, which she intends to use to buy more fishing gear and additional hogs to raise so that she can continue to save up for the education of her children and support the family. Luzminda A. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\n In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

T. is a married woman who lives in  Brgy. 4, Sipalay City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating 3 business ventures:   Videoke rental,  coconut shell sales and fish vending. Her husband Jenises, who is 31 years old, works as a Security Guard to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have 3 children who are 8 to 10 years old. <p>\r\n\r\nJenelyn joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 11 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Jenelyn has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of  8000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 5000 PHP,  uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 12th loan cycle, she is borrowing 15000 PHP, with which she intends to purchase one more videoke machine.  This will increase her income and she will continue to save up for the future improvement of their house and the education of their children. Jenelyn T. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2005, and has improved her living conditions with the help of loans from NWTF and through her own efforts.

This will be her 6th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 13000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Lorna aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well being by following the Dungganon way. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

She also engages in agriculture, taking care of her lands where she plants potatoes, maize, peas and broad beans. Sometimes her son helps her taking care of her animals while she sells beer. She says this activity helps her facing her financial problems, as it generates enough income to get by until the harvesting season, and for this reason she wants to increase her working capital.

They tell us that they named it thus because most of the members live in a place called Flores Mag\u00f3n.  The group is located in the town of Zit\u00e1cuaro in the state of Michoac\u00e1n.  It has 11 members.\r\n\r\nThe group representative is Mar\u00eda Socorro S. D\u00edaz.  Do\u00f1a Soco, as her family and acquaintances call her, is 43 years old.  She studied to be an Executive Secretary but says that she never practiced her profession because she married very young and her husband didn\u2019t let her work so that she could dedicate herself totally to home and children.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Soco is a very hard working woman.  Her husband realized in time that what he earned wasn\u2019t sufficient to support the family so she decided to help him with household expenses and started her plastics business.  Now, both of them sell plastic bags, drinking glasses, Styrofoam dishes, spoons, forks, etc.  She tells us that her customers are people who have stands in the market, tortilla makers and bakers.  She has been in this business for 7 years and has her plastics stand outside the Zit\u00e1cuaro, Michoac\u00e1n market where she also sells women\u2019s underwear and crafts like bathroom sets, napkins, decorated purses, etc.\r\n\r\nSocorro has been married to Mario for 22 years and they have three daughters:  Marisol, 22, Stephanie, 19, both married, and Carol, 17 who is studying to be a teacher at the Zit\u00e1cuaro Normal School.  Socorro hopes that her youngest daughter finishes her career because she says that\u2019s the best inheritance a parent can leave her children.\r\n\r\nRoci\u00f3 Sanrom\u00e1n M., 29, is also part of the \u201cFlores Mag\u00f3n\u201d group.  She is currently finishing high school in the Open High School program because her parents couldn\u2019t afford to buy her uniforms and school supplies back when she was in regular school.  She says her husband is a great help to her because he encourages her to continue forward and study a career.  Do\u00f1a Rosi, as her friends and family refer to her, sells candies, juices, chicharrones (made from soy), soft-drinks, snacks, popsicles, etc. in front of the Zit\u00e1cuaro Regional Hospital.  \r\n\r\nShe has had the business for two years.  She comments that she started selling juices and other items because she noticed that family members of patients in the hospital didn\u2019t have anything to eat at lunch so she decided to set up her stand.  Another motive behind her doing this is that she wanted to help her husband meet household expenses.\r\n\r\nRosi is married to Salvador, who is an attorney, and they have a six year old daughter named Leylan who is in first grade.\r\n\r\nRosi says that her life goal is to have a stable location where she can sell her candy and also sell costume jewelry because she likes to design jeweled necklaces and bracelets.  Another one of her goals is to finish high school and then complete a career in Law.\r\n\r\nShe says that profits from the candy and juice sales will be to buy the lot to build the locale she so dreams of.\r\n\r\nThe other nine group members are: Mar\u00eda Guadalupe Juli\u00e1n C., Reyna P.

It has 5 members who know each other and are neighbours. Miss Tita A. M. is a member of the La Parota group. She is 44 and studied up to high school, obtaining her certificate. She has 5 children: Bonifacio is 21 and works; Juan is 19, married and works; Antonio is 13 and in high school; Gloria is 10 and is in elementary school; and Ana is 8 and is in elementary school. Tita requested this loan for the purchase of thread and clasps to have material for her industrial workshop. She manufactures orders from T\u00e9tela del Volc\u00e1n and takes pre-cut uniforms which she stitches and finishes up. Once they are ready, customers come from T\u00e9tela del Volc\u00e1n to pick them up at her house. In 15 to 20 days she has finished uniforms for San Luis Potos\u00ed and M\u00e9xico. \r\nShe started her business 4 years ago, sewing on a pedal machine, and later she bought her industrial machines, paying 50% in cash. She has been paying the other half with loans that she has received. She makes school uniforms, police uniforms, bulletproof vests, and riot police uniforms. She makes clothing for school dances for her customers in Jantetelco. She uses her earnings for this business to feed her children, repay her loans, and invest in thread and clasps. \r\nThe group members are Tita Gloria A. M., who will buy thread, clasps, fabric etc with her loan for her clothing, to provide better service;  Amelia E. Jayesi, who will buy board games to put with her video games; Maria Geomara E. Arag\u00f3n who will buy rabbits and alfalfa to raise and sell them; Jhanet Guti\u00e9rrez V., who will buy vegetables, bread, meat for hamburgers and teleras for her Mexican delicacy business; and Martina H. P., who will purchase underwear to sell through catalogues. \r\nThe group m embers want to tell Kiva and Fundacion Realidad \"to increase the amount you lend to us and lower our interest in order to help us expand our businesses\". Tita's sister and brother-in-law help her to sew, and she would like to buy 4 other different machines to make better products. The business is important because this is how they eat and maintain their children. Her favourite part of working in this business is sewing the uniforms and getting paid. She wants to open a larger store for the machines. Her dreams are to see her children grown with careers. The village of Jantetelco is a peaceful village. There are no problems. They make crystallized candy and baked fruit which are small baked goods.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Christine Cooper, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1975,"image":{"id":599804,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cloth & Dressmaking Supplies","sector":"Retail","use":"the purchase of thread, clasps, and fabrics for her clothes-making","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"JANTETELCO MORELOS","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2010-09-27T16:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1975,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tita Gloria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amelia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Geomara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jhanet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":25000,"loan_amount":1975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3125},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3125},{"due_date":"2010-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":3125},{"due_date":"2010-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":3125},{"due_date":"2010-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":3125},{"due_date":"2010-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":3125},{"due_date":"2010-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":3125},{"due_date":"2010-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":3125}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":246.88},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":246.87},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":246.88},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":246.87},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":246.88},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":246.87},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":246.88},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":246.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":246.88,"local_amount":3125,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-20T08:27:02Z","rounded_local_amount":3155,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172121210,"comment":null},{"amount":246.87,"local_amount":3125,"processed_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:25:37Z","rounded_local_amount":3155,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177415373,"comment":null},{"amount":246.88,"local_amount":3125,"processed_date":"2010-10-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:26:03Z","rounded_local_amount":3155,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177415374,"comment":null},{"amount":246.87,"local_amount":3125,"processed_date":"2010-10-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:26:30Z","rounded_local_amount":3155,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177415375,"comment":null},{"amount":493.75,"local_amount":6250,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:16:10Z","rounded_local_amount":6310.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182554967,"comment":null},{"amount":493.75,"local_amount":6250,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:17:38Z","rounded_local_amount":6310,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188691457,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-09-28T00:32:33Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T13:17:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":232735,"name":"White Mountain Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"   El se\u00f1or Romeo Gonz\u00e1lez G\u00f3mez ,tiene treinta y dos a\u00f1os de edad, es casado con la se\u00f1ora, Martha Yessenia Aguilar D\u00edaz, en donde apenas tiene una hija de dos a\u00f1os, Heidi yamileth en el cual se siente muy orgulloso de su familia.\n\n   Solicito el pr\u00e9stamo para poner una tienda de abarrotes y poder   obtener ingresos en su hogar, trabajando el pr\u00e9stamo, para que con eso mismo pueda pagar puntualmente y siga perteneciendo en el programa.\n\n   Lo que lo inspiro a esta actividad fue su familia poniendo una actividad donde su esposa este pendiente de la tienda y su hogar, mientras \u00e9l trabaja  en el campo sembrando ma\u00edz para venderlo y as\u00ed  juntos aporten en los gastos peque\u00f1os de su casa.\n\n   Con lo que obtiene de su venta de toda la semana, compra m\u00e1s mercanc\u00eda para que su tienda este cada d\u00eda m\u00e1s surtida y con cosas de  mejor calidad.

G. is thirty two years old, he is married with Martha Yessenia Aguilar Diaz and they have a two year old daughter, Heidi Yamileth. He is very proud of his family. He requests a loan to set up a grocery store and to have a source of income for his family. Working in this business will allow him to make his payments on time and keep up as a participant in the program.\r\n\r\nHis inspiration is his family. He wanted to have a business that his wife will be able to manage in their house while he goes to the fields to care for their corn plantations. Together they will be able to cover the household expenses. With his weekly earnings he purchases more merchandise for the store so that every day the variety is replenished and the quality of the products improved. His goal is to have clients come to purchase merchandise regularly and therefore obtain better earnings and be able to provide his family with what they need. \r\n\r\nHis dream is to save enough funds so that their grocery store will improve day by day, and to provide only the best to his wife and daughter. They are the reason for his hard work.  Romeo became part of the group following an invitation from his godfather, Guillermo. He is a representative of the program and he became interested. It is thanks to their support that he has attained his goals. The group's name is White Mountain, a name that reflects where the group meets. It is next to a mountain of white rocks. \r\n\r\nThe group is made up of four men, each carries out a different business: \r\n\r\nGuillermo E. F.: will invest the loan in the purcase of cheeses in the region. \r\n\r\nFidadelfo M. M.: will invest the loan in the purchase materials to make building blocks (cement and sand). \r\n\r\nPorfirio E.

Her family is made up of her husband and three school-aged children. Rosa previously worked as a cleaner, but with time her family's costs kept increasing and their salaries were not enough at times. She decided to fix this and start a business that would give her a greater income. She now sells cosmetics, luxury items and clothing in general. She offers her products in homes and in the school that her children attend, since she knows many people there and never passes up the chance to sell. Sales are very good and December is the month in which they increase a little more. She always tries to have variety and good prices to keep her customers. She stocks up every eight days and benefits from the fact that the merchandise is brought to her home, so she does not have to spend money on transportation. With the requested loan she will purchase merchandise such as: blouses, pants, t-shirts, jackets, etc., in order to increase her earnings. Rosa's plans are to be able to offer a better future to her children, and that they will lack nothing for their proper development.

It is composed of five members who already knew each other well since they are neighbors.\r\n\r\nSra. Herminia M. R. is one of the members of the group.  She is 57 years old and has a 5th grade education.  She sells seasonal fruit and is asking for a loan to buy fruit such as avocados, peaches, sapodilla, and cherimoya.  Herminia sells her merchandise in the Xochimilco market, which is a large market where many people come to stock up on goods.  Her business faces competition from 20 other stalls that are trained to sell the same products so some luck is involved.\r\n\r\nSra. Herminia started her business of selling fruit 25 years ago.  Her mother-in-law taught her to sell by starting with newspapers, and she learned gradually.  Her mother-in-law saw that she was doing well and was now selling more fruit that she had to buy them wholesale.  She buys the fruit and avocados in Yecapixtla.  To get to her business, it takes an hour and a half.  In Tlalnepantla, she takes the bus that drops her off in the Xochimilco market.  She wants to save to buy a cart to avoid paying bus fare and to avoid lifting heavy boxes.\r\n\r\nHerminia is pleased with the loan that she will invest in buying fruit for her business, which is popular after 30 years of selling in the Xochimilco market.  Her husband helps her sell on Saturdays and Sundays which is when there are more customers.  She serves approximately 40 people an hour and then it slows down.  When it is very rainy, sometimes she doesn\u2019t sell at all.  She wants to improve her home by putting in plaster, pouring in concrete, and putting in doors and windows.   The village of Tlalnepantla is very nice and peaceful.  There isn\u2019t any smog and you can see the hills, plantations of prickly pear, sapodilla, and plums.\r\n\r\nThe members of the group are as follows:\r\n\u2022 Sra. Guadalupe \u00c1vila M. will use the loan to buy organic fertilizer by the truckload to fertilize her sown fields of nopal (edible cactus).\r\n\u2022 Sra. Leticia L. C. will pay a rental service for a motocultor (rototiller with trailer), weeding, and cactus removal.\r\n\u2022 Sra. Marquelia R. D\u00edas will buy perfume for kit packages containing perfumes, lipsticks, and blush.\r\n\u2022 Sra. Herminia M. R. will buy seasonal fruit, avocado, peaches, and cherimoya wholesale.\r\n\u2022 Sra.

She is 38 years old and she went to school up until middle school. She has her certificate. She has 2 children, Nadia Vianey, 19, who works in the business helping her make slippers, and Ricardo, 17, who studies at CBTIS. Lidia asked for her loan to enlarge her business. She is going to buy materials for stuffed animals such as foam and plastic, as well as insoles to make slippers. Her business in next to the highway and has little space. It is in her house in Moyotepec. She wants to enlarge her workshop and have more space to work and open another curtain. Her customers are people who pass by on the highway in their cars who see the slippers and like them enough to take 3 or 4 pairs. People who live here in Moyotepec pass by and like them as well. Sometimes they order the color of their preference. She offers her customers slippers, stuffed animals, cushions and perfumes. She started her business 5 years ago. She was working in a factory that makes slippers and she learned how. Now she makes them. She buys the fabric. She has two sewing machines, one she bought and one her husband bought. She considers her business to be important because with it she pays the family expenses. She bought her sewing machine to help her children's studies and she feels proud that she has been able to get her children ahead. She doesn't have to borrow for her children's school fees, she uses the money from her business. Her daughter helps her make the slippers. She cuts the pieces and she finishes them. She puts on the eyes, the nose, etc. When she has a lot of work, her husband helps as well. He sews the pieces when it's cold out, which is when they sell more and ramp up production.  Lidia is very happy with the loan which will give her help to enliven her business. She is going to invest more in it and increase production. She hopes to make the improvements for her children, so that they can have their own space. She wants to make more bedrooms, and she also wants to grow her business and give work to someone who can help with the work.

She was married and has two children out of that marriage: Elariceli, age 17, and Francisco Javier, age 22. Both are married. Maria has made tamales and toast with cream in bulk for four years. She makes good income from her home. She says that she decided to do this type of business to help out with her household costs and tend to her family. Before, she worked in houses as a maid to support her children. With the earnings from her business she buys ingredients for the tamales, such as corn, oil, meat, and raisins; and for the toast she buys cream. Thus, she re-invests in order to keep working without any problems. This way she is also able to save to repay this loan from Fundacion Realidad A.C. \r\n\r\nAntonia's dream is to build a solid kitchen so that she can better do her job, since currently she just has planks and the wind does not allow her to progress. She would also like for this job to change her living conditions so that she can get ahead.\r\n\r\nThey made this group because of a promotion in their village. Rosaura is the group representative. They were interested in her and asked her to join them. The group is called Campo Verde [\"Green Field\"] because in the area the group is located there are hills and spaces of green grass.

He lives in his own home with his wife Bertha, age 34, and their 4 beloved children, to whom he wants to offer a better quality of life. His great persistence in his work has been a great help in bringing money into his home. This characteristic has been his main strength, since he works cutting lumber and selling it as firewood. This activity has given him sufficient funds to help with the household costs and to be able to pay for his children's education. His favourite part of his job is planting trees, since every time he cuts one he has to plant another. This way, he maintains his base of material. He has been doing this work for 2 years and finds his greatest difficulty to be having to cut down the trees, because he always runs the danger that the tree will fall on someone; so he is always very careful doing it. In the near future, he hopes to buy himself a piece of forest, from which he could take material without having to buy it first. This is his second loan with MFP. He is very happy to have obtained it and is prepared to repay all of his quotas punctually. He is very well-liked in his community bank. With the 500 soles that he is requesting, he will purchase new trees to obtain firewood. This way, he will be able to fill the pending orders that he has.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Christine Cooper, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":603782,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase trees.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:21Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vidal ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":200,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:32:58Z","rounded_local_amount":559.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206195580,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-10-01T19:09:42Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T11:32:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":232757,"name":"Sonia Magaly","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Sonia de 30 a\u00f1os,  es vendedora de productos Yambal (empresa de cosm\u00e9ticos que vende productos a un bajo costo para mujeres emprendedoras),vive en una zona periurbana llamada Perimetral.\n\nElla es madre soltera y para poder mantener a su hijo tubo que buscar un medio de dinero as\u00ed que una de sus amigas la inscribi\u00f3 como vendedora Yambal a domicilio por catalogo.

They both have 5 children, but only live with 2 of them: Jose, age 20, and Jean Carlos, age 12. They live together in their own home in the Palcamayo village. They own three plots of land for growing crops. Every day, Armanda goes to sow peas and spinach: crops which she cares for, waters and fertilizers for approximately three months. This is sufficient time to harvest them and sell them in the central market of their area. She says that there are seasons when demand is greater, so she travels to the capital to offer them at a better price. From her childhood, she was taught to work the land and make it produce. She knows when it is harvest time, and when to sell and at what price; during all this time Armanda has always been upset to see her crops fail in the constant frost that batters the south of the country. She now wants to continue harvesting, so she will buy more land in order to expand her planting. This is her tenth loan with MFP and she is grateful for the help that her community bank offers her.

Together they make an effort to get ahead in life daily.  For the last 14 years this hard working man has provided public transportation services in a combi (a 12-passenger vehicle).  He says that he enjoys his work very much because he earns regular income.  Besides, he amuses himself quite a bit as he travels along the streets observing. Although the city traffic often exhausts him he knows that every sacrifice has its reward.  In this case it\u2019s daily profits he gets after a long day of work.\r\n\r\nThus the days pass for this man who has many plans in mind, like buying several vehicles to launch a transportation firm.  He therefore makes a daily effort to reach this goal.\r\n\r\nThis is his first loan with MFP and he promises to repay on time because he doesn\u2019t want to disappoint all those who made the money possible that will permit him to succeed with his business.\r\n\r\nLuis plans to use the requested funds to buy new tires because the ones he has are pretty deteriorated.

They live together in a densely populated neighbourhood in the north of the city, and have a great desire to get ahead. Every day is a constant fight to get ahead in life for this hard-working man. For 2 years, he has offered a taxi service. He says that he likes this work very much, and the time he has spent in this work has allowed him to acquire loyal customers who call him when they need to go somewhere. This has allowed him to have a steady income. He works in the streets of the city in the daytime, but he does not like the night schedule much, since it is dangerous. Since the car is his own, he has no problems setting his schedule and his route. Along with this job, he also has a store in a large commercial centre where he sells cds. He is helped by an employee who tends to the business, and it generates him regular income. This is how his days go by, always looking out for his family's well-being. He is always thinking of the future. He plans to expand his cd store and acquite his own location, since his current location is rented. This is his first loan with MFP, and he promises to repay his quotas punctually, since he does not want to lose face with the people who have provided the loan that will allow him to continue working in the search of progress. Teofilo plans to invest the requested loan in the purchase of cds to better stock his business.

She is a very hard-working person.   Six years ago she started her first business running a small restaurant, but for the past two years she has been selling groceries.  She has a small store that she runs out of her house.  Business hours are from 6:00 am until 9:00 pm.  The main advantage of this business is that there are no other grocery stores in her neighborhood so all her neighbors shop at her store. \r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan to buy more groceries in order to increase and diversify her stock.  Her goal is to have a small market that will bring in a better income so that she can continue supporting her children's studies.

V., a married woman who lives in Brgy. Talisay, Santander, Cebu, earns her living through her food vending and pig fattening businesses. Her husband, Domingo V., 44, works as a farmer to earn his living.  They have seven children ranging in age from 8 to 37, two of whom have their own families, while two others are employed and another is a student.<p>\r\n\r\nTemotia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired to something better for her family. With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Temotia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 10000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living. For her fifth loan, she is borrowing PHP 10000 to purchase business raw materials so that she can continue to save up for the future and send her children to school. Temotia V. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.  <p>\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.<p>\r\n\r\nHelp NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by clicking  the link to the   NWTF Kiva lending team  on Kiva.org to join our

Mrs. Chen C. is 40 years old. She's become the village bank president selected by the other members, each of whom will use their portion of the loan for different purposes. \r\n\r\nShe and her husband, Mr. Sao Phoung, are farmers who own a 1.3-hectare plot of land in which to cultivate rice to sell to support their family.

M\u00e1xima has a fruit stand that is located in very busy spot along the side of the road that leads to the city of Tegucigalpa.  She sells all types of fruits, primarily those that are in season.  She started her business 14 years ago selling candy, churros, cookies, etc., but realized that these types of products were not attractive to the people that passed by her stand.   This is what prompted her to start selling fruit.  \r\n\r\nWith this loan she will buy a larger quantity of fruit such as watermelons, oranges and bananas.  This will allow her to earn more and to continue supporting her family and cover her youngest child's educational expenses.  One of the difficulties that she faces is that one of her nephews can't walk or talk and most of the time he is hospitalized.  This is very expensive.  Her dreams are that her nephew's health improves, to own a large and beautiful store and to own her own house as she is renting and her monthly payment is very expensive.  She has been a FAMA client for six years.  The loans have enabled her to better herself and to improve her economic situation.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ann Achilli, Kiva

B. is a married woman who lives in Prk.

Her husband Francisco B., who is 45 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities. Their only child is 19 years old. \r\n\r\nCarmelita  joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1992 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 29 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Carmelita  has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 29,500, which was funded by Kiva lenders, helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 30th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 35,000, which she intends to use to purchase more stock to sell in her general store and also to buy a side-car for her motorcycle transport so that she can continue to save up for the future to sustain their daily needs and to educate her daughter. Carmelita B. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

P. is from the village of Eastern, Wao, Lanao del Sur.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from serving a variety of different meals to customers in the local community. Elena has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 9000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Elena joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Elena has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase food & drinks for the restaurant. Elena is requesting a new loan of 8000 PHP which will be used to invest in renovating the business. This will be the 2nd loan taken out by Elena from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is an accredited partner of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and reaches out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

The idea of having this kind of business crossed her mind when her husband Herminio who is a fisherman caught more fish than their family could consume. Enonita sold those in their neighborhood and she realized that selling fish brings in profits bigger and faster than any other kind of business she had had in the past years of her life. Selling fish could be on a daily basis if she could buy fish from other fishermen in their village at times when her husband has a small catch. \r\n\r\nUnlike other products sold, fish is salable because it is one of the most basic needs of Filipinos, especially for people who live in very remote areas of the province. They are far from the municipal market thus, the possibility of buying from vendors who come to their community is very high. Also, most people choose to buy fish rather than any other meat because it is cheaper and healthier.\r\n\r\nFrom then on, Enonita used her loan from ASHI in her buying and selling fish business. Out of the profit she had, she was able to invest in her home and support her family financially. \r\n\r\nShe kept on borrowing from ASHI to keep her business growing. Now, she plans to use her newly received loan in increasing the volume of fish she buys and sells so that someday, out of her business profit, she will be able to invest more in her home. Being a 64-year-old woman, Enonita wants her son to have his own livelihood. She believes that her business is the only inheritance she can turn over to him.

N. is a widow  who lives in Purok 1, Brgy. Cabacungan, La Castellana, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating three business ventures:   Dressmaking \/ Sewing , Ready-to-Wear (RTW) Sales and Food Vending businesses. Eva joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 6 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Eva has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 13,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4700,  uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 7th loan, she is borrowing PHP 16,000, which she intends to use to pay for more RTW inventory and materials for her dressmaking businesses so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children.  \r\n\r\nEva N. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\n In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

M. is a 48-year-old married woman who supports her family by operating a fishing business. She lives in Prk. Ipil-ipil, Brgy Vito, Sagay City, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 1995 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. \r\n\r\nBy working hard in her fishing business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income income of 8,000 Philippine pesos (PHP). \r\n\r\nLeonarda is now borrowing PHP 19,500 so that she can repair and maintain her fishing boat and purchase more  fishing gear and materials. This will be her 14th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 19,500, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Leonarda aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the  Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\") way.\r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon. Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\r\nHelp NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by clicking the link to the NWTF Kiva lending team on Kiva.org to join our team:

Maricel is requesting a new loan of 8000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. This will be the 2nd loan taken out by Maricel from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

E. is a married woman who lives in Purok 1, Barangay Cabacungan, La Castellana, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures: rice farming and a livestock business. Her husband Romeo, who is 60 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have 6 children who are 26 to 38 years old. \r\n\r\nCharlie joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1993 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 15 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Charlie has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 29500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 13500, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 16th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 29500, which she intends to use to maintain her rice field so that she can continue to save up for future expansion of the business. Charlie E. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work. \r\n\r\nHelp NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by clicking the link to the NWTF Kiva lending team on Kiva.org to join our

She has been selling vegetables such as kales, potatoes, tomatoes, spinach, onions and cabbages for the last ten years to the local people, including shop owners, passers-by and students. She says that this business is profitable and the major challenge she has is that there are so many other people in the area doing the same business as hers. Customers are not loyal, as they are spoiled for choice. However, she works very hard from early morning to late evening to keep her business doing well. She is using her loan of KES 20,000 to buy more vegetables to expand her business. She hopes to be a wholesaler in the future. She also hopes to purchase a plot and build a residential house.

She is a qualified teacher who notwithstanding the low remuneration has set a precedent in most schools she teaches in with her exemplary vigor and enthusiasm whilst she goes about her trivial round. This has in many respects gotten her into the good books of many school head teachers, who all speak glowingly of her high-spirited attitude and line of conduct.   \r\n\r\nBy her own account, teaching is a profession she is proud of and that is principally the reason she strives to give a good account of herself in whatever school she teaches in. \r\n\r\nFlorence is single and has no kids but she has responsibilities that look her in the face every day.

She earns her living by operating two business ventures: a general store and a mobile phone service electronic re-loading businesses. \r\n\r\nHer husband Jose L., who is 40 years old, works as a security guard to earn his living. They have an 8-year old child. \r\n\r\nCarmela joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Carmela has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 8000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 7500, uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 5th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 12000, which she intends to use to  purchase more stocks to sell, so that she can continue to save up for future education of her child. Carmela L. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from manufacturing knives (blacksmith) and selling them in the community. Margie has been engaged in her business for over 12 years and earns approximately 4200 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Margie joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Margie has successfully repaid a previous loan of 15000 PHP from ASKI. Margie is requesting a new loan of 18000 PHP which will be used to purchase raw materials to manufacture additional products. This loan will be the 7th loan taken out by Margie from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

B. is from the village of Brgy.

The main source of income for the business comes from selling daily-use products such as shampoo, soap and toothpaste in the local community. Eleonor has been engaged in her business for over six years and earns approximately 3,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) a month from it.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Eleonor joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Eleonor is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the first loan taken out by Eleonor from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children. \r\n\r\n<b>About ASKI:<\/b>\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.
