She is single and has 2 children, aged 21 and 20, one of whom is in college. Mary has 2 additional dependents who live with her in order to attend school. In 1992, Mary established her essential drugs (pharmacy) business. \r\n\r\nWhen Mary left high school, she did not have someone to sponsor her because her parents were poor. She went into sales and when she had enough capital, she opened a small stall. In order to fulfill her dream of becoming a nurse, she enrolled in training as a pharmacist and she now owns a pharmacy, selling drugs to patients. Working 7 days a week and 16 hours a day, Mary earns about SLL 2,256,000 monthly from her business. \r\n\r\n<p>Mary has already received and successfully repaid 1 loan. She would now like a new loan of SLL 4,000,000 in order to buy Pinoplex blood syrup (4 cartons @ SLL 140,000 each), pain relief (5 cartons @ SLL 50,000 each), Lucmal (anti malarial) drug (10 cartons @ SLL 120,000 each), Zincofer blood syrup (5 cartons @ SLL 140,000 each), Lucozade (10 cartons @ SLL 100,000 each) and Amodiquin hydrochlode tabs (1 carton @ SLL 250,000), with the balance used as transport fare. Mary hopes that this loan will enable her to increase her monthly profits by approximately SLL 564,000.\r\n\r\n<p>Mary doesn't face much competition since she is the only one owning a pharmacy in the area. She serves about 60 people per day, and her business is popular because she treats her customers with care and respect. Mary is assisted by her closest family members. She usually orders twice a month through delivery van from Freetown. In the future, Mary plans to save enough money for her retirement. She feels good and nervous about the future prospects of her business because she needs someone with good experience and capabilities to run her business when she retires. She wants her child and her dependents to finish school. The loan will help as she will be able to save money. Mary is hardworking and honest.

is a 40-year-old married woman with five children, all of whom attend school.  She owns a house with piped water but no electricity. Her greatest monthly expenses are food for her family and school fees for her children. Her husband, who is employed, also contributes to the provision of family basic needs.\r\n\r\nLuvuno has operated a retail shop for the past 4 years. In addition to the shop, she runs a water selling business and owns a (boda boda) motorcycle  transport business. Her potential clients are her neighbors.

She is married to Raniel, a laborer, and is the mother to their children. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nYolanda runs an \u201cukay-ukay\u201d business. \u201cUkay\u201d literally means to \u201cdig out\u201d or \u201chollow out\u201d from a stack or heap of anything. In Yolanda\u2019s case, she is selling used (but not yet worn out) clothes that are usually stacked up on a table or mat. Some special kinds are displayed on hangers. In the Philippines, especially in urban poor communities, many people resort to buying used clothes from \u201cukay-ukay\u201d stalls. These are much cheaper compared with brand new clothes sold in malls. Since Yolanda\u2019s stall is located in an urban poor public market, her business flourishes. She earns a minimum of 300 Philippine Pesos (PHP) net sales every day. \r\n\r\nTo help her expand the business, Yolanda is requesting a PHP10,000 loan to buy additional used-but-quality clothes. Customers are attracted to buy from an \u201cukay-ukay\u201d stall with lots of clothes to choose from. She plans to add more pants or jeans, and also used bags and footwear. If she can roll the profits from this loan, she can meet the customers\u2019 demand. Through proper management of capital and profit, she can expand her business and boost its income.\r\n\r\nYolanda hopes to to give her children a good future and a high quality education through all her hard work on her business.

But there\u2019s nothing to compare to the paintings which are in most demand.  She earns from 120 to 150 soles per 1 meter x 1 meter painting and even more during Holy Week.  She enjoys what she does.\r\n\r\nEsther wants to set up a stand in her district\u2019s civic center but to do so she has to invest in the purchase of shelving, containers, and display cases as well as to rent the locale.

los d\u00edas la vida de Nicol\u00e1s transcurren en la pr\u00e1ctica de una caminata diaria de 2 horas y esto no lo hace por Hobbie, aunque si con una gran alegr\u00eda: Nicol\u00e1s se desempe\u00f1a en su negocio de vender los deliciosos y jugosos aguacates que le traen del Carmen, en el departamento de Bol\u00edvar y limones cultivados a lo largo del Rio Magdalena,  loa cuales traslada en una carretilla  rebosada  del  verde  color de estas  frutas, que entrega  directamente en las manos de sus clientes,  ubicados en una urbanizaci\u00f3n muy lejana cerca a las Playas de la ciudad. Nicol\u00e1s se despierta bien temprano, llena su carretilla de aguacates y limones y se va a visitar a sus clientes; a ellos  los tiene acostumbrados a recibir las frutas  en la puerta de su casa, que entrega  mediante una conversaci\u00f3n amena y muy Caribe.  Con esta actividad  ha logrado sacar adelante a su familia, conformada por su c\u00f3nyuge y sus 4 hijos en las edades de 18 a 32 a\u00f1os. \nNicol\u00e1s fue educado por su abuela y desde los 13 a\u00f1os est\u00e1 trabajando, primero lo hizo vendiendo cocadas, o dulces elaborados a base de coco y\/o guayaba, luego trabaj\u00f3 ayudando a los vendedores de frutas y posteriormente, cuando conform\u00f3 su familia y con la suficiente experiencia, emprendi\u00f3 su sue\u00f1o de ser independiente. Es por esto que desde hace 5 a\u00f1os, trabaja persistentemente en su propio negocio, teniendo como norte lograr bienestar para su familia, dispuesto a  que en un futuro \u201cno pasen trabajo\u201d, como el mismo lo dice. Como la meta  de Nicol\u00e1s es tener un dep\u00f3sito o local donde conservar las frutas,  gradualmente necesita crecer, aumentando su clientela y su capacidad de comercializaci\u00f3n. Esta es la raz\u00f3n por la cual acude a su credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, con el cual comprar\u00e1 en mayor volumen y de contado aguacates y limones, para disminuir los precios del producto, pues compra diario con dinero de cr\u00e9dito informal y altamente costoso y con ello para poder sostenerse,  incrementa el precio del producto, raz\u00f3n por la cual est\u00e1 en condiciones desiguales en el mercado; esto es posible solucionarlo con credikiva ,  financiaci\u00f3n que planea seria exitosa porque aprovechar\u00eda  los costos de  oportunidad,  debido a que  tendr\u00eda un capital para negociar  por vol\u00famenes y de contado y lograr\u00eda acceder a precios de productos sostenibles, que as\u00ed mismo trasladar\u00e1 a sus clientes, haciendo que su negocio  sea mas competitivo.\n","en":"Every day, Nicol\u00e1s\u2019s life includes a daily 2-hour walk and he doesn\u2019t do this as a hobby although he does do it joyfully.  Nicol\u00e1s sells delicious, juicy avocadoes that they bring him from El Carmen in Bol\u00edvar Department and lemons farmed along the Magdalena River which he transports in a wheelbarrow lush with the green color of these fruits that he delivers directly into the hands of his customers located in a settlement quite far from the city\u2019s beaches.    Nicol\u00e1s wakes up very early, fills up his wheelbarrow with avocadoes and lemons and heads out to visit his customers.  He has accustomed them to receive their fruit at their doorsteps, a delivery he carries out with a very enjoyable, Caribbean conversation.  With this activity he\u2019s managed to support his family which consists of his spouse and four children ranging in age from 18 to 32.\r\n\r\nNicol\u00e1s was educated by his grandmother and has been working since he was 13 years old.  First he worked selling \u2018cocadas,\u2019 candy made from coconut and\/or guava.  Then he worked helping fruit merchants and still later when he formed his own family and with the gained experience, he started his dream of being independent.  Because of this, for the last five years he has worked persistently in his own business his guiding star being is family\u2019s wellbeing.  As he himself says, he\u2019s determined that they should \u201cnot have to go through struggles\u201d in the future.\r\n\r\nSince Nicolas\u2019s goal is to have a warehouse or depository to keep his fruit, he gradually needs to grow increasing his clientele and his capacity for sales.  This is why he\u2019s calling on a Kiva loan, his first financing with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, that he will use to pay cash for larger amounts of avocadoes and lemons so he can reduce the price he pays since he currently buys daily with money from informal loans which is extremely expensive but this is the way he\u2019s be able to stay in business but the price of his products increases leaving him at a disadvantage in the marketplace.  All of this can be solved with a Kiva loan, financing he hopes will be successful because he will be able to take advantage of special promotional prices because he\u2019ll have capital with which to negotiate cash payments for volume purchases thus obtaining sustainable product prices that he can pass on to his customers making his business more competitive.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":35.37,"image":{"id":988407,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"to pay cash for large amounts of avocadoes and lemons.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-01-24T19:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nicol\u00e1s","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":400000,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":62883},{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":64350},{"due_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":65851},{"due_date":"2012-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":67388},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":68960},{"due_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":70568}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.37},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.2},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.04},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.91},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.79},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.69}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":35.37,"local_amount":62883,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:35:11Z","rounded_local_amount":64517.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263325119,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-24T20:44:57Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":383584,"name":"Nexar Octavio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Nexar Octavio tiene 26 a\u00f1os de estado civil Union Libre vive con la compa\u00f1era y con un hijo de 6 a\u00f1os.

Because the prices for these goods have been going up, savings from his business are not enough. In addition, Fedor believes that taking out a business loan is convenient and advantageous. Last year Fedor also took out a loan to buy greenhouse film, seeds and fertilizers.

Since then she has paid back all her loans and expanded her business. \r\n\r\nAfter her last loan, which she invested in her business, Isabel realised the need to improve her home by building a decent kitchen as the one she has is very weak and not safe. This is the reason why she talked to other members of her group and they recommended her for a Housing loan to improve her home kitchen. \r\n\r\nEsperanza Internacional runs a programme for their good clients who are reliable in paying back their loans, who have fulfilled the commitment to grow their business and who have shown fidelity in their groups. This allows them to take out a loan to improve the structure of their house at the same time as running their business and attending their group meetings.\r\n\r\nIsabel is the mother of five children. Two of them live with her and her husband in their simple rural home. Isabel will use this loan to buy wood, zinc, nails, cement and other construction materials.

He lives in the municipality of Chimor\u00e9, province of Carrasco, in the city of Cochabamba. He lives together with Mar\u00eda Magdalena and their children. He works as a mason, and he also helps his wife Mar\u00eda in her sales stand at a kindergarten. Unfortunately, like many men, Hugo fell into the vice of drinking, and he was neglecting his affairs and even putting his family aside. But time and the responsibility for maintaining his family led Hugo to come to his senses and concern himself more with the well-being of his loved ones. Thus he began working alone, without friends, and he built up a good reputation with his wife's acquaintances, who needed him often for their projects. Over time he advanced to managing construction teams, which was his best distraction, and thus he forgot little by little the problem that lede him to neglect his own situation and that of his family. Now he has a good reputation in his work, and he obtains contracts that give him a better income and let him provide better living conditions for his family. Now he is requesting a loan which he will use to pay for a bladder operation for his wife, since she is a bit overweight and she has been having trouble with her bladder for some time, but the lack of money prevented her from getting medical checkups. She contributes greatly to the family, since with the sales stand at the kindergarten she covers a lot of expenses, and this is also where she finds the contacts for Hugo's work contracts. Mar\u00eda realizes that this was negligence on her part, but now she and her husband are requesting a loan to improve her health; she will undergo an operation that is not very complicated, and then she will be able to continue operating her sales stand and maintaining her family without hindrances to her daily activities. For Hugo, health comes first, and without having health insurance, he decided to pay for his wife's operation and pay off the loan in installments as quickly as possible. \n\nHugo's desire is that his children will have a future that is better than the path he had to travel. He wants to help them finish an advanced high school degree, and his next goal will be to set them on their path with higher education. He will work very hard and do everything possible to make this a reality, so he can see his children in the future with lives that are full and improved.\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1004116,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Medical

Over all the years of his work, Sergei has invested about 100,000 hryven (UAH) in his farm.  However, his net profit has been a little more than 5,000 hryven.\r\n\r\nThe loan he gets through Kiva will make it possible for Sergei to buy seed in the amount of 6,000 hryven, the necessary fertilizers in the amount of 4,000 hryven, to build an additional greenhouse for 6,000 hryven, and to buy polyethylene film for 4,000.

Adem\u00e1s, espera que su negocio le brinde la posibilidad de ofrecerle a sus 3 hijos el acceso a una educaci\u00f3n universitaria que les permita prepararse y obtener un empleo bien remunerado. \n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1009431,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Compra de insecticidas y fungicidas para su cultivo y evitar que una plaga se propague por sus cultivos.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Medell\u00edn","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Victor Adolfo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1200000,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":65363},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":67208},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":69105},{"due_date":"2012-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":71056},{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":73061},{"due_date":"2012-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":75123},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":77244},{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":79424},{"due_date":"2012-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":81666},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":83971},{"due_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":86342},{"due_date":"2013-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":88779},{"due_date":"2013-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":91285},{"due_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":93862},{"due_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":96511}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.77},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.8},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.87},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.97},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.1},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.26},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.45},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.94},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.23},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.57},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.94},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.35},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.79},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.29}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":394308,"name":"Martha Ines","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Martha ha trabajado en el negocio de las cafeter\u00edas durante 16 a\u00f1os, lo que le ha permitido tener muy buena experiencia para desarrollar su actividad.
