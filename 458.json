Many years ago, Betty started a business making cleaning products and soaps with the fresh scent of strawberry, apple, watermelon and peach.  In the beginning her business did well.  But then the supermarkets started to appear and sales fell because she couldn't compete.  After that, Betty began a new business preparing typical Peruvian dishes.  She's been running her new business for 3 years now, and her customers frequent her small restaurant for the delicious meals she prepares.   The busiest days are the weekends, when she sells every meal she prepares, making this a very good business.  Going forward, she would like to have another business that will generate more income, so she is considering opening a small general store in her home.   This is Betty's 13th loan with MFP and she has complied with all of her payments.  As a leader in her group she sets a good example.  With the new loan, she will purchase ingredients to prepare her meals, as well as a display case for her new general store.

She lives in her own home with her husband and two of her children, who are the reason behind her work.  For three years she has been informally selling trinkets at the entrance of the largest market in her district.  In order to formally establish this business, she obtained a permit from the municipality.  Since then she has sold all types of products such as hair clips, headbands, and other hair accessories.  The sale of these trinkets has provided her with good profits.  Now that a year has passed, Grethel currently works with her daughter and they take turns managing the business.  This gives her time to manage the rental income she generates from the car she owns.  Since she makes her car available for rent, she needs to buy spare parts in order to keep it maintained.

She is 51 years old and is a widow.\r\n\r\nBaktygul sells clothes and her elder sons help her with her business. She started selling clothes seven years ago when she rented a small shop with the help of a loan of 10,000 TJS from Kiva partner, Mol Bulak Finance. Now, she earns 12,000 TJS.\r\n\r\nWith the help of a loan, Baktygul was able to purchase a truck and furniture for her house. Also, she was able to increase her turnover. However, she wishes to increase her business further and this is why she applied for a loan.\r\n\r\nWith the loan Baktygul wants to purchase school uniforms and start a wholesale trade. In the future, she plans to reinvest all her profits in her business.\r\n\r\nAbout the other group members:\r\n\r\nGulmira T. is treasurer of the group. She is 37, married, and has two children: her son is 16 and her daughter is 13 and both of them go to school. Her husband is an electrician while Gulmira is a nurse at the local hospital. She is applying for a loan in order to purchase furniture for her house. In the future, she is planning to build a house and bathhouse.\r\n\r\nKanymbiubiu N. is fifty and a widow with four children: her sons are twenty-five, twenty two and sixteen and her daughter is twenty years old. Her youngest son works in clothing manufacture and her elder daughter is a waitress. Kanymbiubiu sells fish. Before that she was selling meat but three years ago she switched to selling fish. She started selling fish with an initial investment of 360 soms and now she earns 3,000 soms. She has a significant number of patrons and she is able to form very friendly relationships with them. Recently, one of her children was married and Kanymbiubiu therefore spent the most part of her money. Now, she needs some money to continue her business and so she is applying for a loan in order to increase her turnover. In the near future, she is planning to reinvest most part of her profits in her business and also raise her children.\r\n\r\nKulnara D. is forty-five and married. She has three children: her sons are nineteen and eighteen years old and her daughter is four years old. Her youngest daughter goes to kindergarten and her elder son is a mason in a boiler room while her second son works for a private entrepreneur who produces confectionery.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Today it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which erupted soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients have a workable business proposition.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

I. is married and the father of three children. He is a farmer. Educated up to the secondary school level, he had to quit school because he couldn't afford to attend. Abdugafar has a good work ethic. He has wholeheartedly committed himself to agriculture. Thanks to his hard work, he has today become a man known for his determination and serves as an example and reference for other farmers. He has been growing wheat, onions, melons and watermelons for the past twenty years. \r\n<p>\r\nAbdugafar is now seeking a loan of 10,500 TJS to buy seeds and fertilizer so as to be prepared for the upcoming season and so produce a good harvest. He can then better meet the needs of his family and improve his working conditions. \r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich place in history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the farthest reach of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged its already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous, and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve their agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History:\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients have access to reasonable financial services.

To make a living, Mohamad operates a family member's business venture making & selling food.

He and his parents have meat ball business in the local community.  Mohamad has been engaged in this business for over 5 years and earns approximately 750,000 IDR a month from these activities.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Mohamad joined MUK to gain access to financial services to help improve  his living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Mohamad is requesting for the first time a loan from MUK in the amount of 3,000,000 IDR which will be used to purchase additional inventory and as working capital.

He hopes to start up other branches in other places.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout MUK:\r\n\r\nThe mission of Koperasi Mitra Usaha Kecil (MUK) is to assist small businesses in BA. by providing training, business consultation and loans, thereby helping the owners and their families improve their everyday lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nMohamad A. M. (PK-10293) merupakan 24 tahun pria.  Dia (laki-laki) tinggal di kota Melaya - BA..  Dia (laki-laki) lajang dan tidak memiliki anak.  Untuk membiayai hidup, Mohamad menjalankan usaha milik anggota keluarga.  Bisnis beroperasi di sektor pangan.  Tujuan utama bisnis tersebut adalah membuat & menjual makanan.  Meskipun bukan satu-satunya sarana untuk menghasilkan pendapatan, sumber utama penghasilan bisnis tersebut terutama berasal dari menjual produk makanan khusus di tengah masyarakat setempat.  Mohamad sudah menjalankan bisnis ini selama lebih dari 5 tahun.  Dari kegiatan-kegiatan ini, Mohamad menghasilkan sekitar 750,000 IDR sebulan.\r\n\r\n\r\nDalam 2010, Mohamad bergabung MUK untuk mendapatkan akses ke layanan keuangan untuk membantu meningkatkan  -nya kondisi kehidupan dan kemampuan untuk menjalankan kegiatan bisnis.  Mohamad telah berhasil melunasi pinjaman sebelumnya dari MUK.    Dia (laki-laki) sekarang meminta pinjaman baru sebesar 3,000,000 IDR.  Pinjaman saat ini akan digunakan untuk untuk membeli inventaris & modal kerja tambahan.  Pinjaman ini akan menjadi 1st pinjaman yang diambil oleh peminjam dari MUK.  Mohamad berencana untuk menggunakan pendapatan tambahan yang dihasilkan dari bisnis  untuk tabungan sebagai cadangan bagi keadaan darurat di masa mendatang.\r\n\r\n\r\nTentang MUK:\r\n\r\nMisi Koperasi Mitra Usaha Kecil (MUK) adalah untuk membantu usaha kecil di BA. dengan memberikan perlatihan, konsultasi bisnis, dan pinjaman uang, dengan demikian membantu pemilik usaha dan keluarga mereka memperbaiki hidup sehari-hari.\r\n\r\nPesan untuk Peminjam Kiva: Grup ini memakai model pinjaman komunitas\/\"\"community lending\"\" (biasanya dijuluk Bank Desa\/\"\"Village Banking\"\") yang populer di Asia. Di model ini, sejumlah representatif dari grup akan meminjam uang sejumlah lebih besar untuk seluruh grup (kadang-kadang seluruh desa). Representatif ini akan distribusi dan mengendalikan pinjaman, dan mengkoleksi pembayaran untuk peminjam akhir.

(PK-10299) is a 48-year-old woman living in the town of Melaya - Bali.  She is married and has 2 adult children.  To making a living, Ni Nyoman owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from raising pigs for sale.  Ni Nyoman has been engaged in this business for over 7 years and earns approximately 500,000 IDR a month from these activities.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Ni Nyoman joined MUK to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Ni Nyoman is requesting for the first time a loan from MUK in the amount of 3,000,000 IDR which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise & sell in future.  Ni Nyoman plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand her business.\r\n\r\nShe also dreams of seeing all of her sons succeed and for MUK, she hopes than she can get a lower interest rate for next loan--maybe under 1 %.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout MUK:\r\n\r\nThe mission of Koperasi Mitra Usaha Kecil (MUK) is to assist small businesses in Bali by providing training, business consultation and loans, thereby helping the owners and their families improve their everyday lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nNi Nyoman K. (PK-10299) merupakan 48 tahun wanita.  Dia (perempuan) tinggal di kota Melaya - Bali.  Dia (perempuan) menikah dan memiliki 2 anak usia dewasa.  Untuk membiayai hidup, Ni Nyoman memiliki & menjalankan usaha.  Bisnis beroperasi di sektor pertanian.  Tujuan utama bisnis tersebut adalah memelihara ternak.  Meskipun bukan satu-satunya sarana untuk menghasilkan pendapatan, sumber utama penghasilan bisnis tersebut terutama berasal dari beternak babi untuk dijual.  Ni Nyoman sudah menjalankan bisnis ini selama lebih dari 7 tahun.  Dari kegiatan-kegiatan ini, Ni Nyoman menghasilkan sekitar 500,000 IDR sebulan.\r\n\r\n\r\nDalam 2010, Ni Nyoman bergabung MUK untuk mendapatkan akses ke layanan keuangan untuk membantu meningkatkan  -nya kondisi kehidupan dan kemampuan untuk menjalankan kegiatan bisnis.  Ni Nyoman telah berhasil melunasi pinjaman sebelumnya dari MUK.    Dia (perempuan) sekarang meminta pinjaman baru sebesar 3,000,000 IDR.  Pinjaman saat ini akan digunakan untuk untuk membeli bibit ternak untuk dibesarkan & dijual di masa mendatang.  Pinjaman ini akan menjadi 1st pinjaman yang diambil oleh peminjam dari MUK.  Ni Nyoman berencana untuk menggunakan pendapatan tambahan yang dihasilkan dari bisnis  untuk meningkatkan\/memperluas bisnis peminjam.\r\n\r\n\r\nTentang MUK:\r\n\r\nMisi Koperasi Mitra Usaha Kecil (MUK) adalah untuk membantu usaha kecil di Bali dengan memberikan perlatihan, konsultasi bisnis, dan pinjaman uang, dengan demikian membantu pemilik usaha dan keluarga mereka memperbaiki hidup sehari-hari.\r\n\r\nPesan untuk Peminjam Kiva: Grup ini memakai model pinjaman komunitas\/\"\"community lending\"\" (biasanya dijuluk Bank Desa\/\"\"Village Banking\"\") yang populer di Asia. Di model ini, sejumlah representatif dari grup akan meminjam uang sejumlah lebih besar untuk seluruh grup (kadang-kadang seluruh desa). Representatif ini akan distribusi dan mengendalikan pinjaman, dan mengkoleksi pembayaran untuk peminjam akhir. Ini adalah praktek umum dan efisien di daerah ini, tapi merumitkan cara lapor untuk Kiva. Tidak serupa pinjaman lain, partner Kiva, MUK, akan menjadi kontak utama dengan tim kepemimpinan grup, yang sebaliknya menjadi kontak dengan peminjam akhir. Demikian, jurnal yang ditulis akan merefleksikan hasilnya tim kepemimpinan, bukannya peminjam-peminjam akhir.\r\n\r\nUntuk belajari lebih banyak tentang Village Banking di Wikipedia, mohon kunjungi website ini: http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Village_Banking..  \t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":596999,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase baby livestock to raise & sell in future","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2010-09-09T20:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Nyoman","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":3000000,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2010-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2010-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2011-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2011-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2011-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2011-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2011-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2011-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2011-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2011-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2011-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2011-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2011-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2011-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2012-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2012-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2012-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2012-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2012-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2012-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2012-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2012-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":125000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.59},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.59},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.59},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.59},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.59},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.59},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.59},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.59},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":17.03,"local_amount":146000,"processed_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:03:45Z","rounded_local_amount":153555.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177441012,"comment":null},{"amount":332.97,"local_amount":2854000,"processed_date":"2010-11-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:48:52Z","rounded_local_amount":3001694.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182580949,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-09-09T23:30:00Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T14:48:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":229640,"name":"Zenaida","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Zenaida C. is from the village of Nabannagan, Lasam, Cagayan.

They own a house in a suburb of Darkhan. The eldest daughter is 7 and attends a local school and the two other children go to kindergarten. In 2003, Buyanbaatar bought a car on leasing contract from the bank and started his taxi business. He has been in this business for 7 years and bought a house for his family from his taxi business profit. \r\n\r\nBuyanbaatar\u2019s wife is a disabled woman with a lame leg, but she is a very energetic and enthusiastic businesswoman. She runs a small workshop in which she makes interwoven wool clothes and fabrics. She has six looms and employs four weaver workers. She produces wool products for a local textile factory on subcontract. Her order increases in the winter. \r\n\r\nBuyanbaatar and his wife raise a chicken and ducks in the garden as well.

By the grace of God, Rose has managed to support her children's schooling. At this time, she is working hard to be able to send them all the way through college -- a dream for most Filipino parents like Rose as she herself has been a college undergraduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents could leave to their children.\r\n\r\nRose operates a food stall while doing sideline work as a manicurist. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings when all of the family members are at home to take part of the meal. This is not only the usual family tradition but is also a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to use up cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands (prepared dishes) cost less than raw food. She also generates income from manicure and pedicure services. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 400 Philippine pesos (Php) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php16,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy raw ingredients for her food business and other materials needed for her manicure and pedicure services. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nRose dreams to be able to give her all her children a good and high-quality education through all her hard work in her business. She faithfully meets up with her fellowship* co-members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and pay microfinance

She is married to Ireneo L., an auto electrician, and is the mother of an elementary-aged child. By the grace of God, Lorence has managed to support her child's schooling. At this time, she is working hard to be able to send her child all the way through college. This is the dream of most Filipino parents like Lorence, who herself has been a college undergraduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents could leave to their children.\r\n<br>Lorence operates a meat shop where she also sells native milkfish delicacies such as boneless ones, meat-filled ones, and other products of the like. For her meat shop, she buys live pigs from hog-raisers. The pigs are then slaughtered and sold to the immediate community. She has many customers who buy the cut meat and then sell it on their respective market stalls. There are many customers who prefer Lorence\u2019s products since they are assured of their freshness and cleanliness. It is also a little cheaper to buy meat from an independent meat shop than the ones in the market that sometimes use the services of professional slaughterhouses for their meat. The cost of slaughter is added to the final price of the cut meat, and passed along to the customers. Thus, Lorence has many customers who regularly anticipate her meat and processed milkfish. Her regular customers are her neighbors and local community members. She earns a minimum of 600 PHP in sales every day.\r\n<br>To help her continue to operate her business, Lorence is requesting a loan of 22,000 PHP. She will use the loan to buy live pigs to be slaughtered and sold every day. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. Lorence dreams of being able to give her child a good, high quality education through all her hard work in her business. She also hopes to have her own market stall someday. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n<p>\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that sells groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal in the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy a sachet of shampoo, 5 PHP-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Beatriz earns an income by purchasing supplies at wholesale prices and selling at piece rate. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and local community members. She earns a minimum of 400 PHP in sales every day.\r\n<br>To help her continue to operate her business, Beatriz is requesting a loan of 39,000 PHP. She will use the loan to buy more groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.

is Anita T., 39, a resident of Pasay City, Philippines. She is married to Frederick, and is the mother of two children, both of whom are in high school. At this time, she is working hard to be able to send both her children all the way through college. This is the dream of most Filipino parents like Anita, who herself has been a college undergraduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents could leave to their children.\r\n<br>Anita operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that sells groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal in the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy a sachet of shampoo, 5 PHP-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Anita earns an income by purchasing supplies at wholesale prices and selling at piece rate. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and local community members. She earns a minimum of 400 PHP in sales every day.\r\n<br>To help her continue to operate her business, she is requesting a loan of 19,000 PHP. She will use the loan to buy more groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. Anita dreams of having new businesses in the future. She also prays for good health for her and her family. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n<p>\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance

He lives with his wife and child in the Massablacoura  neighborhood of Bougouni.  Not having attended a modern school, at a young age he embarked on activities that would generate an income, such as selling clothing. That business was not successful for him. Then, he decided to observe his uncle to learn about selling grocery items in a store. After more than two years of experience, Mr. Bourama Konat\u00e9 has mastered his business. In order to obtain a consistent working capital, he decided to affiliate with the Soro Yiriwaso loan program to buy a variety of grocery items for his store. This is his first loan with Soro Yiriwaso.  He gets his supplies in Bamako (capital of the republic of Mali) from wholesalers.  His customers come from the local population.  He expects to make a monthly profit of 40,000 CFA with this loan.  He wants to use the loan to expand his store. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Connie Archea, Kiva

In order to support himself, he used a cart to transport the merchandise of Bougouni shopkeepers. After reflecting at length, he decided to learn about the business of buying and selling festival items, shoes and clothing, from his friend. After saving for a few years and with the help of some friends, he decided to open a ready-to-wear shop. After 6 years of experience, he has mastered his business. Within the framework of expanding his business, he decided to affiliate with the Soro Yiriwaso loan program which he knew about from a friend.  He plans to buy shoes, shirt and pants with this loan.  He gets his supplies in Bamako (capital of the Republic of Mali). His clientele is made up of men and women. Religious holidays and important ceremonies (baptism, marriages) are the periods when his sales are the highest.  He expects to make a monthly profit of 50,000 CFA with this loan.  Mr. Sidib\u00e9 hopes to expand his shop in the future.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Connie Archea, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":597122,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy shoes, shirts and pants","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Bougouni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.416667 -7.483333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adama ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":300000,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2010-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2011-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2011-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":75000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":150,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:50Z","rounded_local_amount":77523.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177476856,"comment":null},{"amount":150,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:43:14Z","rounded_local_amount":77523.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188751997,"comment":null},{"amount":150,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2011-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:20:32Z","rounded_local_amount":77523.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195917923,"comment":null},{"amount":150,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2011-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-16T08:17:51Z","rounded_local_amount":77523.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206226185,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-10-09T09:31:50Z","paid_date":"2011-05-16T08:17:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":229709,"name":"Marat","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marat H. is 32 years old and lives with his wife and three daughters in Bayan-Ulgiy province in western Mongolia.

He is 50 years old, married and the father of 12 children between 7 and 28 years of age.  He went to school until 5th grade and didn't continue due to the distance between his home and the middle school. He lives in his own house with his family and supports his parents who live with him. \r\n\r\nHe left Inhambane to Namaacha looking for a job. After 12 years working as a guard he started a business selling pots. He managed to build two houses given that he has two wives and to buy a car to help him in his job. Currently, besides selling pots he also transports people in his area making 200.00 meticais per day. He also raises chickens and spends 50,000 meticais to raise 800 chicks. He has an income of 15,000 meticais which is applied towards household expenses. He saves around 2,000 to 3,000 meticais in his bank account. \r\n\r\nThis is Jequicene's third loan with Hluvuku and Kiva. It is for 22,000 meticais and will be used to purchase chicks, feed and vitamins to increase his flock. The two first loans (for 18,000 and 22,000 meticais) were used for the same goal. He is confident he will pay the loan back ahead of schedule and request another loan to build a shop to sell pots. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Betyna

The school is staffed with thirteen teachers and children between the classes of five and six from all primary schools in Makeni attend the school on alternate days of the week. \r\n\r\nThese hardworking and dedicated teachers have come to SMT, to seek a loan of SLL 3,000,000. This is not the first SMT loan that these teachers have benefited from: previous loans have made a lot of improvements in the lives of these borrowers. \r\n\r\nHelen F. (pictured second from the right) is the headmistresses and leader of this group of teachers. She is age forty-nine and has been in the teaching profession for twenty-four years now. She is married to a lecturer and they have four children, all of whom are in college.

The previous loans (for 7,000, 15,000 and 15,000 meticais) were used for the same goal. \r\n\r\nHer goal for the future is to build a beauty salon and a boutique and to stop only selling through

She lives in her own home with her son and supports three nephews\/nieces who live with her. \r\n\r\nAfter finishing her teacher's training she decided to build her house.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

G. is a married woman who lives in Barangay Palanas, Ginatilan, Cebu. She earns her living by operating three business ventures: fish vending, hog raising and farming. Her husband, Pepito G., who is 45 years old, works as a fisherman and carpenter to earn his living. They have five children who are from 10 to 25 years old.\r\n\r\nWendy joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she wished for something better for her family. With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, she has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 14,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.\r\n\r\nThis time, for her 5th loan, Wendy is borrowing PHP 16,000 which she intends to use as additional capital for her business so that she can continue to save for the future college education of her children.\r\n\r\nWendy is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\r\nHelp NWTF continue in its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by visiting the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/team\/nwtf_philippines\" target=\"_blank\">NWTF lending team<\/a>

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the country's already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<p>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<p>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<p>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C.

is Melitona P., 58, a resident of Caloocan City, Philippines. She is married to Eugenio P. Sr. and mother to three young hard-working adults. By the grace of God, Melitona has managed to support her children's schooling up to college level. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nMelitona operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go for to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 Philippine pesos (PHP) worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling in piece rate.  Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a  minimum of 200 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting an 8,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n  \r\nMelitona dreams of being able to renovate her house soon, with all of her work with the business.

Florence sells her products in a retail shop. Florence has requested a loan of 500,000 Ugandan Shillings from MCDT SACCO, which she will use to buy boxes of creams and relaxer braids. The main business challenges for Florence include the rainy season and transportation of boxes of cosmetics from Kikuubo in the city of Kampala to her shop in Nakulabye.

Mar\u00eda's store is the first to open its doors every morning.   Starting at 6 am she is ready to receive her early morning shoppers who appreciate the variety of merchandise that she offers in her store.  They don't have any doubts about shopping at her store since they are sure that they are going to find what they need.  What she likes most about her job is talking with her customers and finding out what is going on in the village.  She has been running her store for 23 years, however, the most difficult part of her job is having to stay in the store all day without being able to leave.   She knows, however,  that sacrifice has its rewards.  In time, she would like to see her business grow and to offer her customers better service.  \r\n\r\nThis is her fourth loan with MFP.

She is a very unpretentious and hard working woman. She lives in her own home together with her husband Florencio, 50 years old, and their 5 young children. She wishes to proviD. them with a better quality of life. Aqueliza has an apiary and it is a source of income and thanks to the honey they produce she has been able to earn enough money to support the family. She has one year in the business. She sells the honey very quickly, a product highly sought out by her clients. She really enjoys her work especially because when she feels hungry all she needs to do is open one of the plastic recipients and eat her product. Her least favorite part is having to walk long distances to sell the product. She knows she has to work hard and one day be able to open a more stable business. This is her fourth loan through MFP (Kiva Field Partner). She is aware of the responsibilities of the loan and she is ready to fulfill them. She is a very attentive and involved member in her community bank. With the five hundred nuevos soles she requests she plans on supplementing her working capital to purchase more honey. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Erika Lindig, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":597326,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase honey.

She is a very unpretentious and hard working woman. She lives in her own home together with her husband Wilmer, 42 years old, and their two beloved children. They are the reason for all of her efforts. With arduous work Leonor has managed to provide for her family by working the fields. Before the first rays of sun she walks close to an hour to reach her fields. There she has planted potatoes, corn, and sweet peas. She takes the harvest all the way to the city of Tarma to sell in the wholesale market. What she most enjoys about her work is cultivating the fields, especially because it has given them positive results. She has 20 years' experience in the business. The most difficult part of the work is having to transport her products to the city of Tarma. The sacks she carries are very heavy and it drains her energy. In time she hopes to purchase more land to increase production. This is her third loan with MFP (Kiva Field Partner). She is very happy to have access to this loan and she would like to thank all the people that make this possible. In her community bank she is a very well respected member for the organization she brings to the meetings.

He knows that the higher the quality of his produce, the better the price he can get at the market in Tarma. What he likes best about the work is harvesting the crop, when he can see the fruits of his months of hard work. He has been working in this business for 35 years, and considers the greatest challenge to be spraying the crops, because there is always the danger that the chemicals will cause him harm. \r\n\r\nIn time he would like to buy more land. This is Mateo's 6th loan from [field partner] MFP, and he says that this support will be a great help in progressing his business. Mateo is known as a responsible and respected member of his communal bank. With the 2,000 Soles [$725], he will buy seeds for maize and peasm because those are the crops that will sell best this season.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Rosa Oswald, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":597363,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy seeds for growing maize and peas","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-09-08T22:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mateo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":725,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:33:10Z","rounded_local_amount":2029.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206195555,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-09-11T18:18:02Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T11:33:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":229858,"name":"Felicitas","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nLa socia pertenece al banco comunal \u201cPADRE URRACA\u201d; Este banco est\u00e1 situado en el distrito de Huanchac perteneciente a la provincia de Cusco y departamento de Cusco.\n\nLa socia Felicitas; tiene 48 a\u00f1os de edad y es madre soltera, ella tiene 1 hijos  trabaja vendiendo productos de belleza por catalogo, La socia trabaja como auxiliar contable en un estudio de contadores, ella paralelamente alterna su trabajo con la venta de productos de belleza por catalogo.

Her dream is to build her own house with concrete block and a roof.\r\n\r\nThis Esperanza associate began with us because she wanted to improve her business. Her story is representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican clients, many of whom recently emigrated to the Dominican Republic from Haiti.

Vende ropa de todo tipo, su sistema de ventas es de puerta en puerta y tambi\u00e9n entrega en su casa, dice que deja a cr\u00e9dito y  hace sus cobros semanalmente, lo cual es una ventaja dice, porque al dejar a cr\u00e9dito incrementa m\u00e1s el precio y le queda m\u00e1s ganancias, adem\u00e1s que al hacer sus cobros realiza nuevas ventas. Trabaja tres d\u00edas a la semana unas cuatro horas ya que tiene que atender su hogar y  a sus hijos. Compra sus mercader\u00edas en Guayaquil, ciudad a la que viaja una o dos veces al mes dependiendo de sus ventas.\n \nEste cr\u00e9dito lo va a emplear en comprar una parte en ropa y otra parte para comprar billetes de loter\u00eda. Es su primer ciclo en este Banco  aunque ya lleva varios a\u00f1os como socia de la Fundaci\u00f3n Espoir.\n \nSu sue\u00f1o es terminar su casa que aun la tiene en construcci\u00f3n.\n","en":"The communal bank 30 de Agosto meets in the Picoaza parish in the city of Portoviejo. It is known for being a very commercial area, for its traditional Saint Peter and Saint Paul festivals, and for its people's cheerfulness.  \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda is 31 years old and has been in a relationship for 9 years. She has three children from that relationship. The youngest is a beautiful 10 month old baby girl who is the center of attention in the house. Her husband sells lottery tickets.  \r\n\r\nOur member is a housewife. In order to help her husband with the household expenses, she decided to start her own business selling clothing and lottery tickets. She sells all types of clothing door to door. She also delivers clothing to people's homes. She says that she sells the clothes on credit and collects every week. This is an advantage, she says, because selling on credit increases the price and she makes more profit. In addition, when she collects, she makes more sales. She works three days a week for about four hours, since she has to attend to her home and her chidlren. She buys her merchandise in Guayaquil, where she travels once or twice a month, depending on her sales.  \r\n \r\nShe is going to use this loan in part for clothing and in part to buy lottery tickets. This is her first cycle in this bank, although she has been a member of Fundaci\u00f3n Espoir for several years.\r\n \r\nHer dream is to finish her house, which is still under construction. \r\n<br

She has been a member of the community bank for four loan cycles  and she hopes to continue on with them. \r\n\r\nHer goal is to purchase a car and carry out some home improvements. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Erika Lindig, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":597503,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To purchase clothing, cosmetics and perfumes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-09-09T18:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cruz Mar\u00eda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":495,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":61.88},{"due_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":61.88},{"due_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":61.88},{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":61.88},{"due_date":"2010-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":61.88},{"due_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":61.88},{"due_date":"2010-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":61.88},{"due_date":"2011-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":61.84}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.51},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.51},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.51},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.51},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.46}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":62.51,"local_amount":61.88,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:07:11Z","rounded_local_amount":62.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172113606,"comment":null},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":61.88,"processed_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:57:31Z","rounded_local_amount":62.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177407365,"comment":null},{"amount":62.51,"local_amount":61.88,"processed_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:58:25Z","rounded_local_amount":62.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177407366,"comment":null},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":61.88,"processed_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-21T10:29:44Z","rounded_local_amount":62.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":183388486,"comment":null},{"amount":62.51,"local_amount":61.88,"processed_date":"2010-11-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-21T10:30:28Z","rounded_local_amount":62.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":183388487,"comment":null},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":61.88,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-21T10:31:45Z","rounded_local_amount":62.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":183388488,"comment":null},{"amount":62.51,"local_amount":61.88,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:10:34Z","rounded_local_amount":62.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188682882,"comment":null},{"amount":62.46,"local_amount":61.84,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:32:59Z","rounded_local_amount":62.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191422006,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-09-15T16:02:37Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T03:32:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":229926,"name":"Venus","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Venus M. is a married woman with two children who are four and eight years old.

G. is a married woman who lives in Bato, Samboan, Cebu. She earns her living by operating a business venture to buy and sell scrap gold. Her husband Falconiere G., who is 54 years old, works as a welder to earn his living. They have 2 children who are 31 and 34 years old. Rebecca joined NWTF- Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 4 loans from NWTF- Project Dungganon, Rebecca has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 11,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 12,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 5th loan, she is borrowing PHP 11,000 which she intends to use as additional capital for the business so that she can continue to save up for the future and to support the maintenance of the family.  Rebecca G. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. Her photo was taken during the end of her weekly center meeting because her scrap gold was already sold.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon- a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She lives in Orchids St., Brgy. Gairan, Bogo City, Cebu. She has been a member of NWTF- Project Dungganon since 2010 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her fish vending business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 9,000. Amalia is now borrowing PHP 10,000 so that she can purchase more fish to sell.  This will be her 2nd loan from NWTF- Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 4,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom. Amalia aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and to ensure their future well-being by following the  Dungganon way.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon- a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Gairan, Bogo City, Cebu. She earns her living by operating a business selling fish. Her husband Jose Stephen U. Jr., who is 40 years old, works as a clerk to earn his living. They have three children who are 2 to 15 years old. Amelita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2010 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Amelita  has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 4,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 800, thus uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her second cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000, which she intends to use as additional capital for her fish selling business so that she can continue to save up for future home repairs. Amelita U. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

Poblacion, Oslob, Cebu. She earns her living with a fish vending business. Melania joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she wanted something better for her family. With the help of her past eleven loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, and by the sweat of her brow, Melania has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty. Her previous loan of 15,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of 8,000 PHP, thus improving her family's standard of living. This time, for her twelfth loan, she is borrowing 15,000 PHP. She intends to use the additional capital for the business so that she can continue to save up for the future and support the needs of her family.

P. is a single woman who lives in Proper Bakhawan, Barangay Bakhawan, Daanbantayan, Cebu. She earns her living by operating a general store. Remedios joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 3 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Remedios  has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 7,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 4th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000 which she intends to use to buy stocks for the general store so that she can continue to save up for the future and the business. Remedios P. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

Even highly-developed, industrial, economically self-sufficient states are confronted by difficulties. It\u2019s the same with the developing country, Kyrgyzstan. But it\u2019s not a forcible argument to stop working, stop earning money and suffer losses. People want to live happily against all the odds.\r\n\r\nDamira K. is the leader of this group. She is 33. Together with her husband, who earns his livelihood by working as a private builder, she brings up four sons, all in school.\r\n\r\nBesides working in the sphere of passport documentation, Damira runs a family business. Thirteen years ago, having some money saved, she and her husband began their business. The very first step was starting to breed cattle; the second was to increase the number of cattle.\r\n\r\nWith money received from the loan Damira wants to purchase more cattle. In the future, she wants to widen the shed to enable her to keep more cattle and, in order to improve the family\u2019s housing conditions, make thorough house repairs.\r\n\r\nDamira's partners are:\r\n\r\nAigul D., 29, a private entrepreneur, is married and has three children. She opened a shop after getting some money from her husband. Her aim is to extend her business. She wants to expand the assortment of goods and to make major shop repairs.\r\n\r\nZarema K., 32, is married to a builder and has no children. She and her husband earn their living by selling goods in the market. After earning a profit, they bought a refrigerator and a washing machine. The aim of the loan is to expand her assortment of goods. In future she hopes to rent a container.\r\n\r\nKauhar M., 30, is the treasurer of the group. She is married and has five children. She began her business with selling ice-cream. As the business developed, she also began to sell disks and audio cassettes. Her aim is to extend her business. She intents to finish a new house she is building.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---<\/b>\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of the 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable in order to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

Her daughter does embroidery, and her brother sells costume jewelry in his shop at the nearby market.\r\n \r\nParveen has applied for a loan from Asasah to buy more clothes for selling. Her daughter is near marrying age, and it is Parveen\u2019s responsibility to marry her. She is hopeful that with the increased profit of her business she will collect the dowry and marry her daughter. This is her first loan and she hopes that it will bring positive changes to her business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":597731,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To buy clothes for reselling.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PK","country":"Pakistan","town":"Lahore","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"31.549722 74.343611","type":"point"}},"partner_id":60,"posted_date":"2010-09-11T19:10:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Parveen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rukhsana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Shaheen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PKR","disbursal_amount":47000,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":4273},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4273},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4273},{"due_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":4273},{"due_date":"2011-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":4273},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4273},{"due_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":4273},{"due_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4273},{"due_date":"2011-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4273},{"due_date":"2011-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":4273},{"due_date":"2011-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":4270}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.01},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.01},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.01},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.97}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":4273,"processed_date":"2010-10-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T12:56:55Z","rounded_local_amount":4280.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177360468,"comment":null},{"amount":50.01,"local_amount":4273,"processed_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T12:59:15Z","rounded_local_amount":4280.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182495121,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":4273,"processed_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:21:48Z","rounded_local_amount":4280.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188630045,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":4273,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:25:25Z","rounded_local_amount":4280.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188630046,"comment":null},{"amount":50.01,"local_amount":4273,"processed_date":"2011-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T01:37:59Z","rounded_local_amount":4280.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191372963,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":4273,"processed_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:13:12Z","rounded_local_amount":4280.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201232214,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":4273,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:16:45Z","rounded_local_amount":4280.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201232215,"comment":null},{"amount":50.01,"local_amount":4273,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:14:22Z","rounded_local_amount":4280.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206098645,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":4273,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:35:48Z","rounded_local_amount":4280.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211169048,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":4273,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:34:04Z","rounded_local_amount":4280.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216451792,"comment":null},{"amount":49.97,"local_amount":4270,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:19:13Z","rounded_local_amount":4277.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221615747,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-09-12T16:11:25Z","paid_date":"2011-08-15T08:19:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":230033,"name":"Charles","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Charles is a 30-year-old man living in Fort Portal, Uganda.

Ilyne has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6000 PHP from ASKI, and now requests a 8000 PHP loan to purchase fertilizer such as manure.\r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":597604,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Culing Centro Cabatuan, Isabela","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":123,"posted_date":"2010-09-11T19:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ilyne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":334},{"due_date":"2010-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":334},{"due_date":"2010-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":334},{"due_date":"2010-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":334},{"due_date":"2010-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":334},{"due_date":"2010-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":334},{"due_date":"2010-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":334},{"due_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":334},{"due_date":"2010-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":334},{"due_date":"2010-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":334},{"due_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":334},{"due_date":"2010-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":334},{"due_date":"2010-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":334},{"due_date":"2010-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":334},{"due_date":"2010-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":334},{"due_date":"2010-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":334},{"due_date":"2010-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":334},{"due_date":"2010-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":334},{"due_date":"2010-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":334},{"due_date":"2010-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":334},{"due_date":"2010-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":334},{"due_date":"2011-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":334},{"due_date":"2011-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":334},{"due_date":"2011-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":318}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.35},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.35},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.35},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.35},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.35},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.35},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.35},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.35},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.35},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.35},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.35},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.35},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.35},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.35},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.35},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.35},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.35},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.35},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.35},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.35},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.35},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.35},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.35},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":7.95}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":66.8,"local_amount":2672,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:29:03Z","rounded_local_amount":2946.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172048991,"comment":null},{"amount":33.4,"local_amount":1336,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T12:23:40Z","rounded_local_amount":1473.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177339714,"comment":null},{"amount":33.4,"local_amount":1336,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T12:22:25Z","rounded_local_amount":1473.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182474530,"comment":null},{"amount":41.75,"local_amount":1670,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T11:54:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1841.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188611358,"comment":null},{"amount":24.65,"local_amount":986,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T01:10:22Z","rounded_local_amount":1087.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191356242,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-09-12T13:11:57Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T01:10:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":230037,"name":"Stephen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Stephen is a 47-year-old man living in Fort Portal, Uganda.
