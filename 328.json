55, and her husband Domingo are busy with their lives and for good reason, they have three businesses:  a sidecar service, a vegetable stand, and bed space for rent. They are blessed with two children, one who is now working and the other one who passed away.\r\n\r\nRosita has been a regular member of Center for Community Transformation* (CCT) for more than three years now. She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she was able to borrow several times from CCT\u2019s Cooperative. The reason why she was consistent in paying her loans was because she used almost all of the money she borrowed to improve her business. \r\n\r\nNow with your help, she would like to apply for a PHP 19,000 loan. This amount will be mostly used  to buy an additional pedi-cab for their transportation service and to increase vegetable stocks for more profits. \r\n\r\nShe dreams that all her businesses will continue to grow so that they can have more savings and see more opportunities to start new businesses in the future.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":450902,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Rickshaw","sector":"Transportation","use":"To

Aida has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2009, Aida joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Aida has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Aida is requesting a new loan of 8000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by Aida from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n<p>\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

business-minded woman, Imelda Camaraeg is 30 years old and the mother of two (2) daughters and two (2) sons. She is married to Joserizal M., who is 33 years old, but her husband is living with another woman. Therefore, Imelda is now the head of the family and the provider for her four (4) children. She lives in Antipolo, in the province of Rizal, Philippines. \r\n<p>\r\nWith her faith to get out of poverty, Imelda decided in 2008 to join ASHI (Ahon SA Hirap, Inc.), a microfinance institution and Kiva partner in the Philippines, for the chance to have start-up capital for generating income. During her 1st, 2nd, and 3rd loans with ASHI, she carefully invested in the buying and selling of Avon products. The profit is what she uses for daily expenses and to meet the educational needs of her children. Now for her 4th loan, she proposes to borrow Php 20,000.00 pesos for a broader business. Specifically, the amount will be use to purchase body lotion, lipstick, pressed powder, cologne, bras, underwear for all ages, etc. Imelda is very determined and disciplined to use the money which was lent to her in her previous loans from ASHI. \r\n<p>\r\nShe still dreams of the best for her family, especially to provide the best education for her children and have a happy family. During almost two (2) years in ASHI, Lolita has shown herself to be hard-working and strong-minded for making her dreams come true. She hopes that her business will expand so here children will have savings for future use. She is grateful to ASHI for supporting people like her who wants to grow their standard of living. She is also happy seeing that the loans from ASHI changes their lives and accommodate their financial means needed to support her families. She wishes ASHI and all lenders all the best and hopes they will keep on supporting her family and other families who are in need.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":453564,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics

D. is from the village of Capellan,Ilagan,Isabela.

With her vending business, she earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month.\n\nEstefania joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be her ninth loan taken out from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \n\n\nAbout ASKI:\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\n\n\n *Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

P. is from the village of Alibagu,Ilagan,Isabela. She is 47 years old, married, and has school-aged children.\n\nGertrudes owns and operates a furniture making business, making and selling furniture to local businesses and community members. With these activities, she earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month.\n\nIn 2006, Gertrudes joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to purchase raw materials to make additional furnitures. This loan will be her eighth loan taken out from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \n\n\nAbout ASKI:\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\n\n\n *Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":453448,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture

V. is from the village of Alibagu,Ilagan,Isabela. She is 46 years old, married, and has children.\n\nEstrella owns and operates a general store, selling a variety of different products in the local community. She earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month with these activities.\n\nIn 2008, Estrella joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be her third loan taken out from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business.\n\n\nAbout ASKI:\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\n\n\n *Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

She is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be her third loan taken out from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \n\n\nAbout ASKI:\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\n\n\n *Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She was given hope and access to capital, so she started her frozen foods business. The business has been going smoothly and ensures good income for the family. Carolina would like to continue the business and invest more in it.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Carolina is on her 6th loan, borrowing PHP 30,000 as additional capital to purchase stock and more supplies for her Frozen Foods Business. Stock includes tocino, embutido, hotdogs, longganisa, ham, meat loaf, tapa, and other supplies. Carolina has disciplined herself to use all of the borrowed capital from ASHI-KIVA for her business, to gain more profit and to use that profit to cover the daily expenses.\r\n\r\nDuring the past 6 years that she has been a member of ASHI, Carolina has been able to make it possible to send her children to school, so that they can obtain a degree in the future and be able to provide for their families. Carolina is very thankful to ASHI for the kind hearted support of her dreams and hopes to be able to eventually afford to build or purchase a house for her family.

Hikmatullo lives in Shahrituz, Tajikistan where he was born in 1958. With God's help, he has become an excellent supplier of vegetables for his community. He is responsible for seven people (his wife and six children) and earns his family's living with his farming. Hikmatullo knows all the ins and outs of this business. He has 13 years of experience. His greatest triumph is his production of vegetables in the off-season. However, in order to accomplish this, he needs to purchase seeds and mineral fertilizer. For this reason, he is requesting a loan of $3,000 USD to be able to supply enough vegetables to meet the demand. This will allow him to better provide for his family. Let's help Hikmatullo as he works hard to improve the quality of life for his family.   \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The city was declared Patrimony of Humanity and archaeological capital of the Americas. \r\n\r\nIrma is 54 years old. She\u2019s a single mother of three, although they are all independent now. She divides her time between her household activities and her retail wood store located in Puerto Maldonado and her tamales stand (typical Peruvian dish, maD. of white corn). She sells tamales on the busses that go south of Cusco, from 6am to 5pm. She's been doing this for many years with great success, thanks to her hard work. She\u2019s a working mother and an entrepreneur trying to support her family.

The name of the bank has its origin in the Quechua language and translated into Spanish, means \"Cerro de Oro\" (Golden Hill).\r\n\r\nGraciela is 43 years old, married and has 5 children that are dependent upon her: Kelly is 24 and studies hotel administration in the Instituto Superior, Anali is 23 and studies in the Instituto \"San Rosa\" to become a teacher, Jonatan is 17 and studies in the pre-entrance program of the National San Antonio Abad del Cusco University, Libeth and Roxana study in school.  \r\n\r\nGraciela alternates her activities in the home with her business selling bread.  She has her own stand in the vicinity of the Plaza de Armos in Urcos.  She tells us that  from the time that she was very young she sold bread along with her mother from 4am until 9pm every day, but now she is independent.  She rents an oven with a number of business partners and there she makes her own bread.  Two years ago, she and her partners had the idea to make a special bread that they call \"chuta navide\u00f1a\" that has the same characteristics of the chuta bread (a bread typically sold in Cusco that is soft and round and very large and has a characteristic aroma) but they add fruit and raisins.  She has had her business selling chuta bread for a number of years now, and it has gone very well, thanks to all of the effort that she puts into her work.  She is an enterprising and hardworking woman who, in spite of the difficulties in life, is managing to help her children become professionals.  She needs a loan to buy more supplies such as flour, sugar, butter, fruit and raisins to prepare the chutas navide\u00f1as for the Christmas festivities, since this is the season when she can increase her sales.\r\n\r\nShe is very grateful for the opportunity provided through these means, and pledges to make her payments on time.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":453762,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","use":"to buy supplies such as flour, sugar, butter, fruit and raisins to prepare the \u201cchutas navide\u00f1as\u201d for the Christmas festivities","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Urcos - Quispicanchi - Cusco","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":119,"posted_date":"2009-12-21T17:00:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Graciela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":75.38},{"due_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":78.39},{"due_date":"2010-03-14T08:00:00Z","amount":81.53},{"due_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":84.79},{"due_date":"2010-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":88.18},{"due_date":"2010-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":91.73}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.38},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.44},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.54},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.86},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.11}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":26.38,"local_amount":75.38,"processed_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T10:42:28Z","rounded_local_amount":75.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118034413,"comment":null},{"amount":27.44,"local_amount":78.42,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:04:42Z","rounded_local_amount":79.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123872509,"comment":null},{"amount":28.54,"local_amount":81.54,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:19:12Z","rounded_local_amount":82.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128905768,"comment":null},{"amount":29.67,"local_amount":84.8,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:49:22Z","rounded_local_amount":85.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136633241,"comment":null},{"amount":30.86,"local_amount":88.19,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:49:05Z","rounded_local_amount":88.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144667708,"comment":null},{"amount":32.11,"local_amount":91.67,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:24:14Z","rounded_local_amount":92.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151851450,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-12-21T18:36:18Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T09:24:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":164050,"name":"Bernabe","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Sr. Bernab\u00e9 es oriundo de la Paz, actualmente vive en la comunidad de la Pampa del Coscal desde hace 15 a\u00f1os tiene su se\u00f1ora esposa y cinco hijos donde trabajan en la agricultura.\n\nEl cliente produce en su propiedad ma\u00edz, man\u00ed y poroto,y luego comercializara sus productos en el mercado de su localidad, el cr\u00e9dito solicitado es para incrementar su capital de trabajo.\n\nEl cliente esta agradecido con la institucion por el apoyo brindado.        \n","en":"Mr. Bernabe is a native of La Paz but has actually lived in the community of La Pampa del Coscal for 15 years.

She has been a retailer for the past four years, selling cloth and ready-to-wear clothing. She is a parent beneficiary, married and mother of two. The moments that give her most pleasure are when she selects and buys her supplies at the Sandaga market in Dakar.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan for 150,000 francs to increase her stock of merchandise during this period of preparing for Tabaski and year-end celebrations. She hopes with this loan to improve her business by increasing her profits and working capital.\r\n\r\nMrs. D. is a beneficiary of the Protocol between U-IMCEC and the Development Program for Children and Families \"Seydina Issa Laye\". This program seeks to decrease poverty within the community and above all protect children from impoverished families. Thanks to this cooperation, beneficiary parents can obtain credit under more flexible conditions than with ordinary credit. Since this protocal started in December 2008, 120 parents have obtained financing for sums ranging from 50,000 to 150,000 francs.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ren\u00e9 McConnell, Kiva

She has her own place of work in the surrounding area of the main square of Urcos. She explained to us that since a young age she helped her mother in daily activity of making bread and selling it, although today she is working independently. She rents an oven along with other fellow business persons and this is where they make their bread. Two years ago, she and her colleagues decided to create a special type of bread that they named \"chuta navide\u00f1a\" which has the same characteristics of the flat bread named 'chuta' (a large, soft, round bread with a specific smell) but with the addition of fruits. This member and her business colleagues only prepare this \"Chuta navide\u00f1a\" for the christmas holidays.

For the last three years she has dedicated herself to the sale of beer from her home, which is undertakes with enthusiasm because it allows her to be independent. She also sells crates of these drinks from her home to the stores in her neighborhood, as well as when it is requested for all types of celebrations. This activity is very tiring as it requires a lot of transportation on her part, most of which she does alone, although sometimes her son helps. She is very comforted by her work which brings her much satisfaction, thanks to the good customers she has. As she is a very active woman she is always thinking about how to improve her business in order to improve her life and benefit her family. She is asking for a loan from MFP and promises to be punctual with each of her reimbursements. With the money from this loan she will purchase more crates and beer, and in this way hopes to gain more profits from the end of the year celebrations which are very soon.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Chloe Tuot, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":453853,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchase larger quantities of merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-12-21T20:30:20Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bremilda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":221.95},{"due_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":230.31},{"due_date":"2010-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":247.79},{"due_date":"2010-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":255.74},{"due_date":"2010-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":267.25},{"due_date":"2010-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":276.96}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.68},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.61},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.73},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.51},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.53},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.94}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":77.68,"local_amount":221.95,"processed_date":"2010-01-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:17Z","rounded_local_amount":223.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124320,"comment":null},{"amount":80.61,"local_amount":230.31,"processed_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:48:46Z","rounded_local_amount":232.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123960062,"comment":null},{"amount":86.73,"local_amount":247.79,"processed_date":"2010-03-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:40Z","rounded_local_amount":249.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992906,"comment":null},{"amount":89.51,"local_amount":255.74,"processed_date":"2010-04-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:09Z","rounded_local_amount":257.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717692,"comment":null},{"amount":93.53,"local_amount":267.25,"processed_date":"2010-05-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:17Z","rounded_local_amount":269.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751372,"comment":null},{"amount":96.94,"local_amount":276.96,"processed_date":"2010-06-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:30Z","rounded_local_amount":279.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151933843,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-12-25T19:58:29Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":164075,"name":"Agbalevi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. K. runs a restaurant called Chez Mami in the B\u00e9 quarter of Lom\u00e9.

She has been a seamstress for the last 31 years, an activity she began to be able to contribute to her family's income since she needed to see them get ahead.  Like any responsible and committed mother she needed to do whatever was necessary to accomplish this.  During the mornings she would sew her garments and during the afternoons would go out to sell them.  This was most fatiguing but her desire to support her children motivated her to continue to forge ahead.  Currently, she needs financing to buy fabric, thread, needles, buttons and lace.

This loan will increase and better production when harvesting time comes. \r\n\r\nThis is the second loan Jose requests from Kiva partner FUDECOSUR. He first obtained a loan of CRC 250,000 that he repaid in time. The first loan helped Jose a lot, since before FUDECOSUR, the only lenders in the area charged high interests. Jose wants his business to be well prepared so that he can earn enough to provide his family with enough for household expenditures and schooling for his children. Jose's wife works in the Fila Naranja credit committee.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Violeta Rubiani, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":721.73,"image":{"id":453906,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Replant and fertilize two hectares of coffee","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Fila Naranja","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":150,"posted_date":"2009-12-21T20:20:20Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jose Pablo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":600000,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2011-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":200000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":358.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":358.34},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":358.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":358.33,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2010-12-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-19T09:48:15Z","rounded_local_amount":200555.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189143452,"comment":null},{"amount":358.34,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2011-12-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:01:08Z","rounded_local_amount":200555.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250772693,"comment":null},{"amount":5.06,"local_amount":2825.74,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:26:27Z","rounded_local_amount":2833.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263315633,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-12-23T05:34:35Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":164088,"name":"Gloria Betty","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Sra.

They all live together in their own home and strive to get ahead in life.  For the last 5 years she has sold grocery items from a store that she set up in her home.  Maria begins her work every morning accompanied by her youngest daughter, who helps out when she has the time.  She also works as a seamstress.  She set up a sewing machine in the store from where she sews garments at a reasonable price for whomever needs them.  As if this weren't enough, this hard-working woman occasionally takes in laundry for people who need this service.  Her desire to get ahead is never lacking.  She proves this because she never tires of working even though she has three adult children; she always wants to have a better quality of life.  For the future, she would like to enlarge her store and stock it with a greater variety and quality of products.  This is her 8th loan with MFP and she is committed to make her repayments punctually for, as she states, she is an honest woman.  Besides, she is very pleased with the work she does with her communal bank since together they all move forward responsibly with each loan.  The funds requested now will be used to buy stock items for her store so that she can start her expansion and improvement project.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":453951,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"To buy stock inventory.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-12-21T20:00:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":300,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":20.83,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2009-12-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:24:00Z","rounded_local_amount":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734990,"comment":null},{"amount":20.84,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2010-01-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:38Z","rounded_local_amount":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124326,"comment":null},{"amount":20.83,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:15Z","rounded_local_amount":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123960068,"comment":null},{"amount":20.83,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2010-03-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:13Z","rounded_local_amount":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992912,"comment":null},{"amount":20.84,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2010-04-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:53Z","rounded_local_amount":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717698,"comment":null},{"amount":20.83,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:39Z","rounded_local_amount":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751378,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-12-21T21:14:43Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":164099,"name":"Nuevo Amanecer Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El  Grupo Solidario Nuevo Amanecer, se encuentra en su treinta ava secuencia, esta integrado por tres personas, la Sra.

Several neighbors formed the group as they have known each other for a few years and from there they began meeting every Sunday afternoon. They help each other and together they are learning how to build their Committee. On average they each receive 580952 G, which will be invested in buying articles that will be sold in their respective commercial businesses. Estelvina\u2019s family sells plants as they have the ability to sell since the father works as a gardener in various houses in the city. Today with the loan that they received through the Foundation they were able to open a small nursery on the patio of their house. The nursery has plants from Caba\u00f1as city which is 50 km from San Lorenzo. Hopefully with this improvement we can improve our standard of living and that the Foundation will continue helping us as well as other deserving families. \r\n1. Herminia C. sells cosmetics. \r\n2.

Guarani) was born a year ago after some women who already had experience working in a group, decided to start anew. The women come from the hamlet of Marquetalia, and are strict about following the rules of the group, thanks to which they have been able to pay all of their loans with an excellent record. On average, each member receives Gs. 635,924 (approx. U$D 140) which will buy supplies and products that each member will sell in their respective business. \r\nThe hamlet's families are very poor, but still they have continued to survive and fulfill the needs that every family has thanks to the effort of the women who will take on any job to support and feed their children. \r\n\r\nThere are many women in this community like Mercedes, who is a single mother of three children. She currently collects materials to recycle, but with a loan from Kiva partner Fundaci\u00f3n Paraguaya, she was able to start a business selling \"empanadas\" (turnovers) at a street vending stand. Thanks to her stand, she no longer needs to make so many sacrifices and for that, she is thankful to the Fundaci\u00f3n. \r\n\r\n1) Limpia G. - Snack bar\r\n2) Maria F. - Clothing sales\r\n3) Norma M.

Es una peque\u00f1a comunidad rural de aproximadamente dos mil habitantes. Sus pobladores se dedican a la producci\u00f3n de leche y siembra de caf\u00e9. Tiene un relieve irregular y mucho del terreno se mantiene como bosque tropical h\u00famedo. La comunidad tiene paisajes muy pintorescos que combinan el bosque tropical con dos lindas lagunas, plantaciones de caf\u00e9 y lecher\u00edas. El Sauce se localiza aproximadamente a hora y media en bus de Turrialba, el centro de comercio m\u00e1s cercano. Sin embargo, varias veces al a\u00f1o el camino se vuelve intransitable por las lluvias que azotan la zona. Este es sin duda uno de los principales desaf\u00edos para la comunidad. \n\nCuando no exist\u00edan actividades muchas personas optaron por salir a buscar trabajos en Turrialba o en fincas bananeras ubicadas en la Zona Atl\u00e1ntica de Costa Rica. Actualmente los precios del caf\u00e9 y la leche han mejorado, por lo tanto los vecinos buscan c\u00f3mo invertir en proyectos en la misma zona y de esta forma evitar migrar.\n\nComo parte de las respuestas a esa situaci\u00f3n, desde hace dos a\u00f1os se instal\u00f3 en la comunidad una planta de elaboraci\u00f3n de quesos, propiedad de la Asociaci\u00f3n de Productores de Leche de El Sauce, hecho que motiv\u00f3 a C\u00e9sar a iniciar en la producci\u00f3n de leche para luego venderla a esta planta. \n\nC\u00e9sar desea obtener un micro cr\u00e9dito de \u00a2670,000 (seiscientos setenta mil colones) para comprar una vaca lechera y diferentes utensilios para poder iniciar con su negocio ya que quiere ser un microempresaria exitoso y  as\u00ed poder ayudar a sacar a su familia adelante, esto es una de las cosas que lo motiva a esforzarse y trabajar con mucho esmero. \n\nC\u00e9sar es socio de la Asociaci\u00f3n de Productores de El Sauce, una de las 100 organizaciones socias de EDESA en Costa Rica.

G. is a 29 year old man who lives with his parents and siblings in a community called El Sauce de Santa Teresita de Turrialba in the Cartago province.  It is a small, rural community of approximately two thousand inhabitants.  The people of El Sauce de Santa Teresita de Turrialba are involved in the production of milk and the growing of coffee.  The town is situated in hills and much of the terrain is tropical rainforest.  The community has very picturesque scenery that combines tropical forest with two pretty lagoons, coffee plantations and dairy farms.  El Sauce is located approximately one and a half hours by bus from Turrialba, the closest commercial center.  However, several times a year the road become impassible because of the rains that batter the area.  This is, without a doubt, one of the main challenges for the community.\r\n\r\nWhen there isn\u2019t much else available, many people opt to look for work in Turrialba or on banana farms located in the Atlantic zone of Costa Rica.  Currently the prices of coffee and milk have improved, so much that neighbors are looking for ways to invest in projects right in the area and in this way avoid emigrating.\r\n\r\nAs part of the solution to this situation, two years ago a cheese making plant was set up in the community. It is the property of the Association of Milk Producers of El Sauce. This motivated C\u00e9sar to start producing milk in order to sell to this plant.  \r\n\r\nC\u00e9sar  would like to obtain a loan for \u00a2670,000 (six hundred seventy thousand colones) to buy a dairy cow and other equipment in order to set up his business.   He wants to be a successful entrepreneur and be able to help his family get ahead.  This is one of the things that motivates him to put forth effort and work very hard. \r\n\r\nC\u00e9sar is a member of the Association of Producers of El Sauce, one of the one hundred organizations belonging to the micro finance association Edesa in Costa Rica. This will be his first loan and he hopes to continue growing on a personal and economic level. Thanks to this type of organization and their means for facilitating loans, he can spend more time on productive activities.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Emma Felten, Kiva

P. is a 47-year-old single mother of four children, three sons and one daughter, and lives with them in Bayanhongor, one of Mongolia's western provinces. Her only daughter goes to a secondary school. Her oldest son is 25 years old and drives a truck for a local gold-mining company. Her second son is disabled and stays home. Her youngest son is just four years old and stays home to help his disabled brother. Ulziibat has gone into business to earn money to feed her children.

is a 46-year-old woman who is married and blessed with eight children. They are living in Dalig, Antipolo City, which is in Rizal Province in the Philippines. She is a woman who has big dreams to overcome all challenges in order to achieve her goals in life. She and her husband have worked very hard to raise their big family. Despite the many hardships she encountered, she was able to send all of their eight children to school.<p>\r\nShe joined Ahon SA Hirap Inc. (ASHI), a microfinance institution and Kiva partner in the Philippines, in 2001. For almost eight years in ASHI, she has shown good performance, so she is being trusted by the institution for further loans.<p>\r\nShe runs a variety store with a little <i>carenderia<\/i> (stall selling foods ready to eat). She started her variety store based on her idea of dealing with customers. Her business is growing because the members of the community in her neighborhood like her products and find what they need in her store instead of going to other places. She is requesting a loan of 40,000 Philippine pesos as her eleventh loan from ASHI to pay for items including sacks of rice, white sugar, washed sugar, brown sugar, cigarettes, canned goods, candies, soft drinks, and cooking oil.<p>\r\nShe dreams of growing her variety store into a mini-grocery store. Her children are her motivation to continue in her business. She dreams of sending her children to school and hopes that they will complete a degree in college. Iluminada now feels very happy about her work and the service of ASHI and Kiva. Now, the couple is enjoying seeing that the loans from ASHI change their lives and give them bigger chances of making their dreams come

During her first venture in a business and all throughout the years of maintaining it since 2005, ASHI has been her great source of financial capital. Despite the struggles she faces both in matters of the business and her family, through credit from ASHI somehow her worries were always eased. Now, she is proposing a loan of Php 30,000 as her seventh loan in ASHI to pay for variety of specialty foods like coconut jam, banana chips, peanut butter, barquillos (wafers), turones (banana fritters), custard pie, pinipig (immature rice), lingua de gata (cat's tongue cookies) and other supplies.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nCurrently in Norita\u2019s growing business, she would like to request a much larger loan amount to supplement her working capital. Someday she wishes her food retail business will grow large enough to have the capacity to sell wholesale. But in the meantime, the proceeds she makes from her business are saved in preparation for the expense of educating her four children. She hopes that until their graduation from college, she will be able to give her support financially.

P. is a 41-year-old woman, and is strong and healthy. She is capable of running her own business to earn money, which she uses to support her family. Since 2006 she has been requesting loans through her membership in ASHI, KIVA's field partner in the Philippines. Those loans have made her successful with her business. Throughout her membership, she has shown a very good credit rating (the basis of a loan with ASHI) during weekly center meetings. She enjoys the solidarity of her fellow members in ASHI, as well as the input about managing a small business that she has gained from them. \r\n\r\n\r\nWith a much larger amount of business capital, in addition to the knowledge she has gained from her fellow small entrepreneurs, and with the help of her 41-year-old husband, who is a policeman and who lives with her, Analiza will be able to maximize the growth of her business. Therefore, at this time during her membership in ASHI, she is requesting a loan based on the needs of her business and her capacity to pay back. Now, on her 5th loan, she is requesting 20,000 PHP. The loan will be used to purchase fresh cucumbers and papayas, other ingredients needed for making her products, and packaging materials and other supplies. \r\n\r\n\r\nShe dreams of upgrading to a large food processing business in the future and of being able to get a stall in the market for selling her products. She hopes to see others enjoying the benefits of having loans from the ASHI-KIVA partners that will change their lives. She also wants to continue to move her business toward sustainability.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":454516,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

They live with their husband and children in large traditional families in the city of Dio\u00efla, Tripano district, prefecture of Dio\u00efla, Koulikoro region, Republic of Mali. They came to know each other through neighborhood and family connections. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group sells a diversity of products. These women have decided to work with the Soro Yiriwas microfinance institution to assure the long-term stability of their profitable business activities. This is their second group loan. The previous one was repaid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the second loan, the group plans on buying 40 liters of oil, bags of onions, five 50-kg bags of wheat flour, 10 cases of BRAMALI non-alcoholic beverages, 5 bags of sugar and a large quantity of other products. Most of the products are purchased in Bamako (capital city of the Republic of Mali). They are sold either from home or at the Dio\u00efla market to male and female customers. A monthly profit of 36 000 CFA francs per person is expected. The revenues will be used to pay the interest on the loan, provide for the needs of the family and reinvest in the business. This group hopes to diversify their business by incorporating other revenue generating activities such as the breeding of small ruminants. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Joanne Archambault, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":454585,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchase wheat flour, condiments and diverse items ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Fana KOULIKORO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.7787 -6.9564","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:58Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariam ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Matou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aminata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":300000,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-01-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-18T10:33:35Z","rounded_local_amount":51631.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118152479,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-02-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-16T08:48:29Z","rounded_local_amount":51631.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123991319,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T10:00:04Z","rounded_local_amount":51631.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129021594,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-04-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:15:13Z","rounded_local_amount":51631.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136746384,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:23Z","rounded_local_amount":51631.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144778925,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-06-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:16:33Z","rounded_local_amount":51631.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151961139,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-01-03T09:03:39Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T10:16:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":164293,"name":"Rosemary","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosemary is forty one years old.

They live in large traditional households with their husbands and children in the village of Timpana, Dio\u00efla prefecture, Koulikoro region, Republic of Mali.\r\nThey know each other through familial and community relations.\r\nThey run businesses selling various items.\r\nThese women joined the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso (one of Kiva's field partners) with the goal of making their lucrative businesses more durable. They are on their sixth solidarity (group) loan, and all the previous loans were repaid properly.\r\nWith this loan, they intend to buy 4 100-kg bags of paddy rice to be steamed before being sold, 8 bags of millet that will be turned into couscous, a large quantity of shea butter, and second-hand clothing. The majority of their products are bought in the neighbouring areas and are re-sold on-the-spot at Timpana and at the market in Dio\u00efla to a clientele composed of women and men.\r\nThey foresee realizing a monthly profit of 25,000 FCFA per person. A portion of the profits will be reinvested in their businesses, and the remainder used to pay for the daily family expenses.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Vilas Menon, Kiva

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is the second daughter in her family; she works with her parents and her older brother in the production of clothing.\r\n\r\nIt's been a short time since the death of her mother, leaving her virtually alone, and struggling with a skin disease that does not let her rest.  The older brother is married and has his family; she is still single and a short time ago set up her clothing workshop.  Among her future plans are to increase her wealth and to have a large company.  This loan will help her to buy more fabric for the production of clothing and thus produce more garments, as was the dream of her mother, especially at this time of year when the sale of garments increases considerably.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva

She lives in the Maica central area of the city of Cochabamba.  She has a business producing milk and at the same time she raises pigs.  Maria is very dedicated to her work.\r\n\r\nMaria is devoted to the education of her children because when she divorced, her husband was supposed to pay support for the education of the children but so far there has been no support.  She works from early in the morning delivering milk so that her children lack for nothing.  The children are in school and she provides for them as best she can.  Maria got married very young because she was pregnant and her parents compelled her to marry.  She had to live with her mother-in-law for some time, and help around the house with the production of milk that her mother-in-law was making.  Maria tells us that when she was pregnant with her older child she had to carry out very hard work in the country such as planting corn and milking cows two times a day, but she does not regret working with her mother-in-law because she learned a lot about farm life.\r\n\r\nMaria is requesting a loan to buy a rototiller with a trailer, or as it is commonly known, a Motocultor.

Lucienne n\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole. Pour faire face \u00e0 ses besoins, Lucienne vend des tissus et \u00e9galement de l\u2019huile de palme, par le syst\u00e8me de distribution. C\u2019est \u00e0 Dantokpa, march\u00e9 international du B\u00e9nin, que Lucienne s\u2019approvisionne. Lucienne exerce cette activit\u00e9 depuis environs 10 ans, et est \u00e0 son quatri\u00e8me cr\u00e9dit \u00e0 ALID\u00e9.

Lucienne d\u00e9sire \u00e9lever le niveau de son activit\u00e9 afin de mieux satisfaire ses clients ; mais Lucienne manque suffisamment de moyens financiers pour y arriver. C\u2019est la raison pour laquelle Lucienne sollicite un quatri\u00e8me cr\u00e9dit aupr\u00e8s de ALID\u00e9.","en":"Z. Lucienne was born around 1969 in Cotonou, the economic capital of B\u00e9nin. Lucienne has been living in Dandji in Cotonou for about 20 years. She is married to ASSOCLE Antoine, a welder, and is the mother of 4 children. Some of her children are attending school. The couple share the responsibility for supporting their family. <P>\r\n\r\nLucienne was never able to attend school. To make a living, Lucienne sells cloth as well as palm oil through the distribution system. She buys her merchandise at the international market of Benin, Dantokpa. Lucienne has been in this business for about 10 years and is on her fourth loan with ALID\u00e9. She reimbursed the three previous loans from ALID\u00e9 correctly. She would like to expand her business so that she can better satisfy her customers, but she does not have sufficient financial means to manage this. This is why Lucienne is requesting a fourth loan from ALID\u00e9.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":454695,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"purchase of lengths of cloth and jerrycans of palm oil","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Cotonou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.35 2.433333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2009-12-22T16:30:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lucienne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":400000,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.92},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.91},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.92},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.92},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.91},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.92},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.92},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.91},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.92},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.92},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.91},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":72.92,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T10:13:47Z","rounded_local_amount":33464.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118020510,"comment":null},{"amount":72.92,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T08:21:58Z","rounded_local_amount":33464.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123859003,"comment":null},{"amount":73.35,"local_amount":33533.34,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-27T23:22:13Z","rounded_local_amount":33665.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":130495131,"comment":null},{"amount":73.06,"local_amount":33400,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:41:03Z","rounded_local_amount":33531.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136619146,"comment":null},{"amount":147.44,"local_amount":67400,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:08:47Z","rounded_local_amount":67665.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151835180,"comment":null},{"amount":147.66,"local_amount":67500,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-30T08:15:03Z","rounded_local_amount":67765.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166954064,"comment":null},{"amount":73.06,"local_amount":33400,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-30T08:51:11Z","rounded_local_amount":33531.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172055730,"comment":null},{"amount":214.59,"local_amount":98100,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-03T10:26:29Z","rounded_local_amount":98486.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177347282,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-12-23T09:37:01Z","paid_date":"2010-12-03T10:26:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":164383,"name":"Elohor","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elohor, age 28, lives in Warri, Delta State, Nigeria, where she has a grocery store business, selling grocery items at retail prices to her customers.

She has been living for about ten years in the neighborhood of Dandji in Cotonou, the economic capital of Benin. She is married to Moumouni Affo and is the mother of three children. Some of her children attend school. The family lives together in Dandji. The parents provide together for their family. Adidja did not attend school, but learnt the dressmaking craft.\r\n<p>\r\nTo help her husband with the family charges, Adidja sells cloths, shoes and even jewels. She gets her supply in Dantokpa, the international market of Benin. She has been in this business for about seven years. Adidja is a long-standing client with Alid\u00e9, since she got already five loans from Alid\u00e9, which she repaid on schedule. She would like to bolster her working capital to increase her activity level and better meet the demand from her customers. This is why she came now to Alid\u00e9 and applied for her sixth loan.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Robert Mouris, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":454735,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cloth & Dressmaking Supplies","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy cloths","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Cotonou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.35 2.433333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2009-12-24T22:50:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adidja","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":300000,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2011-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T10:14:15Z","rounded_local_amount":25815.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118020513,"comment":null},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T08:21:34Z","rounded_local_amount":25815.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123859006,"comment":null},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-27T23:22:23Z","rounded_local_amount":25815.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":130495134,"comment":null},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:41:20Z","rounded_local_amount":25815.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136619149,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:08:55Z","rounded_local_amount":51631.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151835181,"comment":null},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-16T07:56:21Z","rounded_local_amount":25815.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166954066,"comment":null},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-09-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:31:05Z","rounded_local_amount":25815.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172055733,"comment":null},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T12:29:49Z","rounded_local_amount":25815.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177347285,"comment":null},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-11-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T12:28:29Z","rounded_local_amount":25815.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182482425,"comment":null},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-12-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T11:57:41Z","rounded_local_amount":25815.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188617299,"comment":null},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2011-01-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-26T09:23:46Z","rounded_local_amount":25815.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191360750,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-12-25T01:44:25Z","paid_date":"2011-02-26T09:23:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":164408,"name":"Akosua","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Akosua is 41 years old, married, and the mother of four children.
