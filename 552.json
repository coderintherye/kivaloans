He makes furniture at his own workplace, which is next to his small house, and he sells them at Narantuul, the largest outdoor market in Mongolia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She lives in the municipality Sta. Fe, Cebu. Florenia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 because she aspired for something better for her family.  With the help of her past 17 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Florenia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 29,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 12,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 18th loan, she is borrowing PHP 29,500 to buy more stock for the store so that she can continue to save up for the future expansion of her business.  Florenia is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.  \n\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Her previous loan of PHP 27,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 24,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 20th loan, she is borrowing PHP 29,500 to buy a new engine for her fishing boat so that she can continue to save up for the future expansion of her business.

lives in the municipality of Sta. Fe, in the island of Bantayan, Cebu. She earns her living by operating a shell crafting business.  Her common-law husband Andy, who is 32 years old, works as a trisikad driver to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  She has four children who are 6 months to 13 years old.  Desideria joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past seven loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Desideria has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow.

He needs capital to buy organic fertilizer since prices are low at the moment.  Juan is a humble, hardworking, and responsible individual, but it is difficult for him to access loans from banks in the city because they have too many requirements.  For this reason, he has taken the initiative to leave his district in order to apply for a loan.  \r\n<p>\r\nSr. Juan is very happy to have received this loan.

One year ago she and her husband decided to start their own business due to the scarce employment available.  They started selling food during the week at a shop and on the weekends selling animals at the cattle fair in their city.  This way they collect weekly income to use for household expenses.  Throughout this time they've learned to improve the work and offer the best to their clients.  Their plans now are to improve the shop's infrastructure and with time own their own home.  This is her 4th loan with MFP and she is happy to know she has financial backing and she promises to be punctual with payments.  She enjoys being part of her comunal bank because all of its members are responsible people and show solidarity.

In 2003 she set up her mobile disco with the help of her husband and the income from her photography business.  They began by buying a small speaker system and amplifier for small jobs such as school graduations and birthdays.  With time the business grew and the disco now has 2 disc jocky stations, 12 large speakers, a set of 8 lights that they use for events (coming-out parties, weddings, birthdays, anniversaries) in the counties and municipality of Estel\u00ed.   For now she and her husband are the only ones working in the business.\r\n\r\nShe plans to use the loan to buy a computer and printer to dowload and print photographs from digital cameras.  She'll also buy lighting and equipment to produce a smokey atmosphere for the disco.\r\n\r\nThe loan will buy the equipment necessary to provide the best attention and service to customers.  This will generate more earnings that will be put toward savings for college for her children who are now in primary school.  Delia was only able to reach her second year in secondary school.

A. is from the village of Purok Pisces Suarez, Iligan City. He is 59 years old. Nelson is married and has six adult children. \r\n\r\nTo make a living, Nelson owns and operates a business manufacturing and selling muriatic acid (a cleaning solution) products in several types of containers to local businesses and community members. Nelson has been engaged in his business for over five years and earns approximately 15,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Nelson joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve his business and living situation. Nelson has successfully repaid a previous loan of 17,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory and for working capital. \r\n\r\nNelson is requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase raw materials to manufacture additional products. This will be the sixth loan taken out by Nelson from HSPFI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand his business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is an accredited partner of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

R. is from the village of Liong, Guinsiliban, Camiguin Province. She is 57 years old. Zenaida is married and has five adult children. To make a living, Zenaida owns and operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling assorted products, such as junk foods, candies & biscuits, in the local community. Zenaida has been engaged in her business for more than 10 years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Zenaida joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Zenaida has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory & working capital. Zenaida is requesting a new loan of 6,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell, such as junk foods & candies. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Zenaida from HSPFI.

The money will be used mainly to order newspapers; part of the money will go to pay other bills. Nieva also mentioned saving up to be able to establish another personal business.

She earns her living by operating three business ventures: a sari-sari (general) store, a carenderia (a local eatery) and a livestock business. Her husband Reneboy, who is 41 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities. They have three children who are 11 to 22 years old. Two of the children work and the other one is currently going to school. Teresita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 20 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Teresita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 14,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 7,200, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 21st loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000 to fund her business operations so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children and for family needs. Teresita is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

out and making a difference is hard to do, but Rosita A., 47, is determined to do so. Rosita reached only high school and is married to Joselin, an electrician. Being a community partner of CCT, Rosita applies her learning in entrepreneurship to her business. Together, Joselin and Rosita raise their three children.\r\n\r\nRosita owns a sari-sari (variety) store located near their house. There she outshines other sari-sari stores in the vicinity by providing quality products at an affordable price. She makes sure her stock is fresh and worth every centavo of her customers\u2019 money. Monthly Rosita earns a net income of Php 3,900.\r\n\r\nStanding out requires maximum effort, and Rosita needs help to make her business stand out. She decided to borrow Php 24,000 to help her grow her business. With this she will buy more canned goods, noodles, soap, toothpaste and other household essentials. She believes that increasing the quantity of her products will affect the profitability of her store and add up to savings for her. \r\n\r\nA usual problem shared by Rosita with other sari-sari store owners is the difficulty in collecting payments from neighbors who do not pay their bills. Cash flow is very important for Rosita as the store is one main way of financing the studies of her children. That is why Rosita never gives up despite the problems and reaches for her dream of growing her store into a bigger enterprise.\r\n\r\nAs a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she receives.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay micro finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":719701,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"the

Renilda F., or Taring as she is called by her friends, makes sure she plans well so as to have a good future ahead of her. Still single at 26 years of age, Taring runs her own business as she receives continuous entrepreneurial training from CCT as a community partner. Taring finished high school and presently resides in Caloocan City.\r\n\r\nTaring owns a sari-sari (variety) store near her home. On a daily basis, she competes with other sari-sari stores in the community and makes sure her regular customers will keep buying goods from her while she continues attracting other neighbors to buy from her store. Taring has been in this business for five years now. She earns around 10,700 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nTo help her grow her business, Taring needs a loan amount of 10,000 PHP.  She will use this loan to purchase quality products which her customers are looking for. She makes sure that her store shelves will not lack any essential product which her neighbors need, and so she plans to buy more canned goods, soft drinks, and other grocery items. Taring believes that this loan will raise her sari-sari store above her competitors.\r\n\r\nCompetition is something one cannot and should not avoid. Making the most out of it, Taring is using competition to push her business to grow. This is important for her as she strives to reach her dream of having a good, well-provided for family of her own someday.\r\n\r\nAs a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she receives.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":719707,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase quality grocery items for her store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Caloocan City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-02-25T19:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Renilda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-02-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":1333.34,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:29:13Z","rounded_local_amount":1453.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195814271,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":2000.01,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:37:52Z","rounded_local_amount":2180.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201256836,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:33:55Z","rounded_local_amount":2907.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206123529,"comment":null},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":3333.35,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:49:38Z","rounded_local_amount":3634.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211194837,"comment":null},{"amount":16.67,"local_amount":666.62,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:43:13Z","rounded_local_amount":726.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216473992,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-02-25T21:55:02Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T10:43:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":276870,"name":"Nga's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This village bank loan consists of sixteen members located in Kandal Kaoh Touch village in Kandal province.

Yvonne, as she is called by her friends, is a college graduate.  At 38, she runs her own business, serves her husband Edgardo who works abroad, and mothers two children who both study in elementary school.\r\n\r\nMarivonne is in the business of buying and selling merchandise. What she sells often is food, which is a basic need of people everywhere. She looks for the kind of food that is a daily essential and that which suits the tastes of her customers. With this entrepreneurial effort she earns a net income of 9,800 PHP.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operation of her business, Marivonne would like to request a loan of 14,000 PHP. With the loan and the learning she receives from CCT as a community partner, she will grow her business. She will purchase frozen food, cookies, and some canned goods, and strategize on how to get as many satisfied customers as she can.\r\n\r\nAt present, Marivonne deals with the problem of collecting payments from her customers. Nevertheless, she believes that good relational skills will enable her to solve this issue with her business connections. She continually holds on to the strength and favor God gives her to make her life better, such as having an expanding business with its own official commercial space. A sweeter success that she aims for is to make their living sustainable enough that her husband would not have to work abroad. Then, her desire of a family that stays together will be fulfilled. \r\n\r\nAs a CCT community partner, Marivonne faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she receives.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":719719,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase

feels good to exceed other people\u2019s expectations. But more than doing it for the goal of feeling good, Restituto R., 27, does it for his family\u2019s future. \r\n\r\nRestituto has been educated to high school level and is married to Mechelle, who is a devoted housewife and mother to their children, who now study in school. The family resides in Binondo, Manila.\r\n\r\nRestituto runs a sari-sari (general) store with the help of his wife. Aside from common products such as canned goods and instant noodles, he also sells ice, which is sought after in the hot weather. Mineral water is also part of the list of items for sale. The store is relatively easy to manage because Restituto and his family also live there. Monthly, he earns around Php12,000.\r\n\r\nTo help him grow his business, Restituto decided to borrow Php14,000. He will use this to buy more products to fill his shelves. He will boost his selling of ice and water as the summer is fast approaching. With this loan he believes he can be more profitable and earn additional money to save and use for future opportunities.\r\n\r\nRestituto lacks the capital for expansion. He believes that this is a great challenge, as many other sari-sari stores in the vicinity are also competing for more regular customers. Restituto wants to make sure his regular customers will remain loyal and also wants to reach out to more potential customers. He wants to change the expectation that sari-sari stores are meant to stay small, because being able to expand his business will enable him to provide quality education for his children. At the end of the day, it will still be for his family.\r\n\r\nAs a CCT community partner, he faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship* meeting where he can also draw strength and inspiration from the word of god he receives.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the word of god, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":719779,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"Restocking inventory.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Binondo, Manila","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-02-25T16:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Restituto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-02-02T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":14000,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2011-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2011-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2011-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":933.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.66},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.66},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.66},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.66},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.66},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":86.67,"local_amount":3733.32,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:29:21Z","rounded_local_amount":3780.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195814273,"comment":null},{"amount":86.66,"local_amount":3733.32,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:38:01Z","rounded_local_amount":3780.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201256838,"comment":null},{"amount":86.67,"local_amount":3733.32,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:33:39Z","rounded_local_amount":3780.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206123531,"comment":null},{"amount":65,"local_amount":2800.04,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:49:46Z","rounded_local_amount":2835.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211194841,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-02-26T00:35:58Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T10:49:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":276887,"name":"Gemma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gemma S. is from the village of Baikingon, Cagayan de Oro City.

They have four children who are 2 to 9 years old. Amelita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2001 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 16 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Amelita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 12,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 9,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 17th loan, she is borrowing PHP 14,000 to purchase more stock to sell so that she can continue to save up for future house improvements.  Amelita is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

They have two children who are 34 and 35 years old and already have their own families. Caridad joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2003 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 14 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Caridad has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 16,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 15th loan, she is borrowing PHP 20,000 to buy charcoal to resell so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her grandchildren. Caridad is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

is a married woman who lives in Manapla, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating a general store. Her husband Ernesto, who is 52 years old, works as an Inkarkado\/supervisor to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities. They have eight children who are 12 to 29 years old. Two of the children have their own families, three of them work to help her and two are currently going to school. Arcenia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past six loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Arcenia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her seventh loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000 to purchase more stock to sell so that she can continue to save up for the future for her family and for educational needs. Arcenia is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

is a married woman who lives in Toledo City, Cebu. She earns her living by operating a food production sales business.  Her husband Sabas, who is 54 years old, works as a driver to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have four children who are 21 to 27 years old.  Amparo joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2009 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past three loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Amparo has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 9,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 3,200, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her fourth loan, she is borrowing PHP 11,000 to buy ingredients for her food vending business so that she can continue to save up for future business expansion and to earn more income.  Amparo is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

They have a child who is six years old. Glory Jean joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2009 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Glory Jean has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 20,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her fifth loan, she is borrowing PHP 29,500 to fund her business operations so that she can continue to save up for future house improvement. Glory Jean is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

She earns her living by operating a general store, a pig fattening business and an e-loading business. Her husband Rey, who is 33 years old, works as a security guard to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities. Fe joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2010 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past two loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Fe has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 7,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 9,800, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her third loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000 to buy more stock for resale so that she can continue to save up for future business improvement and home repairs. Fe is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

Her husband Richard, who is 40 years old, works as a vendor to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities. They have three children who are 13 to 18 years old.  Chayrell joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1999 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 18 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Chayrell has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 5,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 19th loan, she is borrowing PHP 12,000 to use as additional working capital so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children.  Chayrell is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

This time, for her eighth loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000 to fund her vegetable farming business so that she can continue to save up for future house repair and house improvement.

She is doing all she can to achieve just that. One effort to reach this goal is to have a means of sustainability. Thus, Lourdes joined CCT* as a community partner, and, with the entrepreneurial learning she gains there, she is able to run her own small business. Lourdes is married to Rolando, who is a water tender. They have a child who is now in high school.\r\n\r\nLourdes directly sells beauty products, such as local brands M.S.E., Natasha, and Board Walk,  and other accessories to friends, neighbors, and business connections. She also sells silver jewelry chosen for her clients' tastes. Rolando, on the other hand, makes money by delivering gallons of water to the homes of fellow community members with the use of his side car. Their monthly family income reaches around Php10,000.\r\n\r\nTo help grow her business, Lourdes decided to ask for a Php14,000 loan. She intends to use this loan money to purchase her own stock of products, accessories, and jewelry items for sale. She needs enough money on hand to buy her customers' orders even before their initial payments. The loan money, Lourdes says, increases her capacity to earn and helps to augment the needs of her family.\r\n\r\nOne major problem she faces is the fact that some customers do not pay on time. Lourdes takes the responsibility of paying for the sold item. But Lourdes is willing and ready to face whatever challenge lies ahead, just for their lives to be sustained and be in order. She commits herself to financing the studies of her child until she sees this child graduate from college.

This is what Edielyn T., 20, experiences both in her personal life and in her business. Edielyn did not reach college. At present, she is a community partner with CCT*, a wife to 20-year old, Johnny, who works as a pedicab driver, and a young mother to two little children. Their family lives in Baseco, Manila.\r\n\r\nEdielyn cooks and sells jampong for the neighborhood. This gives her a source of income, along with her sari-sari (variety) store, where she hangs packets of shampoo and toothpaste, and stores candies and biscuits in transparent containers for the customers to see. The store is an extension of their home, so Edielyn can manage it while taking care of her kids. Edielyn has been in this business for two years.  Monthly, she earns Php20, 000 on average.\r\n\r\nKnowing that she needs financial aid to help her grow her business, she decided to  borrow Php10, 000. She will use this to buy ingredients for making jampong and for buying grocery items for her store. She can see that more products on display will encourage customers to buy at her store. The loan, she affirms, is a big help, not only to her business but also to her growing family.\r\n\r\nHer challenges include having customers who do not regularly pay their debts.  As a young wife and mom, it is hard to manage both home and business. But she is determined not to give up, knowing that she is responsible for not just her own life, but for the life of her family.\r\n\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":719868,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"Restocking inventory","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Baseco, Manila","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-02-25T17:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edielyn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-02-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:37:46Z","rounded_local_amount":2913.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201256841,"comment":null},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:33:49Z","rounded_local_amount":2913.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206123534,"comment":null},{"amount":83.34,"local_amount":3333.35,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:49:32Z","rounded_local_amount":3641.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211194846,"comment":null},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":1333.29,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:43:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1456.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216473995,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-02-25T21:36:57Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T10:43:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":276936,"name":"Um","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Um S. is a 49 year-old man who lives in the province of Kompong Tom.

By working hard in her buy and sell fashion accessories business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 15,000. Teresa is borrowing PHP 12,000 to purchase more stock to sell.   This will be her 15th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 12,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom.

N., 32, knows that little beginnings can lead to great things. He reached only high school, but now he is running his own business and aspiring to more. The lessons of entrepreneurship and weekly Bible fellowships in CCT* enabled him to reach this point in his life. He is husband to Rosalinda, a water tender, and father to four children who are now in school. Their family currently resides in Baseco, Manila.\r\n\r\nAntonio\u2019s primary business is operating a pedicab ( a bicycle with sidecar used for public transportation).  He also sees opportunities in selling biscuits and water. Though small, his business has good potential for growth. He buys biscuits in bulk and sells them to neighbors and friends. He also uses his side car to deliver gallons of water to members of the community. His business has been going on for five years . Antonio works hard to offer only the best service to his customers.\r\n\r\nTo further help him grow his small businesses, Antonio is asking for a loan of Php14, 000. He plans to use this to purchase more items for repacking and selling. Part of the money will also go to the maintenance of his side car.  \r\n\r\nUnpaid debts of customers contribute to his worries. Nevertheless, he believes that God is the solution to all these problems, and that his faith will see him through. He prays that his business will prosper and his children will all finish their studies as they grow up to become good, responsible citizens. \r\n\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":719833,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","use":"Maintenance of sidecar units and additional stock to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Baseco, Manila","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-02-25T18:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Antonio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":14000,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2011-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2011-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":933.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.66},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.66},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.66},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.66},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.66},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":65,"local_amount":2799.99,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:29:08Z","rounded_local_amount":2840.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195814276,"comment":null},{"amount":86.67,"local_amount":3733.32,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:37:50Z","rounded_local_amount":3786.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201256842,"comment":null},{"amount":86.66,"local_amount":3733.32,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:33:53Z","rounded_local_amount":3786.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206123535,"comment":null},{"amount":86.67,"local_amount":3733.37,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:49:35Z","rounded_local_amount":3786.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211194848,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-02-25T22:10:33Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T10:49:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":276940,"name":"Esterlina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Esterlina V. is from the village of Tagpako, Gingoog City.

She reached college and uses all she learned from there and from the entrepreneurial training she receives as a community partner in CCT* to boost her business. She is married to Roy, the driver of a delivery truck. They have two children, who are both in elementary school. Their family came from the province of Bohol and now resides in Baseco, Manila.\r\n\r\nLast year, Remelina saw a good business opportunity buying and selling ready-to-wear clothes. She then pushed through with this venture until today. Mainly, Remelina\u2019s business is rug-making. She uses cheap raw materials to come up with nice rugs for sale. Aside from that, she also sells electronic load for mobile phones which is much in demand nowadays. With all these businesses Remelina earns around Php 10,000 per month.\r\n\r\nKnowing that she\u2019ll be needing more finances to help her grow her business, Remelina applies for a Php 21,000 loan. She will use this money to purchase raw materials necessary for rug-making. Also, part of the loan will go to the improvement of the family comfort room.\r\n\r\nFinancial needs such as medication for her ailing mother bother Remelina. But despite these struggles she knows she has to continue the operation of her business, since this will be one way which God will use to give them financial provision. Remelina is hopeful, knowing that soon she will be able to relocate the site of her store. More than anything, she desires to see her family grow closer to God and have a good life. She yearns to see her children surpass her and graduate from college.\r\n\r\nAs a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she received.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":719830,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","use":"raw

is a 43-year-old married woman who supports her family by operating food production and cake making businesses.  She lives in Toledo City, Cebu. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2002 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her food production and cake making businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 9,000. Susan is borrowing PHP 15,000 to purchase more stock for her business. This will be her 16th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Susan aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Zenaida Requentosa, 47, is one kind of a typical mother. She was not able to go to high school, but because she is a community partner in CCT*, she receives entrepreneurial training and biblical encouragement to help her start and run her own business. Zeny, as she is called by friends, is the wife of Rodrigo, a mason, and the loving mother of three children who are all in high school.  They live in Baseco, Manila.\r\n\r\nZeny runs a business in which balut (fertilized duck egg with an undeveloped embryo) is made and sold to the community. Balut is a common food in the country and is often sought after at night. Zeny capitalizes on this big market and produces quality balut. She also adds fish and pork crackers, which are the best accompaniment for balut. Zeny has been in this business for seven years  and earns around Php12,000 every month.\r\n\r\nTo help her grow her business, Zenaida seeks a Php17, 000 loan. She intends to use this to improve her balut-making business\u2014buying quality ingredients, paying hired men, and other business expenses. She is sure that the loan will increase the profitability of her business and will help finance the schooling of her three children.\r\n\r\nZenaida worries about the financial stability of her family.  There are times when the balut sales are low, and some customers who borrow do not pay. Nevertheless, she does not give up hoping and believing that her business will grow, and that it will be God\u2019s way of blessing her family with a life of peace and good health.\r\n\r\nAs a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she received.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":719935,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Balut-Making","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase more raw balut eggs for selling ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Baseco, Manila","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-02-25T20:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zenaida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-02-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":17000,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1133.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1133.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1133.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1133.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1133.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1133.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1133.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1133.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1133.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1133.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1133.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1133.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":1133.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1133.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1133.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.66},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.66},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.66},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.66},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.66},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":106.67,"local_amount":4533.32,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:37:49Z","rounded_local_amount":4660.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201256848,"comment":null},{"amount":106.66,"local_amount":4533.32,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:33:51Z","rounded_local_amount":4660.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206123541,"comment":null},{"amount":133.34,"local_amount":5666.65,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:49:34Z","rounded_local_amount":5825.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211194862,"comment":null},{"amount":53.33,"local_amount":2266.71,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:43:18Z","rounded_local_amount":2330.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216474000,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-02-25T22:55:46Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T10:43:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":276965,"name":"34 Thi Tran Van Ha - Thieu Hoa Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"\"Huong N.

Matilde is responsible for supporting the children and paying the family's other expenses because her husband abandoned the family several years ago.  She is an amazing mother who has managed to raise her children while working hard to support them.  Matilde operates a business selling fresh vegetables and grains, along with other produce.  She buys the products herself from a farm in the country and brings them to her town for sale.  She is applying for a loan so that she can buy potatoes, cheese, beans and meat that she will resell.  Matilde would like to open a store in her house one day, a step that would ensure her future.  There are 9 members of the community bank in the photograph, one of whom brought her little daughter.  Sr. V. P. Edgardo Humberto wasn't able to attend the session, taken when she funds were distributed, because he had to work."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1750,"image":{"id":720075,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Buy merchandise to

At first she sold cosmetics and accessories, but as she accumulated a little bit of capital, she began offering clothes for women, children, and men.

With two sources of household income, she is able to provide for her three children, who range in age from 3 to 20, and give them a quality education so that they will have a successful future.  Zobeida has not abandoned her goal of organizing her business.  Her focus is on opening a store in another location because she currently operates her business out of her home.  By having a separate location, she will be able to maintain the family peace at home, so she is working hard to achieve this objective.
