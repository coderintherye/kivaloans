is from the village of Bungad in San Pablo, Isabela. She is 44 years old. Josephine is married and has six school-aged children. To make a living, Josephine started her retailing business of clothes, slippers, and shoes in the local community. \n\nIn 2007, Josephine joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Josephine has successfully repaid a previous loan of 20,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. Josephine is requesting a new loan of 23,000 PHP to purchase new items to expand product offering. This will be Josephine's third loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's living conditions. \n\nAbout ASKI:\n\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

They are diverse like people themselves. Different people have different ordeals. It is believed that strong people have more difficult ordeals. However, steadfastness and hope for better always help people to live through them. Besides, there are always people around us who are there to support us in difficult moments. Those are our parents, closest relatives and friends. \r\n\r\nThe leader of this group, Nazgul, a 28-year-old young woman, deserves to be called a strong woman. The ordeal that awaited her was divorce after a few years of happy marriage. The expectations of cozy and agreeable married life did not come true. Instead, after divorce actually took place, she was left with two children to raise and uncertainty about life in the future.  Nazgul wisely viewed things in a sensible light. She talked to her parents and they agreed to help her look after her five\u2013year-old son and three\u2013year-old daughter while Nazgul is at work as a hospital nurse.  Her parents have also given her some sheep for breeding and so animal husbandry became Nazgul\u2019s second occupation. Although she only earns about $95 per month, she can always sell some of her cattle to satisfy her family's needs.  Nazgul wants to increase the total population of her cattle and is therefore requesting a loan to buy a calf. <p>\r\n\r\nThere are three partners in Nazgul\u2019s group:<p>\r\n\r\nAsigul, 60, has raised four children and is married to a vice principal of music college. Asigul is a housewife who keeps some cattle and needs a loan to buy a cow.<p>\r\n\r\nBurulbu, 59, has one son, a boxing trainer. and a retired husband.  For a living, Burulbu raises livestock and sells milk. She hopes to obtain a loan to buy a cow. <p>\r\n\r\nKuljamal, 56, a mother of five children, is married to a shepherd. Kuljamal stays at home and looks after cattle and sells milk. She has applied for this loan to buy a milk cow. <p>\r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

Ainake lives in the city of Karbalta, sixty kilometers from the capital. A fifty-eight-year-old widow Ainake has earned the right to consider herself a strong and courageous woman, because she has raised seven children: six daughters and one son. The eldest daughter is now thirty-eight, the youngest is twenty-two. After her husband passed away Ainake courageously continued raising her children by herself. Fortunately today all the daughters and the only son are married. \r\n\r\nAfter the death of his father Ainake's son decided to stay and help her run the household. From her husband Ainake inherited a few animals. After discussing it with her children and relatives Ainake decided to keep the livestock rather than sell it. She had to learn how to tend for the animals. She was very fortunate that her son was right there, helping her along the way. Time itself has shown just how wise her decision was. She was able to increase the headcount of her livestock and when the time came for her children to be married this livestock came very handy. Ainake saved a lot of money since she didn't have to purchase meat.\r\n\r\nCurrently Ainake sells milk and that's how she earns income for her living expenses. Whenever she needs a larger amount her son sells some of the livestock on the local market. Ainake is hoping to purchase an additional cow to increase the profits from the sale of milk. She is planning to do renovations in her house and also replace the gates.\r\n<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAinake has three partners in her group:\r\n\r\nEldiar T. is thirty-seven. He has two children. His wife stays at home with the children. To feed his family Eldiar raises sheep and sells milk. He needs the loan in order to buy one more cow. He has a dream to build a house on his farm.\r\n\r\nGulzat D. is thirty-four. Her husband is an electrician. They have three children. The youngest daughter is only four. All children go to primary school. Gulzat stays at home tending the livestock. She is asking for a loan in order to purchase a cow.\r\n\r\nAinura O. is forty-nine. With her husband Ainura raised four children: three daughters and one son. All the daughters are married. The son attends school, he is only eleven. Ainura's husband works as a manager of a farm. At home Ainura tends her livestock as well as knits and sells local souvenirs. Ainura is hoping to get a loan in order to buy a cow.\r\n<\/p>\r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

Pascual Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Teresita C. P. is from the village of Mocag Baggao, Cagayan. She is 55 years old. Teresita is the group leader of an 11 member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nTeresita is married and has 4 adult children. To make a living, Teresita owns & operates a business raising livestock. The main source of income for the business comes from raising pigs for sale. Teresita has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 1,500 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Teresita joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Teresita is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase livestock feed & other supplies. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Teresita from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n\r\n<b>About ASKI:<\/b>\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n<font size=\"1\"> <b>*Note:<\/b> To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

J. is 33 years old and lives with his wife and two sons in Uvurkhangai province in central Mongolia. He and his family live together in a traditional Mongolian housing tent called a \"ger\". His oldest son is 17 years old and attends a local secondary school and his youngest will soon start kindergarten. Sodnom operates a transportation service and flour and rice trading business in his town. He transports people and goods from his province to Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia's capital city. In Ulaanbaatar, he purchases rice and flour which he transports back to his province to sell. His wife assists in the business and sells the products when her husband is traveling. Sodnom started his business in 2008 and has made much progress in his first year of operation. He has many plans for the future and says, \"With stable business operations, my wife and I are planning to expand our flour and rice trading business and hope to begin selling a wide variety of grocery products\". Sodnom is requesting a 3,500,000 tugrug (~2,500 USD) loan to purchase flour and rice to sell in his business.\r\n\r\nAbout XacBank:\r\n\r\nXacBank was founded in 2001, and listed its first loan on Kiva in January 2009. It is the largest microfinance organization in Mongolia, but also has mainstream commercial operations. XacBank has the vision, scale and innovation to develop and implement new solutions to poverty. It is currently utilizing Kiva\u2019s 0% lending interest rate to return 9% of interest paid from borrowers to them in the form of a savings account at the end of their loans.

O. is 27 years old and lives with her husband and two sons in Uvurkhangai province in central Mongolia. She and her family live in a ger, which is a traditional Mongolian housing tent. Her oldest son, Bilguunsaikhan, is seven years old and attends a local secondary school. Her youngest, Turbold, has not yet reached school age. Surmaahorloo operates a dairy product selling business in her town. She started her business in 2000 by renting a stall at the local market to sell her products. After years of successful business operations, she used her savings to build a small shop in 2007. Having her own shop has been very positive for her business and she has built a great reputation among her many customers. Surmaahorloo attributes her success to her good accounting skills. She has many plans for the future and says, \"I want to expand my business and build an addition on to my shop.\" She is requesting a 1,500,000 tugrug (~1,050 USD) loan to purchase dairy products to sell in her business. \r\n\r\nAbout XacBank:\r\n\r\nXacBank was founded in 2001, and listed its first loan on Kiva in January 2009.

Evangeline is requesting a new loan of 12,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Evangeline from ASKI.

After the collapse of the Soviet Union, most of the industrial factories stopped working, and there was little opportunity to work for the government. Alert people switched to commerce. They started to trade in various goods or opened their own businesses. Lots of people have gone abroad in search of work. Iqbol has been lucky, since she and her husband stayed in the city. They have been able to make their living in Kant. \r\n<p>\r\nHer husband is a builder. They are raising five children. The eldest daughter is thirteen, and the smallest son is just a year and half. Iqbol inherited a trade from her parents, making flat cakes. She invested $23 and started selling flat cakes at home. It has been six years since she started, and now she has a net profit of $95 a month. \r\n<p>\r\nIqbol\u2019s elder daughter helps her look after the little kids and also helps her knead dough. Her husband helps her buy and transport flour. Sometimes her children stay outside with Iqbol and help her sell the flat cakes. \r\n<p>\r\nCurrently, Iqbol needs a loan to purchase three sacks of flour, salt and yeast for baking flat cakes. She has big plans for expanding her business and helping her children get an education and get on their feet. \r\n\r\nIqbol\u2019s group partners: \r\n\r\nZebiniso, 38, is a builder\u2019s wife. She has six children. Zebiniso and her husband have recently collected beet crops. They also keep hens and sell eggs. They need a loan to buy a cow, so that they do not have to buy milk for their children. \r\n\r\nMukimjon, 48, trades in vegetables: potatoes, beets and radishes. He has three children. Mukimjon hopes to provide them with a good education and wants his daughters to marry. Mukimjon needs a loan to invest in purchasing vegetables wholesale. \r\n\r\nSalomat, 43, has four children. Her husband works as a builder. Salomat bakes and sells flat cakes. She hopes to obtain a loan to buy several sacks of flour. \r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of the 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

Her husband works as steam engine fireman at a school. During many years Synzhibek together with her husband have been saving money so they could buy some kind of livestock. Finally, their labor efforts have been successful and they have bought their first cow. Because Synzhibek's husband is always at the school and main responsibilities for taking care of the cow have been placed on Synzhibek's shoulders. She got used to the new business quickly and soon started to show interest in getting a calf. She has concluded that in today's circumstances animal husbandry is a profitable business. Her husband helped with the new investment and they also started to get additional income from milk sales. It has been fifteen years as Synzhibek and her husband have been doing animal husbandry. They buy calves, feed them for one year and then resell. Right now Synzhibek enjoys doing her business. During these fifteen years animal husbandry has been a source of meat, milk and a substantial income from the sales of cattle and meat. Synzhibek and her husband were able to build a house. Just the milk sales alone bring them 2,400 somoni a month. Synzhibek has bought her first cow for only 2,000 somoni. Right now she is planning to buy a calf for feeding and resale, but she does not have the finances to realize her purchase. This is why she has asked for a loan. \r\n\r\nSynzhibek has three group partners:\r\n\r\nErkingul O. is thirty three years old. She is a mother of two children. Erkingul's husband works in construction. Erkingul breeds the cattle herself and also resells it as well as sells the milk. Erkingul needs a loan to buy a calf.\r\n\r\nSaltanat D. is forty eight years old. She has three children. Saltanat's husband is a medical worker in a hospital. Saltanat keeps the cattle at home and sells the milk. She hopes to buy a calf and she needs a loan for this.\r\n\r\nAnara S. is fifty years old. Anara has two children. They are both grown ups: her daughter is married and lives with her family. Her son lives with the parents. Anara's husband does miscellaneous work in construction. Anara transports freights. She wants to get a loan to buy a cow.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Elena Fedorchuk, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":437850,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy a calves for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Karabalta","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":135,"posted_date":"2009-12-01T23:50:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":925,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Synzhibek","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Erkingul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Saltanat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":40000,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":3127},{"due_date":"2010-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":3406},{"due_date":"2010-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":3568},{"due_date":"2010-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":3689},{"due_date":"2010-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3828},{"due_date":"2010-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4059},{"due_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":4229},{"due_date":"2010-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4490},{"due_date":"2010-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4688},{"due_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4916}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.31},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.77},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.51},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.3},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.53},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.86},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.8},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.83},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.41},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.68}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":72.31,"local_amount":3127,"processed_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:17:03Z","rounded_local_amount":3167.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110730799,"comment":null},{"amount":78.77,"local_amount":3406,"processed_date":"2010-01-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:08:47Z","rounded_local_amount":3450.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118121346,"comment":null},{"amount":82.51,"local_amount":3568,"processed_date":"2010-02-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:46:56Z","rounded_local_amount":3614.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123956998,"comment":null},{"amount":85.3,"local_amount":3689,"processed_date":"2010-03-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-21T07:41:50Z","rounded_local_amount":3737.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128989807,"comment":null},{"amount":88.53,"local_amount":3828,"processed_date":"2010-04-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:35:53Z","rounded_local_amount":3878.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136715616,"comment":null},{"amount":93.86,"local_amount":4059,"processed_date":"2010-05-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-11T07:45:23Z","rounded_local_amount":4112.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144748472,"comment":null},{"amount":97.8,"local_amount":4229,"processed_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-11T07:45:46Z","rounded_local_amount":4284.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151931446,"comment":null},{"amount":103.83,"local_amount":4490,"processed_date":"2010-07-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:35:15Z","rounded_local_amount":4548.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159670472,"comment":null},{"amount":108.41,"local_amount":4688,"processed_date":"2010-08-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:38:11Z","rounded_local_amount":4749.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166884152,"comment":null},{"amount":113.68,"local_amount":4916,"processed_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:23:56Z","rounded_local_amount":4980.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172151308,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-12-07T15:48:02Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:23:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":157982,"name":"Chizoba","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Chizoba has a salon where she makes lovely hair styles for her customers, and she also sells hair extensions and creams.

However, studying was difficult due to her economic situation and the best she could achieve was a promotion at her job. \r\n<p>\r\nMarithza is 26 years old and lives in neighborhood 380 with her husband and one-year-old son. Their house is livable, but lacks plaster, and interior walls for privacy. The floor is dirt and they would like to cover it with tiles for the hygiene of the baby.\r\n<p>\r\nHer goal is to continue her studies to be able to choose a better job with better pay. With this loan, she will build a porch that will begin as a corridor and be finished little by little. The loan will pay for construction materials like stone, sand and cement. Marithza is happy to be able to make her house prettier each time with the help of this financing.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by jeffrey hersk, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":438022,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"Stone, cement, sand, steel, and roofing for corridor to be finished later","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2009-11-30T17:40:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marithza Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":6000,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":666.64}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":34.93,"local_amount":698.54,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T10:58:54Z","rounded_local_amount":724.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110601896,"comment":null},{"amount":33.23,"local_amount":664.68,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T07:53:01Z","rounded_local_amount":689.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123841446,"comment":null},{"amount":33.77,"local_amount":675.38,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T07:50:20Z","rounded_local_amount":700.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128874364,"comment":null},{"amount":32.93,"local_amount":658.62,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:30:33Z","rounded_local_amount":683.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136604251,"comment":null},{"amount":33.77,"local_amount":675.44,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:30:37Z","rounded_local_amount":700.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144639715,"comment":null},{"amount":32.62,"local_amount":652.5,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:00:15Z","rounded_local_amount":676.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151821495,"comment":null},{"amount":32.08,"local_amount":641.53,"processed_date":"2010-07-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:02:46Z","rounded_local_amount":665.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159561502,"comment":null},{"amount":33.34,"local_amount":666.67,"processed_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:17:06Z","rounded_local_amount":691.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166770449,"comment":null},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":666.64,"processed_date":"2010-09-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T07:45:30Z","rounded_local_amount":691.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172204346,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-11-30T20:08:03Z","paid_date":"2010-10-16T07:45:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":158042,"name":"Feyisara","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Feyisara is 54 years old and married with four children.

a seventeen-year career in industrial manufacturing, Moe wanted to change the course of his life by becoming his own boss and controlling his own destiny. He considered opening his own convenience store, running a gas station, and possibly opening a restaurant. Ultimately, he found a new career that finally put his computer and graphic design skills to use.\r\n \r\nIn 2006 Moe became the new owner of Stop Signs, Inc. \u201cI make signs that go on buildings, road signs, and real estate signs. We do all kind of signs \u2013 illuminated and non-illuminated, including exterior channel letters. We cover the whole sign-making process from \u201cconcept to design to manufacturing.\u201d\r\n \r\nBusiness has been growing for Moe since 2006, but in the past year revenue has stabilized. \u201cWe\u2019re not growing like we used to. But we\u2019re surviving \u2013 we\u2019re keeping our heads above water!\u201d says Moe.\r\n \r\nBut this past summer, Moe\u2019s most expensive piece of equipment \u2013 the lift truck he uses to install large outdoor signs on the sides of buildings \u2013 broke down. Moe went to his local bank for a loan and was turned down, but they referred him to Opportunity Fund, his local microfinance institution. A $10,000 loan will allow Moe to buy a new lift truck so that he can install his signs more quickly and more safely.\r\n \r\nMoe\u2019s dreams for his business are to continue serving his local community with quality designed signs and eventually to franchise Stop Signs, Inc. across the nation. \u201cI am proud that I learned this business and became a master sign maker. It\u2019s so different from what I used to do. But I\u2019m great at it. We can handle any job and I am proud of the risk I took to pursue my dream to be my own boss!\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":10000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":7321.87,"image":{"id":438060,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"To

S.\r\n\r\nI have three minor children.  When I was ten, I sold fruit with my mother from a stand that she bought.  In time, she gave me her business so that I could generate my own income.  That is how I only had to bring the merchandise from the fruit market (avocado, apple, passion fruit, eggfruit, and bananas) and sometimes fruits from our farm.  I also worked cleaning houses.  I had to stop selling in my business because I needed to take care of my last baby.\r\n\r\nAfter four months I decided to set up a space in my house to sell groceries.  I used the money that I had saved to do so.  Initially my merchandise was \u00bc dozen detergents, \u00bd dozen oils, 2 dozen milk, \u00bd dozen tuna, 1 dozen soft drinks, \u00bc dozen salt, and a sack of sugar.  My husband did not like the idea because he wanted a larger business with greater income.  Now he is the one who drives me to get ahead.  I know that with my effort I will make my store grow.  The earnings that I get I use to better set up my store.  \r\n\r\nI need the loan to buy fruit, diapers, toilet paper, rice, sugar, and milk.  In the future, this will support my children\u2019s education.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

V. Ketti Milagritos\r\n\r\nFor three years I have worked as a small businesswoman making all types of knitting by hand and by machine.  I took some short courses like computer science, sewing and cutting, and weaving at a CEO (Occupational Education Center).  \r\n\r\nAfter separating from my life partner I had to face the expenses alone for my seven year old son, my mother, and myself.  It was indispensable to have a knitting machine, but I did not have the money to get one.  When my brother-in-law saw the effort that I put into the work I made in the shop where I studied, he gave me the tool (knitting machine) to undertake this business.  That is how I started making baby clothes, quilts, layettes, and hats.  I offered them to my friends, they liked my work, and later they ordered more.  \r\n\r\nKnitting is a distraction because I do it on the week ends.  Also, it gives me time to work in my sister\u2019s bookstore.  The earnings from these sales allow me to pay for food, education, and the basic service expenses of my home.  I was also able to get a blender and television.\r\n\r\nI need the loan to buy cones of various colors of thread, buttons, elastic, colored ribbons, and some replacement parts for my machine.  I will sell the items during this Christmas season when there is more demand.       \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":438088,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Buy materials for knitting with wool and thread","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2009-12-01T07:10:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ketti Milagritos","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":83.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25.86,"local_amount":73.89,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T12:46:47Z","rounded_local_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110669121,"comment":null},{"amount":32.59,"local_amount":93.11,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:15:30Z","rounded_local_amount":94.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118064583,"comment":null},{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":82.99,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:46:32Z","rounded_local_amount":84.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123899643,"comment":null},{"amount":29.4,"local_amount":84.01,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:44:58Z","rounded_local_amount":85.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128933726,"comment":null},{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:07:59Z","rounded_local_amount":84.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136661326,"comment":null},{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:06:18Z","rounded_local_amount":84.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144694020,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-12-01T11:10:56Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T09:06:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":158068,"name":"Juntos Progresamos Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"SONIA, TIENE  48 A\u00d1OS D.

Actualmente tengo mi propio carrito que lo obtuve de los pr\u00e9stamos que me hice, compr\u00e9 mercader\u00eda de insumos para este negocio, tasas, platos. Recientemente acondicion\u00e9 un espacio de mi casa para colocar una mesita e instal\u00e9 una puerta enrolladora. Quiero comprar dos mesitas con sus sillas que me hacen falta; por ello requiero del pr\u00e9stamo adem\u00e1s de surtirlo con bebidas e insumos (platos y cubiertos descartables, panes, cremas, hamburguesas, lechuga, pollo) Utilizo la ganancia en apoyar a mi hijo en sus estudios ya que muy pronto egresar\u00e1 y necesitar\u00e1 de un capital para obtener el t\u00edtulo en mec\u00e1nica automotriz; del mismo modo me responsabilizo con algunos servicios b\u00e1sicos y alimentaci\u00f3n.\n","en":"JULIA LILIANA\r\n\r\nI am a married mother of two. I am 42 years old. For three years I have worked as a small businesswoman. I began out of necessity--to help my husband with household costs. Before having my business selling food to-go I had to work selling bread and cookies every weekend in the hill towns. I took advantage of my trips by bringing their orders of cheese and potatoes. Likewise, I sold chicken soup en the Chosica market, and the profit made went to household costs. I later left the job because it didn't give me enough time to take care of my children.\r\n\r\nLater I took advantage of selling hamburgers outside my home with the sandwich cart my sister lent me. To tell the truth, I didn't sell all the plates of chicken wigs and hamburgers I made in the beginning. What was left over we had to eat. I didn't stop selling because I knew with patience and perseverance that it would start to get better. With time, my number of customers grew.\r\n\r\nRecently, I fixed up a space in my house to put a little table. I installed a rolling door. I want to buy two more little tables and chairs. To buy them, I need a loan. I will also use the loan to stock up on drinks and other supplies (disposable plates and silverware, bread, sauces, hamburgers, lettuce, chicken). I will use the profits to support my son in his studies.  He is graduating high school very soon and will need the money to get a degree in automobile mechanics. At the same time, I am responsible for basic services and foods.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lydia Brantley, Kiva

This group consists of eleven members from the Caribbean coast of Costa Rica in the Cariari region. With this loan, each member will receive a deposit to invest at their discretion. These women have created The Women\u2019s Bank of Little Ants as a formal way to support one another as guarantors of each other\u2019s loans.\r\n\r\nThe Cariari region is located in the province of Limon. In this rural area, life has been difficult due to a lack of job opportunities, family responsibilities, low levels of formal education and a lack of available financial services. Their challenging situation has resulted in a communal initiative to create work for themselves by engaging wholeheartedly in the purchase, rearing and sale of pigs.\r\n\r\nIn order to fund the development of their businesses each woman is applying for a loan of 100,000 colons (roughly US$180). Their loans will be used to purchase piglets and nutritional food that will ensure their growth into quality livestock products. The pigs will be sold to people in the community for direct consumption or resale. From November to December is the high season for the group, the reason can be summed up in one word: Tamales. Tamales are a traditional Costa Rican food eaten at Christmas time and their main ingredient is pork. As customer needs for pork meat increase, so too do the revenues of the \u201cLittle Ants\u201d.\r\n\r\nFor many of the group members, the responsibility of raising a family has fallen solely on their shoulders, rendering the income generated from pig sales a vital source of income. Despite their entrepreneurial spirit, their efforts have been hamstrung, partly due to exclusion from the traditional banking system. This is where you, through Kiva\u2019s lending model, can help.\r\n\r\nYour contribution is a direct investment in the betterment of the lives of women living in a poor community of Caribbean Costa Rica. By lending to these proactive and hardworking entrepreneurs, you are enabling them to help themselves.\r\n\r\nThe Group Members\r\n\r\nThese women identify most with the struggle of \u201clittle ants\u201d. The members observe that \u201cants work together and support one another day and night, in order to build something that is bigger than themselves.\u201d This can be taken to symbolize the group\u2019s aspirations for growth and approval for more loans in the future. The following detailed description of Flor M. A. A. can be considered as generally applicable to all the women in the group: they are all participants in similar economic activities in the Caribbean region of Costa Rica.\r\n\r\nFlor M. A. A. is the elected treasurer of this group. She is 38 years old and has not completed high school. She lives with her husband and two sons. Her husband is a farmer who grows plantains, rice and beans for family consumption and sells what he has left over.\r\n\r\nOn average, Flor earns 37,500 colons (roughly US$67) per month. At the moment, she has one pig; she would use this loan to purchase another. She would like to earn enough money from her pig-selling business so that she may buy a cow.\r\n\r\nFlor takes pride in managing her business with one hand while raising her children with the other. An obstacle for her, and for all the group members, is the high cost of nutrients for the pigs. Transportation is another challenge: walking to town to get the nutrients and hauling them back is a laborious task. When it rains heavily, the rise in the nearby river makes transport by bus impossible.\r\n\r\nThe members of The Women\u00b4s Bank of Little Ants have lived in the rural zone of Cariari for their entire lives. They are experienced in the trade of livestock and other agricultural activities; for example, Flor has been rearing pigs for the last fifteen years of her life. Your loan will help these women take the first steps in a loan cycle that leads to the end of poverty.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2000,"image":{"id":438214,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase piglets and pig feed","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Cariari","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":151,"posted_date":"2009-12-02T14:40:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yudi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Flor ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yorleny","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Neri ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marilyn ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yamileth ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Keylin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rocio ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elieth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Blanca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":1100000,"loan_amount":2000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":2000,"local_amount":1100000,"processed_date":"2010-06-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-16T07:40:31Z","rounded_local_amount":1106800.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152047909,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-12-02T20:12:51Z","paid_date":"2010-07-16T07:40:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":158104,"name":"Greisi","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Greisi es una socia  din\u00e1mica y trabajadora, vive en la ciudad de Pucallpa, regi\u00f3n de Ucayali, tiene 38 a\u00f1os, madre de un hijo adolescente, ella se dedica a la venta de prendas de vestir, esta actividad lo realiza en su casa, ya que ella trae de la ciudad de Lima su mercader\u00eda para vender.

O., 24, is a tortilla merchant.  She began her work with an initial investment of 2000 colones she got from her husband 5 years ago.  The tortilla shop is located in the URSS neighborhood in the eastern part of Managua.  She and her mother get up at 4am to start making the tortillas so that they can have the first batch done by 8am.  These tortillas will be sold by 1pm and she charges 1 colon.  The second batch is started at 2pm and ends at 6pm.  Besides the tortillas, she also sells cuajaditas (a local cheese) for 1 colon and cooked beans, for 5 colones.  The raw materials she consumes are:  firewood, which costs 120 colones for 60 pieces, Maseca (corn meal) at 155 colones for 25 pounds, and beans, at 8 colones per pound.  The financing is to repair her kitchen's roof which has 6 zinc metal sheets in very poor condition, and some wood beams; the remainder is to buy raw materials for the tortillas.

To continue with her tailoring business, Rita invested her first loan of 300 Peruvian soles in to the purchase of thread, elastic, silk lace, etc.  She currently needs a loan of 500 Peruvian soles, which will be used to buy fabric.  Rita's goal is to have a bigger sewing workshop and a showcase in which to hang her clothing.            \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Justine Raymond, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":436688,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"Purchase of fabric to make clothing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Pucallpa-Ucayali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2010-01-01T08:01:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":125}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-01-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:06:02Z","rounded_local_amount":253.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118118398,"comment":null},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2010-02-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:44:14Z","rounded_local_amount":126.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123954138,"comment":null},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2010-03-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-23T07:54:41Z","rounded_local_amount":126.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128987151,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-01-01T19:17:18Z","paid_date":"2010-04-23T07:54:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":158114,"name":"Lola Maqueda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora LOLA MAQUEDA, tiene  43 a\u00f1os, vive en el distrito Huanchaco de la provincia de Trujillo, departamento La Libertad \u2013 Per\u00fa.

I sold kerosene from my house, I boarded people, I cleaned houses, and I then sold gelatin and fruit lollipops.  I always had my husband\u2019s support.  \r\n\r\nThe time came when I decided to establish a small store.  To do this I bought a little bit of each thing (rice, sugar, eggs, noodles, potatoes, oil, milk, detergent, and others).  I invested the earnings each time in setting up the store more.  Now, my store is one of the best stocked in the area where I live.  This helped me build my house from strong material, help my mother, give my son a post high school education (police), and pay other expenses.\r\n\r\nI need the loan to get merchandise like detergent, rice, and sugar.

Ariunaa is 40 years old and lives with her two children in Zavkhan province in western Mongolia. She and her two children live together in a traditional Mongolian housing tent called a \"ger\".

She has worked hard to grow her business over the last two years but it has been difficult at times to lead a normal life. As her business is the only source of income for her family, she is focused on improving her skills as a shoemaker and expanding her business. The most important thing to her is being able to provide for her childrens' education. She says, \"education is very important in one's life and I want my children to become important people who will improve our society\". \r\n\r\nAriunaa has many plans for the future and hopes to soon purchase a more sophisticated sewing machine to make her business more efficient.

D. lives in the village of Brgy. Sibucao, San Enrique, Negros Occidental. She is 38 years old, married, with 3 school-age children. Her husband used to be a baker, but now he helps Aylen run their business.\r\n\r\nWhen her husband was earning a salary as a baker, Aylen stringently allocated the income on their household's needs. But she realized that as her children grew, their expenses would also increase and soon her husband's income would not be sufficient.\r\n\r\nThis encouraged her to join NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2001. She used the new capital to start a food vending business, selling food within her community and in the neighboring villages. She also put up a \"sari-sari\" or general store to ensure that she would have a regular daily income. The business performance was so good that the couple decided it would be more lucrative for her husband to manage their general store than earn a monthly salary as a baker. \r\n\r\nAs their business experience widened, they also took on new opportunities like selling vegetables. Now they earn a monthly income of 15,000 PHP, which is quite enough for the current needs of their family including the education of the children.\r\n\r\nAylen used her previous loan of 21,000 PHP as additional capital for her businesses. Now Aylen will use her 18th cycle loan of 22,000 PHP as working capital for her general store. Income from it will be used for house improvements.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":475175,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

a 69 year-old widow who continues to earn her own living because she wants to stay independent and also continue to help her children establish their own lives.\r\n\r\nNena G. has been a widow since 2006 and lives in the village of Barangay Palaka, Pulupandan, Negros Occidental. Her husband's death was a great loss to the family and since all of her seven children are grown up with their own families, Nena wanted to remain independent and be able to earn a living so that she could provide for her old age.\r\n\r\nYears ago Nena put up her general store to help her husband to raise income of the family to support its needs, especially as they had seven children. She said when she started her business, she found it quite hard to look after the needs of her children and at the same time handle the business, but she coped with all the hardships with much determination.\r\n\r\nBecause of Nena\u2019s hard work, her business grew, and she joined NWTF Project Dungganon (NWTF-PD) in 1998 so that she could access more capital for her business. With new capital infusion, she expanded her product offerings to include guinamos (shrimp paste) which is a popular flavoring and dish in the Philippines. She also traveled to other towns to sell her shrimp paste. Her guinamos was so popular that she now has regular customers, some from other towns, who prefer to buy their shrimp paste exclusively from her.\r\n\r\nNow, Nena earns a monthly income of PHP 18,000 and she saves most of this for her future security and for emergencies. She sometimes uses some of it to help out her children.\r\n\r\nNena\u2019s previous loan of Php 15,000 was used in her business as additional capital and it was repaid within her loan term in full and on-time, maintaining her good standing as an NWTF-PD member. Now she is borrowing Php 20,000 for her 15th loan to be utilized for her general store and her guinamos business.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":438449,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To use as

This is what Elsie M. is doing to attain her dreams with the help of NWTF-Project Dungganon.\r\n\r\nElsie is 40 years old, and married to Leonilo, who helps her run their scrap business. They have 4 children who are between 10 and 18 years old. 2 are in college and the younger 2 are in high school and grade school. The family lives in Prk. Kulitis, Barrio Dos Hermanas, Talisay City, Negros Occidental. It is one of Elsie's most cherished dreams that her children be able to finish college and have their own stable and comfortable livelihoods when they grow up.\r\n\r\nConcerned for her children's future, Elsie joined NWTF Project Dungganon in 2002 so that she could increase her capital in their scrap business. With the added buying capability, she was able to buy back more recyclables like scrap iron, bottles, plastic, etc. Now she is earning approximately PHP 30,000 per month from her business operations. \r\n\r\nFrom this she was able to buy a motorcycle and a small pickup truck for faster delivery of her scrap materials. She has also happily set aside some amount for her children's education.\r\n\r\nElsie's previous loan of PHP 15,000 was used as revolving capital for her scrap business and now that she's paid that off, she is borrowing the same amount so that she could continue maintaining her scrap buyback levels and be able to sell the scrap in volume, earning a neat profit.\r\n \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros  Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project <I>Dungganon<\/I>(a Hiligaynon word that means <I>Honorable<\/I>). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is  empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to  achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them <I>Dungganon<\/I> -  a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":436277,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Recycled Materials","sector":"Retail","use":"Additional Working Capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Silay, Negros Occidental","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":145,"posted_date":"2009-12-02T03:30:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elsie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":15000,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1153.84},{"due_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1153.84},{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1153.84},{"due_date":"2009-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1153.84},{"due_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1153.84},{"due_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1153.84},{"due_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1153.84},{"due_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1153.84},{"due_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1153.84},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1153.84},{"due_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1153.84},{"due_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1153.84},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1153.92}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":175,"local_amount":8077,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:59:40Z","rounded_local_amount":8225.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110739716,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":2308,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:15:06Z","rounded_local_amount":2350.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118129135,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":3461.08,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:53:54Z","rounded_local_amount":3524.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123965932,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":1153.92,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:37:38Z","rounded_local_amount":1175.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128997843,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-12-02T04:39:35Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T09:37:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":158210,"name":"Benkan Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Les membres du groupe Benkan sont des femmes mari\u00e9es ayant une moyenne  d\u2019\u00e2ge de 40 ans et 2 enfants.

He is 53 years old, married and father of a 28 years old son who attends school. Ab\u00edlio studied up to the 9th grade e did not continue due to lack of financial conditions. He lives in his own house with his family and supports his mother, who lives with him. He also pays his daughter's school and food expenses.\r\n<p>\r\nHe has never moved from the place where he lives. He has built a new house beside his parents' house, and there is where he lives with his family today. He is a full-time trader, and the owner of his business for more than 25 years. He works in average 10 hours a day, and earns approximately MZN 12,000 a month. He uses his earning to pay for the house expenses and he also saves some money at the commercial bank BIM. \r\n<p>\r\nHe has had loans from the credit union TCHUMA. Later on, he learned about Hluvuku through neighbors who are also clients of this institution and decided to request his first loan. This is his third loan, of MZN 15,000, with which he intends to buy products (beer, juice, dry beverages and soft drinks) in order to increase his merchandise. The former loans were of MZN 9,000 and MZN 15,500, all destined to the same activity. \r\n <p>\r\nIn the future, he wishes to request more loans in order to expand his yard and to buy a vehicle as means to transport merchandise. \r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Giovanna Fernandes, Kiva

G. lives in the village of Hda Alejandria in Barangay La Granja, La Carlota City, Negros Occidental. She is 46 years old, married, and blessed with 3 children between 11 to 23 years old, with the oldest already in college. Her dream is for her children to finish their studies and help her to improve their lives. \r\n\r\nMany years ago, she worked as a bookkeeper in a sugar cane plantation, but she lost her job when the farm was divided among the long-time laborers through the government's agrarian reform program. Her employer offered to transfer her to their home office in the city, but she refused the offer because she wanted to stay close to her family.\r\n\r\nThe new development in her life prompted her to start her own business to help her husband support their family. In 2003, she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon to get access to capital so that she could open a general store. Because of her business background, she proved to be a good entrepreneur and her business soon flourished and expanded to include RTW (ready-to-wear) clothes and electronic loading (of pre-paid credits for text messaging) of mobile phones. She was also able to invest in a poultry business, starting with just 12 chicken. She now raises 41 chickens, which contributes a lot to her family's income. Her net profit per month averages PHP 6,400 (~ $139 USD). \r\n\r\nShe used her previous loan of Php 7,000 as additional capital for her general store. That loan was fully repaid without delay. Now for her 16th loan, she is borrowing Php 19,500 to buy additional chicks, feed, and vitamins for her poultry business. She plans to use the income from her loan to pay for her children's education and other family expenses.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros  Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the  lives of thousands of women through Project  \"Dungganon\" (a Hiligaynon word that means \"Honorable\"). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is  empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to  achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a  life path that will ultimately make them \"Dungganon\" -  a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has  earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":436354,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy

She is 57 years old, single, and the mother of 3 children who are 29, 30, and 31 years old.  They each live in their own home.  She only studied through 2nd grade and did not continue because her parents made her work on a small farm and in a cattle pasture.  She lives in a rented house with a grandson and does not support anyone else besides him.\r\n\r\nShe lived in the Cabo Delgado province in northern Mozambique from 1983 to 2003 when her husband worked in that part of the country.  She is a merchant and has owned her own business for more than 7 years.  She sells peanuts, oleo, beans, and brings in about 800 MZN per day, which she puts toward family expenses.  She even saves some through Xitique (a traditional system of revolving savings).\r\n\r\nShe has had four loans with the Credit Cooperative (CCP) but later decided to stop.  She became familiar with Hluvuku through a friend (Mrs. Florinda Timane), who is a client of the institution.  This is her 2nd loan, which has a value of 10,000 MZN.  She would use this to buy products (beans, flour, peanuts, etc.) in order to expand and further diversify her merchandise.  Her previous loan of 5,000 MZN was used for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nIn the future, she would like to request a loan to build a house, since she actually lives in a rented one.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br

Eufracia C. is happily married and gifted with four children. She operates a business which is the buying and selling of junk items. Her average gross sales is about 2,000 pesos per day which can really help with their daily expenditures.\n\nEufracia sells her junk items daily. She is requesting a loan of 5,750 pesos so she can buy more junk items which she will then sell again. She is quite happy in her business and has it expand as people become more aware of recycling. \n  \nEufracia is already on her 8th loan and her previous loan was 5,500 pesos.

O. is a single man, 23 years old, and he lives in Kabarnet town. James' loan is for Kshs 40,000 and this is the first loan he has ever taken from an MFI. James owns a tailoring shop, which he started three years ago. From his business, he makes a profit of Kshs 12,000 a month. With this loan of Kshs 40,000 James wants to expand his business by purchasing textiles worth Kshs 10,000, buttons worth Kshs 3000, and a new machine worth Kshs 15,000 and use the rest for transport and other needed materials for his business. \r\n\r\nJames was introduced to KADET LTD by a friend who was already a KADET client. James' customers are residents of Kabarnet town and the surrounding area. James hopes this loan helps his business reach the point where he can employ others as tailors. James' dream is to expand his business and even open another business in a nearby town. He also hopes to buy a plot of land where he will build himself a house, marry and have a happy family.\r\n\r\nJames describes himself as a hardworking and focused man.\r\n\r\nAbout KADET: \r\nThe Kenya Agency for the Development of Enterprise and Technology (KADET) is dedicated to economically empower her clients by providing financial services to improve living conditions of micro-entrepreneurs and their children across Kenya.

The family has access to electricity but no piped water and gets three meals a day.  She incurs transport costs to and from buying Bitengi (African attire) from Arua, one of the many districts of northern Uganda and uses public transport to and from shopping. She works in a semi-urban area, which is on the outskirts of Kampala. Betty works six days a week. She receives an average of four customers a day and sells to all categories of people. She moves door-to-door selling African attire. Her major business challenges are highway thieves and the rainy season, which hinders her movements.  Betty has been in this business for four years and with MCDT for seven years, servicing her 14th loan. She wants to use this loan to buy more African attire. She hopes to see her business grow bigger and to own a permanent business

In this area, however, running water (none of which is potable) and electricity are unreliable. She makes her home here in a simple structure with her husband and 4 children.\r\n\r\nAna is excited to be taking her second loan with Esperanza after having successfully repaid her previous loan.
