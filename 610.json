He sells CD\u2019s and DVD\u2019s of movies and music. He supports his family with this activity that he has been doing for the past four years. Ariel began working as a roving salesperson, selling music CD\u2019s, when he was 22 years old. His wife provided the money to start this CD sales business. He sold CD\u2019s on the street, at fairs, at recreation events, in parks and he walked through neighborhoods selling CD\u2019s. He didn\u2019t have a fixed schedule or salary. Both of these depended on what he sold during the day. Today, thanks to great effort and hard work, he has a small store where he sells CD\u2019s and DVD\u2019s. He doesn\u2019t have to be a roving salesperson anymore. He is asking for this loan in order to have working capital. He would like to have a larger variety of CD\u2019s and DVD\u2019s in order to have a larger variety of goods to offer his customers. He hopes that with this investment he will be able to expand his business. He now sells, at larger quantities, his product to other roving street vendors. For this reason he needs sufficient merchandise. In the future he would like to have a store that sells basic grains in order to have another source of income so he is not as dependant on CD sales. His next goal is to increase his music CD sales and DVD sales.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":516.68,"image":{"id":787897,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Music Discs & Tapes","sector":"Retail","use":"buy CD's and DVD's of music and movies so that he can provide a larger assortment to his customers.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, Western culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only seven percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients have viable business propositions. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.

A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only seven percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients have viable business propositions.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This is 34-year-old Gladys (holding the yellow folder) from Masvingo. She is married with five children aged 4, 8, 9, 12 and 14. Three of her children attend school.  Gladys has operated a retail business selling clothes and footwear at the rail station flea market for 5 years. She says the main challenge she faces is competition from other sellers. Gladys has requested a loan of $400 to purchase clothing and footwear stock. She says the extra income generated as a result of this loan will allow her to send her children to school.

They are a happy-go-lucky family and love to get together for reunions, especially on the weekends. To support his family, Dominic relies on income from his pub business in Ntungamo. At his pub, he sells a variety of both hard and soft beverages. This means he needs to restock to be able to meet the demands of patrons who frequent his pub.

He is 46 years old, married and lives with his wife Marina, his mother and his 8-month-old son. \r\n\r\nThe main source of income for the family is selling wine. Otar purchases wine locally and sells it in Samegrelo Region. He earns approximately 400 Laris per month. He started this business three years ago and gained quite good experience. He finds it more profitable to produce wine in his cellar and sell it on the same market, where he already has business contacts, as well as customers. \r\n\r\nThe family also owns three milk cows, whose dairy products are sold in the village. \r\n\r\nWith the requested credit Otar will renovate his cellar and all equipment needed for wine production. His profit will increase when he switches to selling his own wine. Part of the income received by Otar will be saved and used for cultivation (planting) of the vineyard.

He is a resident of San Jacinto, a town in the Department of Bol\u00edvar, where he is well-known for being a good citizen and a meat vendor.  Carlos has a butcher shop where he sells meat by the ounce, by the pound, or by the kilo according to the needs of his customers.  His experience included a traditional upbringing.  Carlos learned his trade from his father and now he has his own business, which allows him to earn enough income to support his family.

He has the necessary equipment for his job such as knives, cleavers, tables, and a freezer with very good storage capacity of which he needs to make more effective use.  His plans going forward are to modernize his butcher shop with special machines and to secure a well-equipped location near his home.  The greatest challenge he faces is dealing with the sporadic power outages that occur whenever the town has to perform maintenance and repairs.  As a result, he has to resort to the old technique of salting the meats in order to preserve them.  He encourages his customers to prepare a delicious stew that includes three types of salted meat.  In the meantime, Carlos works toward generating a profit margin of no less than 17% from his sales.  He continually strives to improve his operating capital by securing financing.  \r\n<p>\r\nFor this reason, he has come to Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo to apply for his first loan.

To date, she considers the business to be very profitable because she has regular customers that always consume and are quite exacting with their requests for the food she prepares.  The business has helped her improve her economy and she has an income that\u2019s important for her home.  Besides, she\u2019s able to attend classes in the afternoon thus attaining her wish for self improvement.  Because of all this she\u2019s hoping to have support from all of you.\r\n\r\nThis is her 5th loan with MFP.

She is part of a strong, close knit family that is made up of her husband Roy with whom she has been married 20 years.  They have 2 children, Pol and Kiefen,  who they care for and protect.  As a daughter of farmers she started planting coffee,avocados and tangerines on the land she inherited from her parents more than 8 years ago.  Her willingness to work and her husband's dedication to getting ahead prompted her to save the money she received from her crop sales to the middlemen in her region.  With her savings she was able to open a drug store 5 years ago.  Along with her business, she has a house that they recently finished building where she rents rooms to students and laborers that come the region.  She also rents part of her house as a restaurant to three people for extra income every month.  Her main concern is her working capital since every 5 months she invests an average of 5,000 nuevos soles [Peruvian currency] in stock for her drug store. This doesn't discourage her from striving toward her goal to be able to be profitable enough to generate her own capital.  She also thought it would be advantageous to have her own restaurant because she thinks it will be more profitable.  \r\n\r\nShe belongs the communal bank \"Flor de caf\u00e9\" and this is her sixth loan with MFP.

They used the loan her partner requested to make repairs, according to Costa Rican laws, so they can drive around.\r\n\r\nMireidi needs a loan at this time because, in light of current market difficulties, she would like to introduce new kinds of ice cream to cover other market segments and obtain a higher profit margin.  They feel that the line of products they currently offer has stagnated so they've got to innovate with new ones if they want to stay competitive.  \r\n\r\nMireidi lives with her husband and a son, who studies at the university.  She gets up early, does the housework, and at 8:30 she and her partner go out delivering ice cream in her truck, returning in late afternoon. She has an excellent credit history with Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer and this is her sixth loan.  The loans allow her to grow and have served to strengthen her microbusiness and provide support to her son in college.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":491.67,"image":{"id":788448,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to introduce a new product line so she can improve her financial situation.

There, she started her family with Hugo, with whom she has lived for twelve years. They have two children, Jony and Yamerin, who they care for with love and dedication. Like a good country woman, she is dedicated to farming. Her main crops are coffee and bananas, which are sown in her own agricultural lands, made up of one hectare of arable land. Since she doesn't have much capital to invest in her crops, she always worked with her community bank. \"I am one of the founders\", she affirms with a lot of pride. What she likes most about her work is to be able to sell her crops to the gatherers who visit her area. She mentions, \"I don't have to transport my merchandise.\" Additionally, she receives the support of her husband who works as farm laborer in different farming lands, earning extra money for the home. Now, Yanet ventured into the production of coffee nurseries, where she earns S.400 for each thousand grown. She also works in her free time making wooden drawers to hold the fruit they produce. She belongs to the \"Luz del future\" (Future light) community bank and this is the fourth loan with MFP, where she is very happy to know that she will have financial support. On the other hand, she promises to again make her payments on time, as she did with previous loans. Additionally, she is thankful to be a part of her community bank because all of its members are responsible and very unified people .

Her main crops are coffee and citrus fruits.  However, ten years ago she was able to get her own property.  This was due to the hard work she did with her coffee crops.  Over time she got together the capital she needed to open a business selling groceries, sweets, and drinks.  She has been doing this for only four years.  This was enough time to be able to offer the local residents good service, and, above all, a good price.  This led her to earning more income every day.\r\n\r\nNow Fortunata sells her fruit production in the capital, but she does this without neglecting her business.  She considers coffee sales to be very unstable.  Lately the price of coffee beans has been increasing, and at other times the price has been very low.

She also works on a loom and often uses recycled materials. She has had the workshop where she does her work for 9 years and they call it the \"multiple\" workshop because she of the diversity of artwork that she produces. To make her crafts, Bernardita buys wood at low prices, but most of her other heavy materials are recycled. \r\n\r\nShe takes commissions but also creates her own innovative work like wooden signs. With the loan, she will buy sandpaper, paint, wool, paint thinner, Betumen of Judea (used to create a patina effect) and will repair an electric tool that she uses in her artwork. \r\n\r\nHer goals are to continue developing classes and workshops to keep her craft skills up to date. Her dreams are also to share and transmit to the other members of the communal bank everything she has learned about crafts. She wants to continue being an artist and to continue working. Bernardita completed free classes in weaving with the Mapuche (indigenous people of Chile). She is very grateful for the opportunity that Fondo Esperanza has given her, not just for the loans but also for the values that Fondo Esperanza promotes, like solidarity and trust. \r\n\r\nValpara\u00edso is located 120 kilometers northeast of Santiago.

Tumurtulga is 57 years old and a  driving instructor.

He owns a plot of land and a family house on it. He has 2 other children who are grown up, both University graduates who live separately with their families. To give them proper education Tumurtulga spent all his savings and income while they were a students until 2009. \r\n\r\nSince then, he has gradually improved his family\u2019s living conditions. Two years ago Tumurtulga bought a family car, and last year he did some light improvements to his house. This time he is planning to do proper restoration to his family house by making the walls thicker and the house warmer to withstand Mongolian harsh winters. To do that he needs to buy rockwool insulation materials and to put them under floor, in all the walls and the roof, plus replace the doors and windows with double-glazed ones. Finally, the house will become warm and more efficient in the use of charcoal (for heat) as well as greener.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
