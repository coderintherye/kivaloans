Macor\u00eds, Dominican Republic. He is the coordinator for his group, Mujeres en Desarrollo (Women in Development), and his story is representative of the other borrowers in the group.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, Maximo and his fellow borrowers live in Batey Margarita. Bateyes are small, rural communities built by sugar companies for their field workers. Bateyes are isolated, have no running water, and have unreliable electricity at best. Maximo lives with his wife and four children, the youngest of whom is six years old. This is Maximo\u2019s sixth loan with Esperanza International.\r\n\r\nMaximo runs a successful colmado, which is the local version of a small general store. With his loan, he plans to buy foods such as rice, beans, flour, and oil, as well as gasoline and some clothing to sell to his community.

If successful, they plan to build their own warehouse, pay school fees for their children, and continue to build a secure future for themselves and their families.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2125,"image":{"id":421478,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy additional goods for their business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"RW","country":"Rwanda","town":"KABUG A","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":117,"posted_date":"2009-11-08T14:40:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jeanne D' Arc","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Salom ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Athanase ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Damas ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Faustin ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felix","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Asshula","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Shella ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esperence ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mathieu","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Speciose ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Celestin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"RWF","disbursal_amount":1200000,"loan_amount":2125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2010-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2010-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2010-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2010-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2010-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":200000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":354.17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":354.16},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":354.17},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":354.17},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":354.16},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":354.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":354.17,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2009-12-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T18:08:11Z","rounded_local_amount":201166.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110782214,"comment":null},{"amount":354.16,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2010-01-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:49:50Z","rounded_local_amount":201166.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118169311,"comment":null},{"amount":354.17,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2010-02-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:35:24Z","rounded_local_amount":201166.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":124008313,"comment":null},{"amount":354.17,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2010-03-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T10:16:39Z","rounded_local_amount":201166.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129037532,"comment":null},{"amount":354.16,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2010-04-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:36:08Z","rounded_local_amount":201166.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136760205,"comment":null},{"amount":354.17,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2010-05-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-17T08:10:30Z","rounded_local_amount":201166.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":145022636,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-11-10T12:58:30Z","paid_date":"2010-06-17T08:10:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":150359,"name":"Bolale","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Bolale sells drinks, wine and juice at retail prices to her customers.

M. is 45 years old, married with five children aged between 7 and 25 years, and she takes care of one dependent as well. Agnes lives in the Gatsibo district, approximately four hours drive from Kigali, the capital city of Rwanda.\r\n\r\nIt is in this area that, since 2004, Agnes has operated her business of selling petroleum (gasoline), a much-needed household supply in Rwanda. The hours of her business require that she works from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. every day.\r\n\r\nAlthough Agnes has been in this business for five years, she would like a loan in order to expand her working capital which will help her to pay her suppliers and get lower rates for her products. All of this should result in increasing the profits of her business. For that to happen, she is requesting her first loan from Kiva lenders via Vision Finance Company.\r\n\r\nWith this business expansion, Agnes hopes to get more customers.

With this, her first loan with Esperanza, she will expand her sales to include fruits and vegetables. In the past, it was not viable for Maria to purchase such perishable items.

That way, it will be secure from thieves and safer as a shelter during hurricane season.

In addition, Olita runs a small shop from her home, selling clothing to her neighbors and friends. Needless to say, a small house containing seven people and a business is a little cramped.<p>\r\n\r\nFor this reason, Olita hopes to someday rent or own her own shop. This would free up quite a bit of space in her home, giving her family a more comfortable living space. With her current loan, Olita plans on purchasing more clothing to sell in her shop.

She is the coordinator for her group, La Reforma (Reform), and her story is representative of the other borrowers in her group.\r\n<p>\r\nMarhta and the other women in La Reforma live in Consuelo, a small town just to the north of San Pedro. Consuelo lacks any kind of reliable electricity and has no potable running water. Marhta has a three-year-old daughter and lives with her mother. \r\n<p>\r\nMarhta runs a successful colmado from her home. Colmados are small general stores that sell anything from bread to batteries. Marhta focuses on the sale of food in her colmado, specifically the staples of the Dominican cuisine: rice, beans, flour, oil, and plantains. With her new loan, she will purchase more of these items, along with an expanded selection of beverages.\r\n<p>\r\nMarhta hopes to save enough money from her business to buy her family a home. Their current home is on loan from a friend, and Marhta dreams of having a place she can call her own someday.

The products are sold in cash or on credit at the fairs in Dougabougou, Sibila, Siribala, Boussin, and Diamarabougou to a mixed clientele.\r\nThey foresee making an average monthly profit of 53,000 FCFA, which will be used for their business and to buy piece by piece their daughters' wedding trousseaus.\r\nTheir goal is to maintain their collaboration with Soro Yiriwaso in order to increase as much as possible the size of their businesses by saving and obtaining further loans.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Vilas Menon, Kiva

He resides with his wife and children in Flaba, a village located 14 km from the city of Bougouni (3rd administrative region of the Republic of Mali).  At age 15, Mr. Hamadi dropped out of Koran school (which he used to attend) for farm work, to his parents\u2019 benefit.  A few years later, he started doing revenue-generating work during the slow periods.  \r\n\r\nToday, his commercial work has surpassed farming.  For six years now, he has been in business buying and selling grains (millet, corn, fonio, rice, etc.)   This business operates in town, and some of the goods are sold at the Bougouni marketplace when the fair takes place.  \r\n\r\nConcerned about expanding his enterprise, he decided to join Soro Yiriwaso, with which he is now on his third individual loan after having repaid the two previous ones.  This new loan will be used to buy sacks of grain a little at a time.  Supplies are gotten from producers from villages surrounding Bougouni.  And sales are made in cash at the retail level to customers composed of retailers and consumers.  \r\n\r\nHe envisions realizing a monthly profit of 75,000 francs CFA.  With the profits, he envisions expanding his enterprise further.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":421620,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","use":"To buy grain ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Bougouni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.416667 -7.483333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-11-09T22:50:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hamadi","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":125000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":287.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":287.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":287.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":287.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":287.5,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2010-02-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:18:28Z","rounded_local_amount":126771.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123991206,"comment":null},{"amount":287.5,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:09Z","rounded_local_amount":126771.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144778835,"comment":null},{"amount":287.5,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:58:01Z","rounded_local_amount":126771.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166913246,"comment":null},{"amount":287.5,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:14Z","rounded_local_amount":126771.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177476500,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-11-20T01:50:49Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":150415,"name":"Tepetlapa Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La comunidad de San Antonio Tepetlapa se encuentra ubicada en una zona monta\u00f1osa al norte de Pinotepa Nacional Oaxaca., a 70 KM aproximadamente, los habitantes hablan dialecto mixteco 100%, digenas alli se encuentra formado el grupo solidario TEPETLAPA, integrado por cinco personas la representante es la sra.

Hueyapan (San Andr\u00e9s Hueyapan) est\u00e1 a 2340 metros de altitud, el significado de Hueyapan en n\u00e1huatl significa: (Hueyi : mucha  Atlat: Agua, \"LUGAR DE MUCHA AGUA\"\n \n     Bueno en esta ocasi\u00f3n les hablare del grupo Hueyapan que llevan el nombre de su misma localidad, este grupo esta integrado por 5 personas las cuales son:  CELIA M. F., JUSTINA A. S., YOLANDA R. M., YOLANDA A. CORTES Y HERLINDA P. A. con la ultima de las acreditadas que se hace menci\u00f3n es de quien vamos hablar.\n  No tiene conocimiento de que o cual es el significado de su nombre,  la edad es de 48 a\u00f1os, curso hasta 6 a\u00f1os de primaria en la escuela que lleva por nombre actualmente \"CARLOS A. CARRILLO\" de su misma localidad hueyapan.\n\n     La Sra. Herlinda solicito un cr\u00e9dito a Fundacion Realidad, AC. Para poder comprar hilos por mayoreo de distintos colores, comprar tambi\u00e9n harina de trigo, lo anterior para la elaboraci\u00f3n de sus rebozos y gabanes, que es la actividad que la sra. realiza.\nSe preguntaran ustedes que tiene que ver la harina con la elaboraci\u00f3n de los rebozos.\n\n     Bueno la manera como la sra. prepara el hilo es de la siguiente manera: primero pone a hervir agua y le vierte la harina de trigo, cuando la mezcla adquiere la consistencia de atole, lo retira de lo caliente y lo pone a enfriar, al ya estar fri\u00f3,  vierte el hilo tipo lana,  lo deja aproximadamente 30 minutos dentro, para que el hilo se ablande y no tenga una consistencia r\u00edgida para posteriormente ella poder manipularlo con mas facilidad al momento de estar  hil\u00e1ndolo,  o tejiendo en otras palabras.\n \n\n\nuna vez que lo saca de su mezcla lo exprime y  lo coloca en su tejedor y comienza a tejer el gab\u00e1n o rebozo, en este proceso de tejido se tarda un d\u00eda completo para terminarlo una vez terminado lo lava con jab\u00f3n de pasta neutro y lo pone a secar al sol con esto termina el proceso de la elaboraci\u00f3n de un gab\u00e1n hecho por manos artesanas as\u00ed sucesivamente los va elaborando cada uno. \n\n\nTambi\u00e9n se dedica al cultivo de flor de temporada por ejemplo,  ahora en este mes de Noviembre sembr\u00f3 flor de  CEMPAZUCHITL por las festividades del d\u00eda de  MUERTOS y otras F. mas de temporada.\n\n     Ella se integro al grupo de HUEYAPAN en el segundo ciclo,  actualmente es su segundo cr\u00e9dito con el grupo, ella fue invitada  por la Sra. Yolanda R. M.,  la cual es la representante del grupo,  la sra. Yolanda se dedica a la  cosecha de fruta de temporada, tiene huertos de:(MANZANA, PERA, HIGOS, AGUACATE, CAJINICUILES ESTAS SON UNA COMO BAHINAS QUE LLEVAN POR DENTRO UNA ESPECIE DE ALGODINCITOS DULCES, LES PUEDO DECIR QUE SON MUY SABROSOS, TEJOCOTE DE TEMPORADA, la SRA. CELIA M. es mam\u00e1 soltera: Es la mas relajienta del grupo, ella se dedica a la crianza de borregos y tambi\u00e9n tiene una peque\u00f1a huerta de frutas de temporada, Do\u00f1a YOLANDA A. es la integrante mas penosa, no quer\u00eda tomarse la foto con el grupo por que dice que no quieren la vean por Internet sus hijos all\u00e1 en el norte, la Sra. JUSTINA A., ella cuenta con una peque\u00f1a papeler\u00eda y venta de \u00fatiles escolares.\n\n     Bueno regresando con la Sra. Herlinda que es de  quien hablamos, ella tiene su negocio en su propia casa de hecho sus clientes llegan hasta su domicilio para comprarle los rebozos y gabanes, y por su cuenta ella va a las plazas mas cercanas a su comunidad a venderlos,  ya que aun no cuenta con un local establecido donde pudiera exhibir su producto.\n\n Esta actividad la aprendi\u00f3 a la edad de 10 a\u00f1os, su abuelita materna fue la que le ense\u00f1o a elaborarlos.\n\n Sus ingresos son buenos   les gana el 10% o 15% por cada prenda que vende pero no es su \u00fanico ingreso, aparte de ello tambi\u00e9n cuenta con una huerta de \u00e1rboles frutales, crianza y venta de borregos. Ella es una persona muy trabajadora y entusiasta.\n \n    Ella realiza su actividad en su propia casa en SAN ANDRES (HUEYAPAN), le es de mucha importancia seguir dedic\u00e1ndose a esta actividad por que sabe que son  muy pocos artesanos la que la realizan aqu\u00ed en el estado de Morelos aunado a que es herencia de su abuelita.\n\n  La parte que mas le gusta de este trabajo es porque sabe que son indispensables estas prendas en su comunidad debido a que casi todo el a\u00f1o hace mucho fri\u00f3 y que de ello ha sacado adelante a sus hijos m\u00e1s peque\u00f1os.\n\n     Ella en su actividad y en su comunidad no tiene competencia, aunque s\u00ed ha enfrentado algunos desaf\u00edos; como los costosos precios de la materia prima y el tener que viajar constantemente a la ciudad de Cuautla para adquirirlos.\n\n  Do\u00f1a Herlinda,  conforme va recibiendo sus cr\u00e9ditos lo va invirtiendo de inmediato, ella en este ciclo solicito la cantidad de $ 5,000.00 pesos, para la compra del material y como ella trabaja sola no se da abasto para  elaborar mas producto,  pues se ve apurada y necesita contratar a mas gente para producir m\u00e1s de lo que ella hace y quiere a darse a conocer con alg\u00fan buen comprador de mayoreo y hacer crecer su negocio.\n\n\nLa Sra. Herlinda es viuda desde hace un a\u00f1o, tiene 6 hijos, el hijo mayor se llama Lorenzo, el se fue a estados unidos desde hace 4 a\u00f1os, el segundo se llama Genaro el es empleado de un restaurante, el tercero se llama Alejandro el vive con do\u00f1a herlinda y le ayuda en casa y se dedica al campo, su \u00fanica hija se llama Judith es una se\u00f1orita de 18 a\u00f1os y ella trabaja como empleada en la ciudad de Cuernavaca y por ultimo los 2 peque\u00f1itos que son: Julio que va en segundo de Secundaria y Alberto en 4\u00ba. De Primaria ellos conforman su familia actualmente.\n\nElla hace menci\u00f3n sobre su parte del pueblo, me dice que es un clima muy fri\u00f3 pero la tierra en la que cultivan es muy generosa con ellos, por que todo el a\u00f1o sus \u00e1rboles frutales le dan mucha producci\u00f3n. Su casa esta construida con block de adobe de una sola planta con 3 cuartos y techo de l\u00e1mina de asbesto. De antemano su negocio le a ayudado mucho desde que su esposo falleci\u00f3 por que de ello se a mantenido y a salido adelante.\n\nSus planes de esperanza que ella tiene es que en un futuro pueda exportar sus prendas y tener un buen comprador para darse a conocer su artesan\u00eda.\n\nElla esta feliz y contenta por la oportunidad que le dieron de ser parte de Fundacion Realidad, A.C. como acreditada.\n\n    \u201cAgradecimiento por el pr\u00e9stamo que adquiri\u00f3 y por confiar en ella y agradecerles  por existir Fundacion Realidad,  gracias por  ayudar  y comprender la situaci\u00f3n de cada uno de los integrantes y de cada localidad a la que visitan y forman grupos para apoyarlo para mejorar su calidad de vida y la de nuestras familias,  muchas,  muchas gracias por ser una micro financiera de apoyo y ayuda.\u201d\n\n","en":"The community of San Andr\u00e9s Hueyapan (or Hueyapan, for short) is situated in the town of T\u00e9tela del Volc\u00e1n in the State of Morelos.  It has 6014 inhabitants.  Hueyapan is 2340 meters above sea level.  In the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Nahuatl\" target=\"_blank\" >Nahuatl<\/a> language, Hueyapan means \u201cplace of abundant water\u201d (Hueyi = \u201cmany\u201d; Atlat = \u201cwater\u201d).\r\n<p>\r\nThe Hueyapan Group bears the same name as this location.  It is composed of 5 members:  Celia M. F., Justina A. Sardi\u00f1as, Yolanda R. M., Yolanda A. Cortex, and Herlinda P. A..  We will focus on Herlinda\u2019s story.\r\n<p>  \r\nNot knowing what her name means, Herlinda is 48 years old.  She completed her education through the 6th grade at the Carlos A. Carillo School in Hueyapan.  Sra. Herlinda requested a loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad in order to buy yarn in different colors at wholesale.   In addition, she will purchase wheat flour to use in making shawls.  You\u2019re probably wondering what flour has to do with producing shawls.  Herlinda prepares the yarn in the following manner:\r\n<p>\r\nFirst, she combines flour and boiled water.  When the mixture becomes the consistency of porridge, she allows it to cool before adding the woolen yarn.  She lets the yarn soak in the flour mixture for 30 minutes or until it no longer has a rigid consistency.  This process makes the yarn easier to manipulate for weaving.  After the yarn is finished soaking, any excess mixture is squeezed out before the yarn is washed with neutral soap and set out to dry in the sun.  The entire process takes a full day and prepares the yarn for use in handicrafts.\r\n<p>\r\nIn addition, Herlinda also grows seasonal flowers.  For example, in the month of November, the <i>cempazuchitl<\/i> (a miniature yellow marigold, an Aztec symbol of death) is planted for the \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Day_of_the_dead\" target=\"_blank\" >D\u00eda de los Muertos<\/a>\u201d celebrations.\r\n<p>\r\nHerlinda recently joined the Hueyapan Group, which is now in its second loan cycle.  She was invited by Yolanda R. M., the group leader.  Sra. Yolanda has several orchards where she grows seasonal fruits such as apples, pears, figs, avocados, <i>cajinicuiles<\/i> (a tropical fruit with flesh that looks like cotton candy), and <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tejocote\" target=\"_blank\" >tejocote<\/a>.  Sra. Celia M. is a single mother and the most relaxed member of the group.  She raises sheep and also has a small fruit orchard.  Do\u00f1a Yolanda Argon is the most guarded member.  She did not want her photograph taken so that her children would not see her on the Internet.  Sra. Justina A. manages a small stationery shop where she sells school supplies.  \r\n<p>\r\nGetting back to Herlinda\u2019s story, she operates a home business in Hueyapan where her customers visit her to purchase shawls and overcoats.  She says she also travels to other venues closest to her community to sell her products since she does not have an established vending location.  Herlinda started weaving when she was 10 years old and learned this skill from her maternal grandmother.  \r\n<p>\r\nHerlinda makes a profit of 10 to 15 percent from each garment that she sells.  Apart from her agricultural activities, this is her only source of income.  She is a hardworking and enthusiastic person.  This business is very important to her because it represents an extension of her grandmother\u2019s heritage.  She faces very little competition since there are few craftspeople who work in the State of Morelos.  However, Herlinda still faces some challenges.  The cost of materials is high and she must travel constantly to the city of Cuautla to acquire them.  She is proud of the fact that her garments are indispensable in her community because of the cold that exists for most of the year.  Another benefit of the business is that it has enabled her younger children to get ahead.\r\n<p>\r\nDo\u00f1a Herlinda will immediately apply her loan of 5000 MXN toward the purchase of materials.  Since she works alone, she cannot generate more items on her own.  She feels rushed and needs to hire more people to produce more garments.  Herlinda hopes to come into contact with a good wholesale buyer so that she can grow her business.\r\n<p>\r\nShe became a widow last year.  Herlinda\u2019s six children are as follows:\r\n-    Lorenzo is her eldest son and left for the United States four years ago.\r\n-    Her second child Genaro is employed at a restaurant.\r\n-    Her third child Alejandro lives with her and helps around the house and on the farm.\r\n-    Her only daughter is named Judith.  She is 18 years old and works as a clerk in the city of Cuernevaca.\r\n-    Julio attends high school.\r\n-    Alberto is in fourth grade.\r\n<p>\r\nIn her part of town, the climate is very cold but the land is fertile and enables their fruit trees to be productive.  Her single floor house is made of adobe blocks.  It has three rooms and an asbestos sheet roof.  Now that her husband has passed away, her business enables her to maintain her lifestyle and move forward.  In the future, she hopes to export her garments and become connected with a good buyer that specializes in handicrafts.\r\n<p>\r\nHerlinda says she is satisfied and happy to be given the opportunity to be part of Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad.  She says, \u201cWe are grateful that Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad exists and for the loan that was provided to us.  They take the time to understand the situation of each member and the communities in which they live.  By forming support groups, we are able to help each other improve the quality of life for our families.  We are very, very thankful that Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad is a microfinance institute that provides both support services and financial assistance.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1300,"image":{"id":420835,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","use":"Purchase yarn in different colors & kilos of flour","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"HUEYAPAN MORELOS","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2009-11-08T03:10:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yolanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Herlinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Justina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Celia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yolanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":17000,"loan_amount":1300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2125},{"due_date":"2009-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":2125},{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":2125},{"due_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":2125},{"due_date":"2009-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":2125},{"due_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2125},{"due_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":2125},{"due_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":2125}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":502.49,"local_amount":6571,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:41:47Z","rounded_local_amount":6676.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103794848,"comment":null},{"amount":325.23,"local_amount":4253,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:57:27Z","rounded_local_amount":4321.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110686008,"comment":null},{"amount":309.78,"local_amount":4051,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:38:51Z","rounded_local_amount":4115.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118080340,"comment":null},{"amount":162.5,"local_amount":2125,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:15:26Z","rounded_local_amount":2158.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123916663,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-11-08T14:42:19Z","paid_date":"2010-03-15T10:15:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":150418,"name":"Cesar Augusto","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Cesar Augusto de 36 a\u00f1os de edad es casado, tiene 2 ni\u00f1os, de 14 y 4 a\u00f1os respectivamente, labora para la Alcaldia de Juigalpa como colector de ingresos desde hace 11 a\u00f1os.

Sandra Elizabeth, secretary of the bank, is a person who is very determined and proactive, and the other members of the bank have similar personalities.  The president, Alberto, makes sporting clothes.  Senora Missel sells cellular phones in a market in the city.  Sandra sells office supplies (scotch tape, etc.) wholesale, which she distributes in the different markets in the city.  Other members sell food from their homes and another member repairs cell phones and computers.  While there are other similar businesses in the area where they are developing their activities, the affluence of the consumers in the markets and the constant urban growth makes it such that the activities that they are developing are not affected. On the contrary, many of the members are hoping to grow their businesses and for this reason they are requesting this loan.  The members are requesting this loan in order to acquire merchandise in greater quantity, others to buy new machines to increase their production, others to buy raw materials in quantity and thus increase their working capital.  This group is in its first credit cycle, but the majority of them already know each other and have experience working with this type of credit.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar,

three children but still has the energy of a 15-year-old. She is a member of the \"Las Madres Trabajadoras de San Juan\" (\"Hard-working mothers of San Juan\") community bank group, which got its name because the members are all mothers looking to make headway thanks to their hard work and dedication to their jobs. Zoila supports her husband with their business, which consists of buying, selling and shipping first- and second-hand merchandise such as tools, lights, compressors, lamps, and other items to and from distinct parts of the country. Their customers are content with the products because Zoila's husband is also a mechanic, so he can assure that the products they sell are in good condition. They plan to use the loan to invest in shipping their products. They have not forgotten a time a while back when they had a sale and used all their funds to purchase merchandise and did not have anything left to pay for the shipping, which had to be delayed. \"It was a bad moment, but luckily we borrowed some money and did the business. In the end we felt relieved and we laughed,\" Zoila said.

It is comprised of 12 very hard-working members.  They are completing their third cycle together.  They demonstrate responsibility; union; and, above all, the expectation to improve the quality of life for themselves and their families.  The women have had a friendship for a very long time.  They are very dynamic in their work.  They sell bread, have a grocery store, sell food, and sell cosmetics.  Some work in their own homes, and others are street vendors.  As far as competition goes, it does exist in their neighborhood.

He lives with his wife and his 5-year-old grandson in the La Pava farming community, Mochum\u00ed district, which is an hour away from the city of Chiclayo.  For the past 6 years he has sold sacks of polvillo (a type of animal feed derived from rice).  He acquires his merchandise in Chiclayo's rice mills and sells it primarily to stores in Mochum\u00ed and among his neighbors who raise animals.  This is his only source of income with which he supports his family.  He has told us that he used to work in a mill before starting his current business but, due to his age, had to leave his job in the mill and seek new options with which to continue supporting his loved ones.  His customers' constant demands have motivated Manuel to buy more sacks of polvilo with which to enlarge his business.  For this reason, he is asking Edpyme Alternative for a loan of 1000 new soles to reach his goal. Manuel is hard-working and responsible.  His greatest wish is to continue growing as a merchant and to provide his family with the quality of life they need.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":421820,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase polvillo (an animal feed derived from rice).","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"La Pava -

some 15 minutes outside of the city of Cuenca, in the community of the same name to the south of the city. Thanks to its location, the area enjoys great natural beauty and biodiversity. Its adult population works in agriculture and ranching, while the young people work in the city or have migrated abroad to provide a better life for their families. \r\n\r\nLigia V., a member of the \"3 Mar\u00edas\" communal bank, lives near the highway to Punta Corral. She is 34 years old, married and the mother of four children, aged 16, 14, 12 and 10. Her oldest son studies at Unedid School, her second son at Miguel Merch\u00e1n School, her daughter at Herlinda Toral School, and her youngest child at the Yanuncay Educational Center. Her husband is a carpenter who traveled abroad many years ago to strive for a better present and future for his family. They do not yet have their own home, so they live at her mother's house. \r\n\r\nLigia has worked as a seamstress in her own shop for the past fifteen years. She offers alterations to every type of clothing, and she also sews blouses, skirts, and pants; but the garment she makes most often is the \"bolsicon,\" a traditional skirt worn by the women of Cuenca. She also raises chickens and pigs, both for her own household needs and to sell when her neighbors in the community ask for them, or when an economic emergency arises. \r\n\r\nShe has worked with the foundation for the past three years, and she tells us that the loans she has obtained have allowed her to carry out her work and to educate her children. With the loan provided to her by the Espoir Foundation, she will buy fabric to make bolsicones, blouses, skirts and pants for her regular customers. \r\n\r\nHer goal is to expand her business and eventually to build her own house.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman, Kiva

He lives with his wife in the Los Angeles sector of the city of Lambayeque about 15 minutes from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nFor two years he has worked in journalism. He began working as an announcer at a small local radio station. Then he worked with a companion who operated as a radio reporter and since then he has been building a career as a journalist on several local radio stations.\r\n\r\nHe comments proudly that now he has been able to advance to the position of coordinator at a small radio station in the district of Morrope. Since he has not had any type of formal education at the beginning of his career, he has started to study the career of journalism by correspondence.\r\n\r\nGerman is very hard working and is getting ahead for his family with a great effort. Before beginning to work as an announcer he made his living as a moto taxi driver. Now he continues to work using his vehicle during his free time.\r\n\r\nThe income that he receives allows him to maintain his family and build his house little by little. German wants to continue specializing in his profession and to be able to work with his own tools of the trade. For this reason he is requesting his first loan from Edpyme Alternativa, a credit of 500 new soles to buy a voice recorder and a second hand photograph camera to help with his work.\r\n\r\nHis greatest wish is to be able to obtain his academic degree in order to find a better position and finish building his house as well as provide his children the education they need.

Prior to being a fish vendor, he worked as a longshoreman in Bay\u00f3var (Piura).  While at that job, he noticed the intense activity of the local fish traders.  He was determined to learn about the business, which led to where he is today.  \r\n<p>\r\nCarmen acquires his inventory Monday through Friday at the local fishing terminals in the district of Santa Rosa.  On Saturday, he buys additional inventory at the terminal in Piura.   He then returns to his market stall to process the fish from Piura for drying.  The dried fish is salted the following day.  Carmen's vending business is the only source of income for his family.\r\n<p>\r\nHe is requesting his first loan from Edypme Alternativa in the amount of 500 soles.  The money will be used to buy more fish because the available supply during this time of the year is lower, so prices are more expensive.\r\n<p>\r\nCarmen is an honest and hardworking father.  He is well-known and respected among his colleagues.  He hopes to continue working as well as purchase a vehicle so that he can transport his goods more easily. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":422103,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase fish for processing & selling","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lambayeque","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2009-11-09T05:40:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":46.63},{"due_date":"2009-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":46.29},{"due_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":48.54},{"due_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":49.16},{"due_date":"2010-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":49.66},{"due_date":"2010-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":50.38},{"due_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":51.25},{"due_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":52.02},{"due_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":52.66},{"due_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":53.41}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.32},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.2},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.99},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.21},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.38},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.63},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.94},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.21},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.43},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.69}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":16.32,"local_amount":46.63,"processed_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:12:55Z","rounded_local_amount":47.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103780687,"comment":null},{"amount":16.2,"local_amount":46.29,"processed_date":"2009-12-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T12:48:08Z","rounded_local_amount":46.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110669589,"comment":null},{"amount":16.99,"local_amount":48.54,"processed_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T12:48:29Z","rounded_local_amount":49.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110669590,"comment":null},{"amount":17.21,"local_amount":49.16,"processed_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:15:59Z","rounded_local_amount":49.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118065094,"comment":null},{"amount":17.38,"local_amount":49.66,"processed_date":"2010-01-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:16:06Z","rounded_local_amount":50.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118065095,"comment":null},{"amount":35.57,"local_amount":101.63,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:47:24Z","rounded_local_amount":103.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123900199,"comment":null},{"amount":18.21,"local_amount":52.02,"processed_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:45:24Z","rounded_local_amount":52.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128934343,"comment":null},{"amount":18.43,"local_amount":52.66,"processed_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:45:33Z","rounded_local_amount":53.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128934344,"comment":null},{"amount":18.69,"local_amount":53.41,"processed_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:08:47Z","rounded_local_amount":54.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136661974,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-11-09T08:33:26Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T10:08:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":150498,"name":"Mercedes Magali","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mercedes tiene 28 a\u00f1os de edad, es casada y tiene dos hijos de 6 y 3 a\u00f1os de edad.

She wants to borrow a loan from KIVA lenders amounting to PHP 5,000 in order to buy stock of feed. Being a positive thinker, Maria believes that her loan will be granted.\r\n\r\nShe is happily married to Lorito, a carpenter. They are blessed with four children: Mylene, 25 years old; Rose Ann, 23 years old; Jennifer, 18 years old; and Juliet, 14 years old, a high school student. Their family happily lives at the village of Quezon, San Isidro.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":419953,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Additional

Creating tapestries is very enjoyable for Delia, since the work comes easily to her; it is cold working early in the morning, but the responsibility to fill her orders is her main motivation, and accordingly she has gained a reputation for being punctual in delivering her weavings. For this reason, she hopes to be recognized by the wholesale textile merchants and thus to make her business more dynamic. \r\n\r\nThis is her ninth loan with MFP, which she appreciates very much, and in turn, she feels highly committed to the payment schedule and the meetings of her communal bank. She will use the funds that she is currently requesting to purchase wool, thread and other supplies for her textiles. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":422598,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","use":"Purchasing textile supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-11-09T02:00:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Delia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":875}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":875,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2010-08-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:14Z","rounded_local_amount":2537.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166886512,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-11-09T03:10:43Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":150569,"name":"Leonora","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Leonora D.

Since she was very young she has used a loom to weave blankets and cloaks, and ultimately has found work weaving speciality fabrics for backpacks and purses, like those shown in the photo. For each fabric, she tries to harmonize the colors according to the tastes of her clients. However, thanks to her preferences it doesn't take much time for the fabrics to be sold and this makes her very happy. For the moment, she is a little sad because her feet hurt because of the excessive cold that they absorb while she weaves. Her town is in a zone that is very cold, but she works equally as hard as her husband, and they have therefore been able to put forward the money to be able to offer their children professional studies. This is her ninth loan with MFP, an affiliate of Kiva, and after all this time (4 years), she has come to lead her communal bank as the president of the board of directors.

Kumushay lives together with her family in the town of Tokmok. Kumushay's husband works as an electrician. Together they have raised three daughters. Their oldest and middle daughters are twenty nine and twenty six respectfully. They are both married. The youngest nineteen year old daughter lives with parents. Kumushay helps her husband to support the family the best she can. When she was still young, the relatives advised her to start doing animal husbandry. It's very convenient to run this business from home. When she got married Kumushay did not ignore this advice and had slowly bought some livestock. Right now Kumushay has two cows and two calves and sells the milk. All these years Kumushay had the opportunity to have a good income from milk sales and had also gradually increased the head count of cattle and sold it as was needed. Her youngest daughter and husband also help Kumushay to take care of the cattle after work. This is why Kumushay does not have any difficulties with her business. Kumushay is very worried about her youngest daughter's future. She is now studying at the university. She needs to pay the tuition fees. Kumushay and her husband alone cannot afford to pay the tuition and family's expenses at the same time. This is why Kumushay has decided to apply for a loan. But she does not want to take the loan and spend it all on the tuition. For the start, she wants to invest the loan money to buy a calf; after feeding it she will sell it and use the income to pay the tuition fees. This will allow her to save a great deal of money. Kumushay wants to buy a house in the same town in the future. \r\n\r\nKumushay's group partners are: Zuurakan, Nurbek and Jyldyz.\r\n\r\nZuurakan is forty four. Her husband works as a taxi driver. Zuurakan is a housewife, she keeps cows and sells milk. They have four children. Zuurakan has come for a loan to buy a milk cow.\r\n\r\nNurbek is forty three years old. Nurbek's wife sells food in the store. Nurbek himself keeps cattle and sells milk. They have four children. The youngest daughter is only four years old. Nurbek hopes to receive the loan and invest the money to buy calves.\r\n\r\nJyldyz is only twenty. But she is already running a big business. She has married early and took part in her husband's business \u2013 farming. At this time she milks eighteen cows daily and sells 50 litters of milk. Jyldyz hopes to receive the loan and invest the money in resale of large cattle.\r\n\r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

She is a widow and the mother of three children.  Mrs. I. can be proud of the way she and her late husband raised their three sons.  All three have chosen their paths in life and are working hard in their respective professions.  Mrs. I.'s oldest son moved to Russia and became a soldier.  He is 36 years old and is married.  Her middle son is 31.  He is also married and works in a tax office.  Her youngest son is 27.  He is single and works as a welder.  \r\n\r\nMrs. I. lives with her youngest son and takes care of the home and her livestock.  Her son always helps her.  Mrs. I. keeps dairy cows and sells their milk.  She had not done this before, however, her children knew their mother well.  As Mrs. I. has been a hardworking person her entire life, her children realized that when she retired, she would be restless just sitting at home.  So, five years ago, her sons collected some money and decided to make their mother happy by buying her some cows.  At that point, they hadn't imagined that Mrs. I. would be able to earn good money from the animals, in addition to providing food for herself.  Her sons spent 60,000 soms (1400 USD) to purchase the cows.  Now by selling the milk, Mrs. I. earns 7,400 soms (170 USD) a month.  The venture has turned out to be quite profitable and Mrs. I. would now like to expand her small business. She has applied for a loan to purchase feed for the animals during the winter. Soon she is planning to marry off her youngest son.\r\n\r\nMrs. I.'s partners in the group are Vera S., Valentina K., and Venera K..\r\n\r\nVera S. is 61 years old and is also a widow.  She is the mother of three children.  The children do not live with her.  Her oldest and youngest children, both sons, work in Russia, and her middle child, a daughter, works in Bishkek.  Mrs. S. keeps animals at home - a cow, chickens, and turkeys.  She needs a loan to purchase another cow.\r\n\r\nValentina K. is 62 and is also a widow.  Her only son is in Russia working as a driver.  Mrs. K. is retired.  She gets a pension of 2600 soms per month. Mrs. K. decided to apply for a loan to repair the roof of her home.\r\n\r\nVenera K. is 48 years old.  Her husband is a farmer.  Recently, she has been helping him.  Now they are planning to get into business reselling livestock.  Mrs. K. needs a loan in order to purchase two calves.\r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

She has one child and her husband works as a security guard in the Chui electric power plant. He gave Guljan freedom of choice to choose between working and staying at home and Guljan chose to work. Her relatives advised her to engage in farming.\r\n\r\nGuljan managed to obtain a three-hectare (7.5-acre) piece of land and made a start by investing $50 in buying clover seeds. So, for ten years she has been growing clover. As many people have cattle and need to prepare forage for winter, Guljan quickly started making profits. Now, she trades in clover at the market.\r\n\r\nGuljan\u2019s work has been a great asset to her family\u2019s budget as, together with her husband, she has been able to buy a house in Tokmok city. Recently, Guljan harvested the clover and now needs some funds for fertilizing and working the land before winter comes. Therefore, she has applied for this loan as she does not have much time to collect a sufficient amount of money.\r\n\r\nGuljan\u2019s partners are Gulzina, Dinara and Sabyrbek:\r\n\r\nGulzina, 23, is married and her husband works at a tannery. Gulzina works on her land: she has one-hectare (2.5 acres) of land and grows hay. She has already harvested and stacked the hay and now is preparing to start selling it. Gulzina hopes to get this loan and invest it in working the land and fertilizing it.\r\n\r\nDinara, 43, is divorced. She plans to get engaged in animal husbandry. Her colleagues have advised her to start this occupation as it brings good profits. Dinara has applied for this loan to purchase a calf. Now, she is planning to equip her house with the necessary facilities.\r\n\r\nSabyrbek, 46, is a father of four children. His wife works at Kyrgyz Post as a logistics manager. Sabyrbek trades in cattle at \u201cMurok\u201d market and manages to earn $185 a month. Now, he needs to obtain this loan to invest it in purchasing cattle.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>======================================\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---<\/b><p>\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.<p><p>\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of the 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable in order to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

She is 29 years old and a single mother of a 10 and a 3 years old, the older one goes to school. She finished 10th grade but couldn't keep studying because of her parent's financial situation. She lives in her own house with her children and does not support anyone else. \r\n\r\nShe owns a business and she's been working on it for 10 years, every day by herself from 7AM to 4PM. She mostly sells kitchen utensils and makes between 500MT and 1.000,00MT a day (U$15 and U$35). With that money she supports her kids and tries to save some. \r\n\r\nShe is asking for a 10.000,00MT loan (U$350) which she'll use to buy more inventory for her business (kitchen utensils and food products). She hopes to pay this loan without a problem so she can ask for another one in the future to finish building her house.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Mariana Dauwe, Kiva

And to help her husband in providing for their family, Glenda runs two businesses: her variety store and the vending of foods to her neighbors. These activities contribute to the income that they use in sustaining their daily expenses. Glenda hopes that through the revenue from her businesses, she can save for the future needs of their son, especially for his schooling.\r\n\r\nGlenda became a member of Kiva field partner Ahon sa Hirap Inc. (ASHI) in 2008 and every loan that she received was used in improving both of her businesses. Now, her 4th loan will be used as additional capital for her variety store. She will buy items that can sell, like sacks of rice, different soft drinks and different groceries. She is sure that after buying all of these, her business will gain more income for their family.\r\n\r\nThe dream of Glenda is that their child will finish his studies and also another child that they\u2019ll be going to have, given God\u2019s will. Another dream of Glenda\u2019s is to have their own house because right now they are living in the house of her husband\u2019s mother.

M. is 31 years old; she is 3 years older than her husband Joaquin M., who is now working as a welder. They have one daughter, Janna Marie, 5 years old. Aside from the revenue of her husband from being a welder, they also run a fishing business. They decided to start this kind of business because their house is near the sea, so it is very accessible for them. The business has been running for one year and a half and they work hard to make it so that it will run for long years ahead. Also Meriam manages a sewing business that contributes to their income.<P>\r\n\r\nWhen she joined Kiva field partner Ahon sa Hirap Inc. (ASHI), Meriam used her loan as capital to start the fishing business, but during typhoon Ondoy it was slightly damaged. So her 4th loan will be used again for this business, for its improvement. She will buy the things needed by her business such as various fishnets, accessories for the fishnets, fingerlings (small fish), and it will also be used for payment for a laborer. She is hoping that it will become more productive this time, and later on they can save so that she can buy her own sewing machine.<P>\r\n\r\nMeriam wants her child to finish her studies until college; that\u2019s another reason why they want to save. And also she wants to build a new house because like their fishing business, their house was also destroyed by the

To help her husband in providing for their family,Julieta runs a fishing business. She decided to start this business because all the resources are since they live in an island village of Sapang in the Philippines, and also because she wants to save for the future of her children.<P>\r\n\r\nBoth loans that she has received form Kiva field partner Ahon sa Hirap Inc. (ASHI) when she became a member has been used in improving this business. Now, her 3rd loan will be used in buying all the materials for making a fish cage, because their fish cage was damaged during Typhoon Ondoy. She will buy bamboo, fishnets and accessories for fishnets, different fingerlings (small fish) and also gasoline for the boat. She is hoping that with the help of this loan she can rebuild the fish cage that has been damaged and through its revenue they can add another fish cage for more income for them.<P>\r\n\r\nAs a mother, her first priority in life is their children; she wants them to finish their studies until college.

They happily live in the village located at Barangay Paniki, Bagabag, Nueva Vizcaya, with their five children. Despite the economic crisis, they aim to support the schooling of their children so that they will find a stable job someday. As a fruit of their patience and sacrifices, two of their children graduated from college while the others are still studying.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of their future, Erlinda and her husband till their land twice a year and plant palay (rice) and some vegetables. To earn additional income Erlinda ventured in the buying and selling of dry goods like blankets, towels and floor mats. She sells them in their village through retailing.\r\n\r\nRecognizing that the dry-goods business is really profitable, she now wants to acquire more dry goods but she has only a little capital. Thus, she wants to borrow additional capital of Php 10,000 from Kiva lenders to be used in acquiring the said products. She believes that the lenders will grant her requested loan.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":422628,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"To

is a 50-year-old widow with two children between 18 and 25 years old.  One of her children goes to school. She owns a one-room house where she is staying with two people. The family has access to electricity but no piped water. Yudaya takes care of additional family members. The family gets three meals a day.  She incurs additional transport costs to and from shopping in Owino market, one of the busiest markets in Uganda. She sells to all categories of people but mainly to schoolchildren because she resides near the school. Yudaya owns a canteen in Kawala selling all types of snacks like samosas, biscuits, fried groundnuts, pancakes and popcorn. Yudaya works seven days a week. On average, she receives 50 customers a day. Her business premise is her residence. Yudaya has been in this business for eight years and with MCDT for four years, servicing her eighth loan. She has worked all along with the same group mates. Her monthly expenses include school fees for her child and feeding the family. Yudaya wants to use this loan to buy more boxes of biscuits, cooking oil and wheat flour for frying chapatti and samosas. She hopes to see her business grow bigger and to employ three people to assist her.\t\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":422866,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

GHAPE instills a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its

D. is from the village of  Lumbayao , Valencia  City. He is 30 years old. Elmer is married and has 2 infant children. To make a living, Elmer owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector running a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. The main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food & daily use products in the local community. Elmer has been engaged in his business for over 4 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Elmer joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Elmer has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Elmer is requesting a new loan of 8000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by Elmer from HSPFI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to expand his business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

R. is from the village of Calaran, Calamba, Mis.Occ.. She is 45 years-old and married with two school-aged children. Esterlita owns and operates a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from being a \"sari-sari store\" or general store which sells a variety of products such as sugar, rice, canned goods, salt, etc. in the local community. Esterlita has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 7,000 PHP a month.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2009, Esterlita joined Kiva partner GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Esterlita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional goods for her sari- sari store. Esterlita is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional goods for her sari-sari store. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Esterlita from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support extended members of the her family. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n<p>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fishers and small entrepreneurs.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":422880,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

While not the only means of generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap, and toothpaste in the local community. Alicia has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2008, Alicia joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Alicia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. Alicia is requesting a new loan of 12,000 PHP which will be used to expand the business. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Alicia from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n<p>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

C. is from the village of Magcamiguing, Calamba, Misamis Occidental.

Emilda has been engaged in her business for over 15 years and earns approximately 4500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nEmilda joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Emilda is requesting a new loan of 3000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional fruits for sale. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Emilda from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units, with offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elmira, a 42-year-old woman, is the leader of this group. Elmira and her husband are raising three children. Their eldest son is 19.  He has already got on his feet and he lives and works in Bishkek. The middle son is a college student. And the little daughter goes to elementary school. Elmira and her husband always strive to give their children a good upbringing, so that their children grow up hardworking and diligent. To provide for the family and pay for the children\u2019s education, Elmira\u2019s husband works as a builder. As for Elmira, she manufactures traditional handicrafts. She wants to get herself a spot at the market and start selling the articles at the market. She got this idea after consulting her relatives, who believe in Elmira\u2019s skill and the profitability of this business. When Elmira first started sewing national articles, she invested 350$. Her expense was worth it, as in a very short time Elmira began receiving orders. Her success has encouraged her to expand her business and start selling the articles in a shop. Since then, she has been nurturing this idea in her soul and making preparations. Now everything is ready. She just needs some funds to purchase fabric. Therefore, Elmira has applied for this loan to start her business, steadily grow and become an independent entrepreneur. She also says that this business would let her give a better education to her daughter.\r\n\r\nElmira\u2019s partners are Batima, Cholponbai and Elnura.\r\n\r\nBatima, 46, is divorced. She is a mother of five children. Only her little daughter and son live with Batima. For a living, Batima sells potatoes. She hopes to obtain this loan and invest it in purchasing potatoes. \r\n\r\nCholponbai, 23, married very early and now has a six-year old son. His wife trades in socks at the market. Cholponbai trades in cattle. He needs a loan to invest in increasing the turnover.\r\n\r\nElnura, 25, is single. After graduating from college, Elnura decided to start trading in cattle. Now, she has a stable income and needs a loan to purchase calves.\r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of the 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

She manages her own sari-sari (general) store located at their house. On a monthly basis, she makes more than P10,000. She saves most of her profits to support the education of her children.\r\n \r\nIn 2007, Linda came to know about the Center for Community Transformation (CCT) Credit Cooperative and eventually became a member. She enjoys attending its weekly meetings for women entrepreneurs. Linda has applied for a new loan with the cooperative in the amount of P15,000 as additional capital for her store.\r\n\r\nLinda says she couldn\u2019t ask for more because all her children are responsible in their studies which gives her all the inspiration to work hard in her business. She is thinking of embarking on additional business ventures soon.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About CCT<\/b>\r\nThe Center for Community Transformation (CCT) is an organized Christian response against poverty and social injustice.

Begbuta works in agriculture and has always been efficient in his labors. He has been growing potatoes and onions for 10 years. He is 40 years old and married with four children. The role of father, which he has carried out for 15 years, has helped him to understand the sacrifice and hard labor of the women of the house. Now Begbuta wants to build a greenhouse but he lacks capital. He wants to borrow 3,500 somoni so he can buy potato and onion bags. He will also use part of the loan to construct a greenhouse. When the season ends, Begbuta wants to sell potatoes in bags for a good price. \r\n<p>\r\nThis request is in support of improving his living conditions and Begbuta is asking for help from your generous heart. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International:<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its epic mountain passes and its rich history which includes its place as a key post along the Silk Road and events at the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They are on their eighth collaboration with the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso with the goal of increasing their profits and meeting customer needs.  All the previous loans have been settled.  \r\n\r\nThe group members run diverse businesses, including selling onions, beauty products, and clothing for children.  With this new loan, they intend to buy 200 kg of onions, 30 boxes of beauty products, and 25 packets of children\u2019s clothing.  Supplies are gotten at the grand marketplace of Sikasso City, from Bamako, and from surrounding villages.  Sales are made in cash to customers composed of women and men at the grand marketplace of Sikasso City, at the house, and by going door-to-door.  \r\n\r\nThey each envision realizing an average monthly profit of 18,000 francs CFA.  A portion of the profits will be used to repay the loan, and the other portion will go into savings for covering health problems.  \r\n\r\nThe women of the group have the ambition to obtain a bigger loan for expanding their businesses.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":422951,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy various goods ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-11-09T22:30:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sanata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anchata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ramatou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-02T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":71428.57},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71428.57},{"due_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":71428.57},{"due_date":"2010-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":71428.57},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71428.57},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71428.57},{"due_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":71428.58}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":164.29},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":164.28},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":164.29},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":164.28},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":164.29},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":164.28},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":164.29}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":164.29,"local_amount":71428.57,"processed_date":"2009-12-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T17:02:21Z","rounded_local_amount":72221.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110763538,"comment":null},{"amount":164.28,"local_amount":71428.57,"processed_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:35:58Z","rounded_local_amount":72221.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118152354,"comment":null},{"amount":164.29,"local_amount":71428.57,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-01T09:12:47Z","rounded_local_amount":72221.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118152355,"comment":null},{"amount":164.28,"local_amount":71428.57,"processed_date":"2010-03-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:59:42Z","rounded_local_amount":72221.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129021474,"comment":null},{"amount":164.29,"local_amount":71428.57,"processed_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:14:49Z","rounded_local_amount":72221.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136746274,"comment":null},{"amount":164.28,"local_amount":71428.57,"processed_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:07Z","rounded_local_amount":72221.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144778836,"comment":null},{"amount":164.29,"local_amount":71428.58,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:43Z","rounded_local_amount":72221.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144778837,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-11-16T23:10:38Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":150764,"name":"Rose","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rose is 45 years old and married, with five children between 16 and 25 years of age.

On average, they are 48 years of age and have 6 children.  They live in the Bamanan Kin (Diamarabougou) neighborhood of Markala (4th administrative Region of the republic of Mali).  They know each other through bonds of neighborhood and of membership to the same traditional association of women of the neighborhood.  This association was formed by the NGO ROCAM II as part of their efforts to train in the dyeing of cloth, literacy, sanitation, etc.  These women of the Danaya group work selling various items and approached Soro Yiriwaso in the interest of satisfying the needs of their clientele.  After four successfully repaid loans, they are on their 5th group loan, which they plan to use to buy 10 pieces of wax for making batik cloth, 10 pieces of fabrics, six skeins of embroidery thread, 2 bags of sugar, 20 kg of ginger, 1 crate of lemons, 1 crate of tamarinds, 1 package of powdered baobab fruit, 1 package of powdered fruit juice, 1 package of flavored sodas and 68 loads of firewood.  They supply themselves in wax and in fabrics once a month in Bamako and occasionally in the big market of S\u00e9gou.  They buy sugar and ingredients for the preparation of local juices at the weekly market in Diamarabougou Markala and they buy firewood weekly at the market in Sarkala.  Their sales are made door-to-door or on foot, for cash and for credit to a clientele composed of women and men.  They hope to realize a monthly average profit of 71,000 FCFA that will serve to satisfy certain family expenses, cover their small personal needs, repay the loan and permit them to participate in social events.  Their ambitions are to have a means of transportation for the firewood and to save little by little in order to have a house of their own for themselves and their children.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Barbara (B) Brown, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1375,"image":{"id":422958,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy wax, fabrics, firewood, fruits, sugar, etc for resale ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Segou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14 -6","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-11-10T01:30:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Oumou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Mounina\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Lalla      Issa       ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":600000,"loan_amount":1375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2010-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2010-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2010-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":75000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":171.88},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":171.87},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":171.88},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":171.87},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":171.88},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":171.87},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":171.88},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":171.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":171.88,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2009-12-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T17:06:40Z","rounded_local_amount":75557.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110763541,"comment":null},{"amount":171.87,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-27T11:10:06Z","rounded_local_amount":75557.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118152360,"comment":null},{"amount":171.88,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-18T08:49:01Z","rounded_local_amount":75557.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123991207,"comment":null},{"amount":171.87,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-20T08:20:46Z","rounded_local_amount":75557.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129021477,"comment":null},{"amount":171.88,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2010-04-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:15:30Z","rounded_local_amount":75557.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136746277,"comment":null},{"amount":171.87,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:38Z","rounded_local_amount":75557.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144778842,"comment":null},{"amount":171.88,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2010-06-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:16:36Z","rounded_local_amount":75557.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151961094,"comment":null},{"amount":171.87,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2010-07-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:26Z","rounded_local_amount":75557.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159699288,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-11-10T19:48:43Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":150769,"name":"Djiguiss\u00e8m\u00e8 Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Le groupe Djiguiss\u00e8m\u00e8 est compos\u00e9 de huit femmes mari\u00e9es majoritairement dans des grandes familles polygames \u00e9largies avec en moyenne 42 ans, 5 enfants et habitant le quartier Service Kin (Diamarabougou) de Markala (4\u00e8me R\u00e9gion administrative  de la r\u00e9publique du Mali).\nElles se sont connues \u00e0 travers des liens de voisinage et d\u2019appartenance \u00e0 m\u00eame  association traditionnelle des femmes du quartier.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She enjoys a good deal of distinction and a large customer base.  Her selling power is due to her enthusiasm, especially her punctuality in fulfilling orders.  In addition to her tailoring trade, she dyes cloth.  \r\n\r\nConcerned about increasing her business capital in order to realize more profits, she turned toward Soro Yiriwaso.  She is on her first individual loan, which she intends to use to buy a CORNA brand sewing machine.  Her supplies are gotten locally.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

Very early on then, she began working in commerce with her mother for several years.  She has thus acquired solid experience in it.  And so, she decided to advance on her own by embracing commerce in second-hand clothing (outfits, footwear, brassieres, etc.) For three years, she has enjoyed a large customer base.  \r\n\r\nWith plans to increase her business capital, in order to realize more profits, she turned toward Soro Yiriwaso.  She has been associated with this micro-finance institution for 12 months.  After having properly repaid her first individual loan, she is now on her second loan, which she intends to use to buy five bales of used clothing.  Her supplies are gotten in Bamako and from Burkina Faso.  Sales are made in cash or on credit to customers composed of women and men.  \r\n\r\nWith this loan, she plans on realizing a monthly profit of 60,000 francs CFA.  This will enable her to clothe herself, to pay for kitchen utensils, and to help her husband to cover family expenses.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.
