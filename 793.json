In search of a source of funding for her family,  in 2006 Baktygul started her agriculture business with a starting sum of 10,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to Batygul's hard work, today her land holdings of 1 acre planted with potatoes bring in around 10,000-12,000 som (KGS) per month.  In addition, to cover daily family expenditures, Baktygul purchases scrap metal that she then turns in to a factory.  In order to further grow her business, Baktygul has turned to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 60,000 som (KGS) to purchase potato seeds.

She began learning commercial business when she was 16 years old and was working in stores to help out her widowed mother. So, three years ago when she thought of a way to earn money on her own, she had no doubts about opening her own business, also because at the same time she needed to take care of tasks in her own home.

He makes his sales for cash at a commercial location and also manages some credit accounts. His business is lively and has good profitability, so he wants to capture the attention of a new clientele, making a better display of his footwear, with new designs and in greater numbers than what he is usually accustomed to. This is the reason for his Kiva loan, the first financing that he has had from Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, with which he will buy footwear wholesale and for cash, assuring greater discounts which he will pass on to his customers, offering better prices.

Thanks to Kairykul\u2019s hard work, her farm, which now counts three calves and a cow, brings in about 13,000 KGS a month from the sales of milk as well as dairy and meat products. The revenues from her business allow Kairykul to pay for her son\u2019s law school studies. In order to grow her business further, Kairykul turned to \u201cBai Tushum & Parnters\u201d for a loan in the amount of 120,000 KGS in order to buy calves for fattening and later resale. Kairykul plans to invest her revenues into expanding her business.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1014740,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Karakol town","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-02-25T17:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-26T17:50:02Z","loan_amount":2575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kairykul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":120000,"loan_amount":2575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":30000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":643.75},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":643.75},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":643.75},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":643.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-02-25T22:15:25Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":396502,"name":"Jane's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jane's group is comprised of five hard-working women.

She is married to a businessman and has 2 children, aged 19 and 17 years.  They are both in school.  In 2004, Ejartu established her skirt, party dress, and under wear business. She began her business because her parents were against girl child education and at  6 years she was given to foster parents who likewise had no respect for female education.  They were mainly engaged in business.  After Ejartu was fully mature, she was handed in marriage to a businessman.  Her husband gave her some money to start her own business.  She now enjoys doing business and she has almost solved all her problems. \r\n\r\nWorking 7 days a week and 11 hours a day, she earns about Le 2,145,000 every month from this business. She would like a loan in the amount of Le 4,500,000.   Ejartu has already received and successfully repaid 2 loans.  Now she would like a new loan in order to purchase the following items: skirts - 2 bales @ Le1,450,000, party dresses - 1 bale @ Le1,100,000, and under vests - 10 dozen @ Le50,000. She hopes that this loan will enable her to increase her monthly profits by approximately Le 429,000.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Ejartu plans to build a house, educate her children to university level, which opportunity she did not have, and have a shop on her own.  She feels happy about taking this loan because it will help her business to grow.  Her major challenge is sometimes she buys a bale that contains spoiled clothing.  She serves 15 customers each day.  Her business is popular because she sells quality used clothing.  She is only assisted by her children.  Her suppliers are in Freetown and she transports her goods by public vehicle.  She buys twice in a month.  She uses the profit of the business to repay her loan.  She wants her business to expand and this will be accomplished by proper utilization of her capital.

She believes that her business is doing well because she provides good service to her customers.\r\n\r\nGisela is very grateful to Kiva lenders, and thanks to your help she can buy more merchandise and offer a wider variety of products to offer her customers.

and is raising a four year-old son. As a source of income for her family, Aizhan is engaged in animal husbandry and field crop cultivation.

Svetlana needs an additional 20,000 hrivnas to construct a greenhouse, purchase seeds and plastic film, and to prepare for the coming growing season. Svetlana has long dreamed of erecting an additional greenhouse, but she hasn't been able to find the funds for doing this. This year Svetlana purchased new arches for the new greenhouse. But now she needs money for installing them. Svetlana is divorced, and lives alone. But she is accustomed to doing everything herself. Right now she is building a new house, has installed gas in it, and recently purchased some land at the edge of the village, and plans to put up two more greenhouses eventually."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1015217,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to erect a greenhouse, puchase seeds and plastic film and prepare for the coming growing season.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UA","country":"Ukraine","town":"Blagoveschenka","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"49 32","type":"point"}},"partner_id":26,"posted_date":"2012-02-26T14:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-27T14:30:02Z","loan_amount":2500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Svetlana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UAH","disbursal_amount":20000,"loan_amount":2500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-02-26T21:14:02Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":394223,"name":"Llapallanchis Purisunchis Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La socia pertenece al banco comunal \u201cLLAPALLANCHIS PURISUNCHIS\u201d; El banco est\u00e1 ubicado en el distrito de San Jeronimo, perteneciente a la provincia de Cusco y departamento de Cusco. \n\n\nLa socia Sra.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nNormita operates a buy and sell business. What she basically does is to buy general merchandise from wholesalers and sell them with a small profit. Her products are clothes, sandals, bags and other such-like products. Customers are attracted to buy due to the low selling prices and the many options she offers. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 18,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy products and merchandise items to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nNormita hopes to be able to expand her business in the coming years.

She is single and does not have children. Currently, she is living in her parents' house, which is located in a rural village named Vallecito 15-8 belonging to the Tambogrande district in the province of Piura. Since it is a small village on the paths to progress, right now it only has basic electric energy services.\r\n\r\nAnabel, since she was very small, has been dedicated to raising animals. But since six years back, she has been dedicated to raising, fattening and selling sheep and poultry for which she travels to various neighboring villages to offer. She has the support of her family since her older sister participates in the loan by signing a commitment to pay the same. There exists a very good family relationship so they are always making new goals with which they can improve their quality of life.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Anabel is requesting a loan from Edpyme Alternativa for the amount of 1,800 new \"soles\" with which she wishes to buy balanced feed to fatten and grow her animals faster and to offer them at a better price.\r\n\r\nDespite being very young, she has demonstrated to be entrepreneurial and hard-working for the wellbeing of herself and her family."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1011941,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy balanced animal feed.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Tambogrande - Piura","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2012-02-26T15:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-27T15:10:04Z","loan_amount":675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Anabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1800,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":127.7},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":124.45},{"due_date":"2012-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":137.25},{"due_date":"2012-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":136.8},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":140},{"due_date":"2012-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":148.45},{"due_date":"2012-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":150.95},{"due_date":"2012-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":156},{"due_date":"2012-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":161.95},{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":167.2},{"due_date":"2013-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":172.2},{"due_date":"2013-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":177.05}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.89},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.47},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.3},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.66},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.61},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.5},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.73},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.7},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.39}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-02-26T17:02:41Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":396923,"name":"Lily","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lily is 26 years old single lady and supports three members of her family.

She is married to Rudy, her business partner, and a mother to her children. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.                             \r\n\r\nMaria Luisa operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP5 worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns income by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 300 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 12,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products to add to her inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMaria Luisa hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she dreams to be able to give her family a good future through all her hard work in her business.
