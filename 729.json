Sabirakhan works as a librarian in the main regional library in Bazarkorgon village and is known as a responsible and civilized person. After the Soviet Union fell apart and prices rose dramatically, Sabirakhan's salary was no longer enough to support her family. To make ends meet she began raising livestock and growing produce. Due to her diligent work and perseverance her household now has two cows and a big warm barn for all her animals. Sabirakhan also has a 1.2 acre plot of irrigated land where she grows cotton, tomatoes and other produce for sale. To further grow her farming business Sabirakhan has turned to \"Bai Tushum and partners\" for a loan of 130,000 som which she will use to purchase produce from other farmers for resale at her market stand. In the future Sabirakhan is planning to use the profits from the loan to build a second barn where she will store her produce over the winter.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":928246,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to broaden the assortment of goods","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kenesh village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2011-11-30T20:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2800,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sabirakhan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":130000,"loan_amount":2800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":65000},{"due_date":"2012-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":65000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1400},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1400}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2011-12-23T22:22:08Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":365249,"name":"Riverside Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Truphenah is the facilitator of the Riverside group.

Alina is a farmer in Vodyanoye village. She grows early tomatoes. Alina has six large greenhouses, where every year she plants 7000 tall tomatoes. She has been working in agriculture for eight years. She has invested about 150,000 hryvnia in her harm.

responsible women who all live in different places but the group members meet in Socorro\u2019s house because due to health issues she\u2019s unable to go out; she can\u2019t walk because the doctors have recommended that she rest for two months so the group members will meet in her house.  The place where she lives is on a little hill where every morning the sun arrives first, this is what Socorro relates.\r\n\r\nThe group is called \u201cEspuma de Mar\u201d (Sea Foam).  They chose this name because it occured to them and also because it\u2019s been used in other communal banks.  \r\n\r\nCaro, 28, is the group representative.  She\u2019s married to Gustavo who works as a cashier and they have two children: Jaime, 9, attending fourth grade in elementary school and Leslie, 4, in second grade of preschool.\r\n\r\nCaro raises chickens that she buys when they are little and then sells when they are big.  She comments that she\u2019s been in this business four years and has no great difficulty except when they become ill but if that happens Caro takes them to the veterinarian so there\u2019s no big problem.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion she\u2019s asked for the loan to buy 150 chicks, corn and feed.  Her goal for the chicks she\u2019ll soon buy is that they grow soon so that she can sell them within three months to help her husband with schooling and household expenses.  She also wants to save up some money so that when her husband is out of work they will still be able to eat.  She comments: \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult when my husband, Gustavo, isn\u2019t working because we don\u2019t have what\u2019s needed to cover our children\u2019s basic needs like food, shoes, school supplies.  That\u2019s why I and the other group members are very grateful for the loan we are being granted.  This is our first time and we don\u2019t intend to disappoint, especially me who as group representative must set the example.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe other group members will use the loan for other activities like:  Francisca, Juana and Socorro will buy chicks to raise and later sell; Maribel will buy underwear; Cinthya will invest in catalogue comforters and fragrances and finally, Brisa will invest in her bedspread and shoe business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1875,"image":{"id":918126,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy 150 chicks, feed and corn.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-11-30T01:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Brisa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cintia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maribel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Del Socorro","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ma Francisca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carolina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":26000,"loan_amount":1875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":3250},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3250},{"due_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":3250},{"due_date":"2011-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":3250},{"due_date":"2012-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":3250},{"due_date":"2012-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":3250},{"due_date":"2012-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":3250},{"due_date":"2012-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":3250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":234.38},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":234.37},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":234.37},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":234.38},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":234.37},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":234.38},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":234.37},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":234.38}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":937.5,"local_amount":13000,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:12:33Z","rounded_local_amount":13145.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250785118,"comment":null},{"amount":468.75,"local_amount":6500,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:27:59Z","rounded_local_amount":6572.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257193681,"comment":null},{"amount":468.75,"local_amount":6500,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:42:05Z","rounded_local_amount":6572.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263330042,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-11-30T17:42:27Z","paid_date":"2012-03-15T09:42:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":365405,"name":"Jenny Vanessa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Jenny es una mujer trabajadora y emprendedora quien se dedica a la venta de ropa, perfumes y cosm\u00e9ticos desde hace 13 a\u00f1os pero en los \u00faltimos seis a\u00f1os ha mantenido estable su negocio y ha crecido considerablemente.

All the members live in the same location where transportation is very scarce.  One has to walk several kilometers to reach the place where the group meets.  Only the special taxis go there but hardly anyone contracts this type of taxi because they are very expensive and they don\u2019t have enough money for them so they decide to walk.  They decided to call it Capilla San Juan because the place where the group meets is next to a chapel which is the most important one in the community and San Juan because that\u2019s the name of the community the chapel is located in.\n\nMagalena, 46, is group representative.  She\u2019s been married to Mart\u00edn for 29 years.  Four children were born to this couple and they are all still dependent.  Laura, 17, is no longer in school, Amalia, 15, is no longer in school either, Amancio, 12, who is in second year of secondary school and Anayeli, 9, who is in elementary school.\n\nMagdalena runs the school store where her daughter Anayeli attends which is why she was given this store.  She\u2019s been in business two years and the only difficulty she\u2019s had is that sales dropped very much when she was forbidden to sell sweets and junk food for the children.  This hurt sales because now children bring lunches from home and don\u2019t buy from Magdalena anymore.\n\nThis time she\u2019s asking for the loan to buy apples, oranges and one or the other sweet that she has been authorized to sell.  She also prepares meals but only for the teachers.\n\nHer goal is to manage to have another business where she can sell vegetables.  She and the group are grateful and they commented: \u201cThanks to the loan we\u2019ve been able to make our businesses grow and this has improved out quality of life.\u201d\n\nAll the group members will invest their loans differently.  Alejandro will invest in his taxi service; Gregoria, Paula, Mar\u00eda, Sof\u00eda and Juana will buy sheep; Ignacia in a store and in sheep; Antonia in a store and Guadalupe in clothes.\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3000,"image":{"id":918180,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy apples, oranges and candy.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-12-19T22:40:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alejandro ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gregoria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ignacia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Magdalena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paula ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Antonio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Porfiria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Guadalupe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sofia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":42000,"loan_amount":3000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":5250},{"due_date":"2011-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":5250},{"due_date":"2011-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":5250},{"due_date":"2011-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":5250},{"due_date":"2012-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":5250},{"due_date":"2012-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":5250},{"due_date":"2012-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":5250},{"due_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":5250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1500,"local_amount":21000,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:12:46Z","rounded_local_amount":21032.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250785119,"comment":null},{"amount":750,"local_amount":10500,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:28:14Z","rounded_local_amount":10516.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257193682,"comment":null},{"amount":750,"local_amount":10500,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:42:18Z","rounded_local_amount":10516.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263330043,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-12-20T05:59:19Z","paid_date":"2012-03-15T09:42:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":365408,"name":"Andrea","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Andrea es socia del Banco Comunal \u201cKapia Marca\u201d  ubicado en la provincia de Yunguyo y departamento de Puno, tiene 55 a\u00f1os de edad, est\u00e1 casada y  tiene dos hijos independientes.

She is also friendly and treats people kindly.  She lives with Jenix, who is a palm grower.  She only lives with her life partner as her children are grown and live independently.  However, they always visit her at her house.\r\n\r\nFlorinda\u2019s business is selling food; she sells as many breakfasts as her set menu items.  She has a restaurant in the number 2 market in the city of Pucallpa.  She started 30 years ago with her own capital.  First she had a stall at the market.  Then, with her effort and work, she managed to establish a place where she opened her restaurant.  She named it \u201cFlorita\u201d.  She has two helpers to wait on the customers.  She pays them at the weekly rate.\r\n\r\nWhat she likes about her business activity is being able to have a business that she can devote herself to and that keeps her busy.  She also likes the income that it generates to pay her household expenses.  On the other hand, what she does not like about her business activity is that the helpers get tired of working, and they take off pretty quickly.  She hopes to be able to count on stable helpers.  She also has plans to improve the ambience of her place in order to provide the customers with better service.\r\n\r\nThis will be her sixth loan with the MFP institution.  Therefore she hopes for your collaboration in order to continue with her objectives.  She also says that she feels good with her communal bank as she considers the members to be good people.\r\n\r\nShe will use the requested 1,000 soles to buy paint to paint the walls and to buy new chairs.

She receives orders on a daily basis and then returns home in the evenings in time for dinner.  Reynalda says that her business produces a wide variety of products such as croissants, sweet breads, empanadas, sweet rolls, sandwich buns, sponge cakes, ciabatta bread, cream puffs, and many other items. She is requesting a loan from the microfinance institution so that she can buy materials at wholesale such as flour, sugar, milk, eggs, flavorings, firewood, and gas in order to make her delicious breads.

Anastacio works as a merchant.\r\n\r\n\r\nMarisol knits things like vests, sweaters, and also sews napkins and tablecloths.  This time she is asking for this loan to buy knitting needles, thread, sewing needles, adornments, and accessories.\r\n\r\n\r\nHer challenge is that there are days where she doesn\u2019t have enough money to fill all of her pending orders, so many times she has to backorder them.  It\u2019s also difficult for her to find the raw materials at good prices.  She prefers buying her products in quantity because they\u2019re less expensive.  One of her goals is to have a shop where she can show her embroidery and knitting.  She would also like to teach other people to knit and embroider.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll of the members are very happy and grateful and say, \u201cThanks to the loans, we are able to invest into our businesses.  I, Margarita, will buy toys to resell; I, Talalia will buy beauty products; I Maridalia will buy gloves, hats, and scarves for the cold season; I, Karina will invest in a grocery store; and I, Alicia will invest in chickens.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1300,"image":{"id":920578,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","use":"to buy supplies for needlework.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-12-01T04:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marisol","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Karina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Natalia Reyna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maridalia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alicia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":18000,"loan_amount":1300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2011-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2011-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2011-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2012-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2012-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2012-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2012-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":2250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":650,"local_amount":9000,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:12:57Z","rounded_local_amount":9114.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250785139,"comment":null},{"amount":325,"local_amount":4500,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:28:24Z","rounded_local_amount":4557.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257193702,"comment":null},{"amount":325,"local_amount":4500,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:42:28Z","rounded_local_amount":4557.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263330063,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-12-01T21:31:32Z","paid_date":"2012-03-15T09:42:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":365461,"name":"La Iniciativa Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Este Grupo solidario se llama La Iniciativa, est\u00e1 conformado por la se\u00f1ora Fortunata va a comprar con su pr\u00e9stamo alimento para puerco, la se\u00f1ora Paula va a comprar ropa de dama, caballero y ni\u00f1os, la se\u00f1ora Ver\u00f3nica va a comprar agua por garrafones, la se\u00f1ora Florencia va a comprar chocolates, chicles, paletas, chicharrones, etc. La se\u00f1ora Maira Elizet va a comprar zapatos para dama y caballeros, la se\u00f1ora Herminia va a comprar puercos.

All\u00ed tiene un negocio a trav\u00e9s del cual ofrece servicios de hospedaje, aprovechando la oportunidad del estacionamiento que hacen los conductores de cargas pesadas, para descansar y continuar su camino por las carreteras de Colombia. En este municipio donde hay muy pocos hospedajes  y muchas veces los transportadores,  deben quedarse en los parqueaderos donde est\u00e1n estacionados, Javier cuenta con un familiar muy especial que es el mayor promotor de este negocio, pues como cuida los camiones en un estacionamiento, recomienda los servicios de este hospedaje. Su necesidad de financiamiento est\u00e1 basada en que son pocos muy pocos los hospedajes que hay en el pueblo y esto  genera que   permanezcan colmados y con el cupo completo y los potenciales hu\u00e9spedes pasen mucho trabajo al llegar al municipio. Esta es la raz\u00f3n por la cual Javier acude a su credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, con el cual  acondicionar\u00e1 habitaciones para aumentar el servicio, adecuar\u00e1 cuartos de ba\u00f1o, pintar\u00e1 y  embaldosar\u00e1 estas habitaciones.

He lives in the town of San Jacinto in the department of Bol\u00edvar, a land of traditional vertical-woven  handicrafts, shoulder bags, and hammocks made by the women, who have passed the trade down from generation to generation. Javier has an inn where travelers with heavy loads can avail themselves of the opportunity to rest before continuing along Colombia's roadways. In this town, where there are very few inns and truckers often need to stay where their vehicles are parked, Javier has a very special relative who is the primary promoter of Javier's line of business; he looks after the trucks in the lots, and recommends people to the inn. \r\n\r\nJavier needs financing because there are so few inns in town that they're always full, so it's a big problem when potential guests come to town. He's seeking a loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo so he can air-condition the rooms for better service, and paint and tile the bathrooms to bring them up to snuff. The investment will be a success because he's doing it in response to his clientele's growing need during the end of the year, when more heavy-load truckers are passing through San Jacinto.  The are also tourists and Javier doesn't want to miss out on the developing tourism industry in his region.

Hern\u00e1ndez: the group has this name because it was chosen by Guadalupe because only members of the Hernandez family participate, such as her husband Hilario and her daughter in law Irma. This is the first time they are on the loan.  \n\nThey work as merchants. Guadalupe is the group's representative. She is 60 year old and has been in a common law marriage with Hilario for 33 years. Hilario works in the fields.  \n \nThe three will invest in their businesses, a grocery store and paper store. These are family businesses. Irma attends to the store. Her husband started the business but she is the one who is in charge of it. She has been doing this for three months, but the business is already 30 years old. Guadalupe and Hilario run it.\n\nThis time, Guadalupe has taken out the loan to buy everything she needs for the business, such as detergent, milk, bread, eggs, canned goods, drinks, rice, and seeds. Irma will invest in her paper store such as backpacks and notebooks, which is what is most needed at this time.  \n\nGuadalupe's challenge is that there is a lot of competition. A lot of stores have been opened nearby and because of that her sales have gone down considerably, since before she made double or triple what she makes now. Nonetheless, one of her goals is to have a well stocked store again, since a lot of store close quickly, but she has always liked having her store. She would also like to enlarge it a little.  \n\nThey are very grateful for the loan. Guadalupe remarks: \u201cI am very happy with the opportunity that has been given me, since without your help I would never have been able to lift the business up, because I didn't have the money to buy what my store needed. For us it has been very difficult to get money, since my husband makes very little, and the earnings from the store are to make more.\u201d \n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1001.76,"image":{"id":927570,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy bread, milk, eggs, drinks, and canned goods.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-12-19T22:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Guadalupe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irma ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hilario","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":15000,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":857.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":867.59},{"due_date":"2011-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":877.8},{"due_date":"2011-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":888.13},{"due_date":"2011-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":898.58},{"due_date":"2011-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":909.16},{"due_date":"2012-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":919.86},{"due_date":"2012-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":930.68},{"due_date":"2012-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":941.63},{"due_date":"2012-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":952.72},{"due_date":"2012-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":963.93},{"due_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":975.27},{"due_date":"2012-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":986.75},{"due_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":998.36},{"due_date":"2012-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1010.11},{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1021.93}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.45},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.18},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.91},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.65},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.4},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.15},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.93},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.7},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.48},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.28},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.08},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.89},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.72},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.55},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.39},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.24}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":445.67,"local_amount":6218.62,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:13:00Z","rounded_local_amount":6248.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250785152,"comment":null},{"amount":271.54,"local_amount":3788.96,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:28:14Z","rounded_local_amount":3807.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257193714,"comment":null},{"amount":284.55,"local_amount":3970.49,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:42:19Z","rounded_local_amount":3989.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263330075,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-12-20T09:24:35Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":365503,"name":"Jade Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Los integrantes del grupo siguen en su actividad que vienen desarrollando.

They chose the group's name because almost all of them are artisans who make crafts like embroidery and knitting - so they called themselves Artesanas [artisans], and Fresno is the name of their community. \r\n\r\nMaria Juana is an older woman who is very familiar with the origins of embroidery and knitting in the community. She is 69, widowed and lives alone but very close to her children and she spends most of the day with her grandchildren. Maria Juana says that the wool used to all be natural, but now it's synthetic. They used to make it themselves, first washing the lambswool then making linen with the well-washed wool. They used a wooden instrument to obtain the wool. Afterwards they knitted all of their wool threads until they had fabric, and finally they dyed the fabric - the most common colors were black, brown and gray. Things have changed now and none of this is done the same way because the fabrics are of very bad quality.\r\n\r\nShe has been doing embroidery for 30 years, since her children were young. She says that it helped her to put them through school and also with their household costs when her husband was unemployed. She used to sell her embroidery every Monday in Ixtlahuaca, but now she only offers them to people she knows in her community. She is alone and often can't cover the costs of her basic necessities like food, clothing and shoes, which is why she works. This time she has asked for a loan to buy colored wool, fabric and needles. \r\n\r\nHer challenge is that her work is not as valued as it used to be and people don't want to pay a fair price. She says that it's very old-fashioned and it takes many days to finish a piece of work because everything is done by hand. She makes vests, bags, blankets, and sweaters with local figures like parrots, stars, flowers, etc.\r\n\r\nOne of Juana's goals is to sell more embroidery so she can buy corn, because if she doesn't, she won't have corn to make her tortillas all year, which is one of the foods she eats every day. \r\n\r\nAll of the members of the group are very thankful for the loan because they can buy the materials that they lack and meet their back orders. Angelina, Leonila, Lucia, Gregoria, Rufina, Rosio and Maria Lucina will invest in embroidery; Maria de los Angeles and Juana Iriais will invest in cosmetics.

He drives one of the cars himself and hires the other one out (he does the same with the motorcycle taxi).  In this way, he makes several incomes.  What Jairo enjoys about his work is the income that it makes and the fact that it allows him to cover his household expenses and his children's education expenses.  On the contrary, what he does not enjoy about his work is the stress and the eye strain which he suffers from because he spends so many hours at the wheel, driving his car.

Her two children, Roc\u00edo and Anderson, are the inspiration for her work. She lives in her parents\u2019 house in the district of Palcamayo, along with her partner and two children. She learned to work the earth when she was a child. In her community, she has her own lands where she cultivates peas, spinach, carrots, and lettuce, etc. Since Juana is not satisfied with this production, she also rents other plots so she can raise more produce. In this way, she markets a wide variety of vegetables, which she sells with satisfaction at the wholesale market. \u201cThe vegetables from Tarma are in demand in Lima, and the buyers take them away in bags and baskets,\u201d she says. As her business is profitable, she also buys and sells vegetables and tubers, since she has well-known customers in the capital city who request a variety of products from her. Juana plans to finish building her own home, which is something she has worked hard for and persevered on a daily basis with her business to attain. In the future, she will furnish her home with furniture and appliances that she will purchase little by little. Juana has requested an individual loan from MFP [Microfinanzas Prisma] because she feels the organization has helped her in decisive moments with her business. She is committed to make her payments on time. By receiving this help, this hard-working woman will be able to put a roof on her house. To do so, she will purchase cement and will hire workers to help her with this project. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":76.31,"image":{"id":933772,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"To purchase cement and hire workers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-12-02T05:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":63.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":68.66},{"due_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":71.5},{"due_date":"2012-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":76.61},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":77.63},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":81.71},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":83.46},{"due_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":88.96},{"due_date":"2012-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":91.35},{"due_date":"2012-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":95.13},{"due_date":"2012-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":99.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":102.33}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.75},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.75},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.81},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.73},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.11},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.64},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.3},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.36},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.25},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.68},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.25},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":23.75,"local_amount":63.33,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:50:53Z","rounded_local_amount":64.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250836235,"comment":null},{"amount":25.75,"local_amount":68.66,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:19:27Z","rounded_local_amount":69.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245998,"comment":null},{"amount":26.81,"local_amount":71.5,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:30:44Z","rounded_local_amount":72.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263386021,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-12-16T16:25:54Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":365567,"name":"Matilde De Jesus","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Matilde, es un joven de 24 a\u00f1os, soltero, nacido en la comarca el Coyolito  ubicada en la Concordia municipio de Jinotega, el se dedica a la siembra de hortalizas.

This sentence characterizes Galia because, despite the fact that her husband has a secure and profitable job, she doesn't get left behind and also works tenaciously.  Galia currently works selling dairy products such as Oxapampa cheeses, natural yoghurt, curds, etc.  In order to acquire these products, she travels every two weeks to the city of Oxapampa.  \"The cheese business is profitable.  For example, I buy every kilo for 8 soles and sell it for 15 soles\", she says.\r\n\r\nGalia's customers already know her.  They are mainly friends, and mothers of pupils who attend her children's school, who recommend her to other buyers.  For this reason, she always has orders year round.

Her youngest daughter is only three years old. As many other families in the countryside Burulkan raises cattle with her husband, a business which the two started more then 20 years ago. Currently their herd includes 2 milk cows and 10 sheep, and they earn a monthly profit of 5,000 som (KGS) from the sale of milk, dairy products and meat. They also own a 1.2 acre plot of irrigated land where they grow corn and wheat for animal feed. In order to expand her business, Burulkan has turned to \"Bai Tushum and partners\" for a loan of 135,000 som (KGS) which she will use to buy more cattle for meat production and resale. The profits from the loan Burulkan is planning to invest in her farm business. She is dreaming of be able to buy a car for her family in the future.
