She is a widow and mother of five children; three are studying, and the eldest is working while the youngest is still at home. By the grace of God, she has managed to support her children's schooling up to college level. This is a dream for most poor Filipino parents like Elvira, who believe that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents could leave to their children.\r\n\r\nElvira operates a food and barbeque stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals on evenings when all of the family members are at home to take part of the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons, when buying cooked rice and viands (food items) cost less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippines pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 12,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments, and seasonings. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nElvira dreams for her children to find a stable job after finishing college and also for her business to grow more. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and also to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

is Flora, 44, a resident of Quezon City, Philippines. She is a single parent to a high school student. She manages her household while operating her business. She works hard to meet her family\u2019s daily needs and expenses.\r\n\r\nFlora operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings where all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition, but also a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons, when buying cooked rice and other foods cost less than raw food. \r\n\r\nFlora also retails electronic cell phone loads (prepaid cell phone credits) and operates a small variety store. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 1,200 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan of PHP 15, 000 that will help her continue her business.  She will be using the loan to buy raw meat, vegetables, and other products that will help her to meet the demands of her numerous customers. Her profits will definitely help her to sustain her family\u2019s daily needs and her child\u2019s educational expenses.  \r\n\r\nFlora dreams that her business will continue to grow. She wants her child to finish studies and be able to have a comfortable life someday.

She hopes that her vending activity will be more profitable, allowing her to support her children until they finish their studies. \r\n\r\nOne major challenge to Josephine is that she suffers from a shortage of income nowadays due to the increase in the prices of basic commodities. Another challenge is paying the allowance of her children and the house rent. \r\n\r\nFor these reasons, Josephine would like to ask for an additional capital amount of PHP25,000, allowing her to buy a stock of bananas and spices for her retailing business. She hopes that she will obtain the loan amount in order to improve the family's living conditions."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":900875,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

is 45 years old and married with three children. To generate income, he works as a farmer in the Philippines, planting rice in their field. He can suffer with the heat of the sun, or the cold under the rain, just to take care of his crops in the field in order to feed his family.\r\n\r\nHe is proud to be a farmer. He has been running a rice field business for almost 21 years. Eduardo practices farming in order to provide the needs of his family.

39, is a resident of Quezon City, Philippines. She is married to Roger, who is self-employed. She is a mother of five children, two are now in high school, one in elementary and two are not yet of school age. She\u2019s doing business while attending to the needs of her family. This is her way of helping her husband with their daily expenses.\r\n\r\nAna owns a variety store selling groceries like canned goods, condiments, milk, sugar, primary commodities that are needed in every household. She earns money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. She also does some tailoring and repairs as an additional source of income. Her regular customers are her neighbors in the local community.  She earns 550 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 24,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy more groceries that will accommodate the demands of her customers. She believes that having more display items will definitely attract more customers which means more profit. She will save her profit for the educational expenses of her children.  \r\n\r\nAna hopes that her variety store will soon become a full-scale grocery. She dreams all her children will be able to finish their studies and strives hard to meet the huge amount of their daily expenses.

Currently Urumbek, with the assistance of his son, is gathering all his crops. \r\n\r\nHe plans to sell some part of it now, and to save the rest for spring. The later sale will bring him a lot of extra income. The proof of financial success was a purchase of a long-waited automobile, which has made the transportation of products easier. \r\n\r\nA monthly income from harvest is 5 000 soms. Urumbek earns a supplementary income by working in various types of construction.

district. Untiring efforts, strong management skills and patience helped her to attain this status. Being born in a typical farming family, Ainura used to help her father in land cultivation and cattle breeding. \r\n\r\nTen years ago, she took full control of livestock left as a family heritage and since then has never looked back. \r\n\r\nAinura invested 15,000 KGS in a purchase of young calves. Step by step she expanded her activities with expected returns and soon saw good economic gains from cattle reselling. Today she is a proud owner of one of the largest households in the district. \r\n\r\nAinura\u2019s next step in business promotion is dairy. She plans to distribute the generated milk products to local customers. Ainura hopes that the loan from Kiva lenders will allow her buy her first cow for the new business start-up. \r\n\r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused microfinance institution in Kyrgyzstan.

She is married and has three children.  Her husband is a carpenter, and, in order to help her husband, Gulchehra got involved in sales 18 years ago.  She sells fresh vegetables and fruits, such as apples, grapes, pomegranates, cucumbers, tomatoes, etc.  This business provides her with a good income.

He has been doing this work for several years now and thanks to it he is able to pay for his family's expenses.\r\n\r\nHe wants to do maintenance on his truck by changing some parts and the tires because it has been having mechanical problems.  Because he will be able to offer his customers better service with his car in good condition, he thought it would be a good idea to ask for his first loan from Edpyme Alternativa for 2,000 nuevos soles.  Jos\u00e9 is well known and respected by his coworkers who consider him to be a responsible person with the drive to keep moving forward to help his family financially.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":277.48,"image":{"id":901304,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"to

He is used by taxi drivers and private vehicle owners who have him carry out their weekly clean.  Before he had this business, he was a driver of private vehicles.  He did this work for more than 30 years and knows how to maintain and clean cars.  For this reason, his customers seek him out to request his services.  He has had this business for two years and he set it up because he didn't have a job and, above all, because he still has one child to support who wants to become a professional, like his siblings.  For this reason, Francisco looked for a way to support his family in an honest and decent manner.\r\n\r\nFrancisco needs this loan to buy a vacuum cleaner, hose, disinfectants, soaps, towels and aromatic sprays to clean and wax cars.  These are some of the cleaning tools that he needs to provide his customers with a better service.  He would like to be able to have better infrastructure in his business, painting it and laying some flooring, so that it can be more attractive to his customers and help him to get ahead in life."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":144.46,"image":{"id":901362,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"to buy a vacuum cleaner, hose, disinfectants, soaps, towels and aromatic sprays for cleaning and waxing cars","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2011-10-22T12:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Francisco Ramon ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":307.64,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":34.2},{"due_date":"2011-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":34.18},{"due_date":"2012-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":34.18},{"due_date":"2012-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":34.18},{"due_date":"2012-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":34.18},{"due_date":"2012-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":34.18},{"due_date":"2012-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":34.18},{"due_date":"2012-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":34.18},{"due_date":"2012-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":34.18}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.13},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.1},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.11}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":36.13,"local_amount":34.2,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-16T09:04:08Z","rounded_local_amount":36.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244770106,"comment":null},{"amount":36.11,"local_amount":34.18,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:47:26Z","rounded_local_amount":36.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250832670,"comment":null},{"amount":36.11,"local_amount":34.18,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:15:57Z","rounded_local_amount":36.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257242589,"comment":null},{"amount":36.11,"local_amount":34.18,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:27:51Z","rounded_local_amount":36.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263381863,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-11-22T18:37:48Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":349975,"name":"Ricardo  Jose","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ricardo tiene la edad de 37 a\u00f1os, con su propio negocio, una vulcanizacion con un a\u00f1o de trabajarla, pues anteriormente, tenia negocio de billar, pero no tenia  ganancias, lo que toma la decision de cambiar totalmente, para lograr recuperar la inversion perdida.

They live in Pampahasi which is located 20 minutes from the city centre of La Paz. His youngest son, who is still a minor, works as a driver for the local union. Sr. Profirio is a cobbler and makes boots and ankle boots for women in a small workshop he has at home. Don Porfirio used to work at a factory where he learned to make these shoes and he has had his own workshop for several years now. At the moment, Don Porfirio does not have a skiver machine which helps to bevel the leather at the edges so that it is easier to handle when making the seams. This is why he is asking for a loan in order to buy a skiver machine. One of his greatest desires is to expand his workshop and be able to increase his income.\r\n \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":367.3,"image":{"id":901385,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cobbler","sector":"Services","use":"to buy a skiver machine.\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.5 -68.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2011-10-22T13:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Porfirio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":74.2},{"due_date":"2011-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":70.54},{"due_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":72.07},{"due_date":"2012-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":72.84},{"due_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":77.65},{"due_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":81.45},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":82.36},{"due_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":87.55},{"due_date":"2012-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":89.83},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":93.4},{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":97.38},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":100.73}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.2},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.54},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.07},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.84},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.65},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.45},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.36},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.55},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.83},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.4},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.38},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.73}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":144.74,"local_amount":144.74,"processed_date":"2011-11-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:45:22Z","rounded_local_amount":144.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244545792,"comment":null},{"amount":72.07,"local_amount":72.07,"processed_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:51:33Z","rounded_local_amount":72.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250756063,"comment":null},{"amount":72.84,"local_amount":72.84,"processed_date":"2012-01-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:01:11Z","rounded_local_amount":72.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257163182,"comment":null},{"amount":77.65,"local_amount":77.65,"processed_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:16:08Z","rounded_local_amount":77.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263294724,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-11-23T10:27:32Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":349979,"name":"Kelin Jahayra","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Kelin de 26 a\u00f1os de edad,  vive en una zona perif\u00e9rica de San Pedro Sula.

She buys her materials from a distributor that specializes in hair products.  \r\n \r\nWith the loan, she will buy construction materials to enlarge her house and set up her hair salon. She remarks that setting up her business in an established locale will be cementing one of her goals. \r\n \r\nRuth lives with her husband and her 7 year old son. Her personal dreams are to study psychology and for that she has to take the University Selection Exam ( the PSU). She is very happy and grateful for the loan and services given by the Fondo Esperanza. She also feels very comfortable with the communal bank she belongs to since they are very united and there is trust and respect, despite the differences in age and interests in the group.     \r\n\r\nTemuco is the capital of the Araucan\u00eda region. The is located 670 kilometers south of Santiago (the capital of Chile). Nearby is a series of lake beaches (Puc\u00f3n, Villarrica) and striking native flora and fauna in its nature parks. It is worth noting that this region has 50% of the country's Mapuche population, an indigenous people. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3275,"image":{"id":901265,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","use":"to buy construction to enlarge her house and set up a locale for a hair salon.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CL","country":"Chile","town":"Temuco","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-30 -71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":157,"posted_date":"2011-10-22T15:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ruth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Alejandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Olivia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Raiza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Miriam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Belinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ruth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ivon","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ingrid","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"M\u00f3nica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CLP","disbursal_amount":1693386,"loan_amount":3275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":102646},{"due_date":"2011-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":119504},{"due_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":116301},{"due_date":"2011-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":117409},{"due_date":"2011-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":118538},{"due_date":"2011-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":119669},{"due_date":"2011-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":120810},{"due_date":"2011-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":121964},{"due_date":"2011-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":123126},{"due_date":"2012-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":124301},{"due_date":"2012-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":125490},{"due_date":"2012-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":126679},{"due_date":"2012-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":127887},{"due_date":"2012-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":129062}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":198.52},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":231.12},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":224.92},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":227.07},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":229.25},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":231.44},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":233.65},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":235.88},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":238.12},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":240.4},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":242.7},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":244.99},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":247.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":249.61}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1110.88,"local_amount":574398,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:50:14Z","rounded_local_amount":575992.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244561323,"comment":null},{"amount":939.09,"local_amount":485569,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:00:46Z","rounded_local_amount":486917.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250772318,"comment":null},{"amount":1225.03,"local_amount":633419,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:13:53Z","rounded_local_amount":635177.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257180765,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-10-25T20:56:17Z","paid_date":"2012-02-15T10:13:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":350000,"name":"Sara","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Sara tiene 55 a\u00f1os, es una mujer alegre y so\u00f1adora, le gusta mucho trabajar y estar activa.

For this reason, she decided to prepare them herself and offer them to her neighbors, friends and family members.  Her business is doing very well and she has a lot of orders.  She is now delivering orders to companies that request her products in bulk.\n\nMar\u00eda will use the loan that she obtained to fit out a space in her home where she would like to sell her tamales as well as beauty products.  She would like to take advantage of the fact that her home is opposite a school with a lot of street traffic. Mar\u00eda hopes to achieve her goals with a lot of work and sacrifice.\n\n* In the photo, Mar\u00eda is seated and wearing a white top."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2900,"image":{"id":901451,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to set up a place in her home for her tamale store ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Puente Piedra","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.870278 -77.086111","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2011-11-11T16:40:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2900,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Maria Antolina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Estela Guadalupe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Celestina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Juliana Miguelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Olinda Geronima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Rogelia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nolasco","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Antonia Luz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Violeta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Johnny Alexander","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Juan David","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":7850,"loan_amount":2900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1963},{"due_date":"2011-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1963},{"due_date":"2012-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1963},{"due_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1961}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":725.18},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":725.19},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":725.18},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":724.45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":725.18,"local_amount":1963,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:40:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1975.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244540703,"comment":null},{"amount":725.19,"local_amount":1963,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:48:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1975.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250751379,"comment":null},{"amount":725.18,"local_amount":1963,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:57:18Z","rounded_local_amount":1975.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257158649,"comment":null},{"amount":724.45,"local_amount":1961,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:08:06Z","rounded_local_amount":1973.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263288817,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-11-16T09:52:31Z","paid_date":"2012-03-15T09:08:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":350011,"name":"Andrea","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Andrea  es socia del Banco Comunal \u201cSanta Rosa D.
