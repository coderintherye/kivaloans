Vanna is married to Mr. Vanara Soun, who is 33 years old. The couple has one child. Her husband makes a living repairing TVs, radios and cassette players.

Their clientele is composed essentially of women and people who are keen on these traditional Malian handicrafts. <P>\r\n\r\nWith their earnings, they expect to make payments on the loan and help support their families. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1575,"image":{"id":217526,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":"buying raw materials (leather, palm fronds, calabashes etc.)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"KOUTIALA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.383333 -5.466667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2008-11-01T07:00:51Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Awa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ma\u00efmouna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sitan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rokia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Korotimi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sanata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Haby","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Minata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-15T19:38:49Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":800000,"loan_amount":1575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":262.5,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2008-12-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:29:22Z","rounded_local_amount":134837.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9974046,"comment":null},{"amount":262.5,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2009-01-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:28:21Z","rounded_local_amount":134837.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14889419,"comment":null},{"amount":262.5,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2009-02-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:13:17Z","rounded_local_amount":134837.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20440212,"comment":null},{"amount":262.5,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2009-03-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:09:35Z","rounded_local_amount":134837.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135580,"comment":null},{"amount":262.49,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:30:08Z","rounded_local_amount":134837.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033381,"comment":null},{"amount":262.51,"local_amount":133333.35,"processed_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:40:43Z","rounded_local_amount":134837.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44620783,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-11-01T18:38:49Z","paid_date":"2009-06-16T02:40:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":71282,"name":"Zorica","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Zorica was born in 1971 and lives in Karanovac, a village in Bosnia outside of Petrovo.

The group members all do the same work (making and selling soumbala).  In addition, they have other work, such as knitting. \r\n<p>\r\nThe current loan will be used to buy sacks of n\u00e9r\u00e9 nuts.  Next, the nuts are boiled and pounded to obtain a dark paste, which is made into various shapes (balls or ovals).  The product is taken to the  marketplaces in Koutiala and in Bamako (capital of Mali).\r\n<p>\r\nThe group members intend to realize an average profit of 125,000 francs CFA for the duration of the loan.  A large portion of the profits will serve to cover the school fees of the children and to cope with the typical family expenses.  In the future, the members will get their supplies from other places in Mali, especially from Gao and Kidal. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2050,"image":{"id":217570,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"To buy sacks of n\u00e9r\u00e9 nuts to make soumbala.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"KOUTIALA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.383333 -5.466667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2008-11-01T07:00:52Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2050,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dado","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nachata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Oumou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ma\u00efmouna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-17T02:52:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":1050000,"loan_amount":2050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":175000},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":175000},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":175000},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":175000},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":175000},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":175000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":341.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":341.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":341.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":341.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":341.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":341.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":341.67,"local_amount":175000,"processed_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:29:47Z","rounded_local_amount":175503.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9974052,"comment":null},{"amount":341.67,"local_amount":175000,"processed_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:28:32Z","rounded_local_amount":175503.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14889425,"comment":null},{"amount":341.67,"local_amount":175000,"processed_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:13:45Z","rounded_local_amount":175503.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20440218,"comment":null},{"amount":341.67,"local_amount":175000,"processed_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:09:52Z","rounded_local_amount":175503.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135586,"comment":null},{"amount":341.66,"local_amount":175000,"processed_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:31:52Z","rounded_local_amount":175503.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033387,"comment":null},{"amount":341.66,"local_amount":175000,"processed_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:41:09Z","rounded_local_amount":175503.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44620789,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-11-03T02:52:00Z","paid_date":"2009-06-16T02:41:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":71318,"name":"Edison","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Edison T., 33, is a member of the Tuwoda group in Kamwokya.

Mariam is proud to be the only Hajjat in the group of Nkokonjeru. Her business is buying and selling mukene (small silvery fish) from Nkombwe landing site in Ngogwe Sub County for eight years now. Before this business, Hajjat used to sell tomatoes and onions, but because they were perishables, she was always losing money.\r\n<P>\r\nWith the small fish, it\u2019s a matter of drying them properly; do so and they will last for a very long time. Mariam says the prices of the fish keep fluctuating depending on the season, and this influences her selling price. Mariam is a widow who cares for five orphans and three other orphans (her stepchildren), who are all in school; two are in candidate classes.\r\n<P>\r\nSince she started getting loans, Mariam has managed to care for her family and has bought some land for farming hence reducing the cost of buying everything including food.

They are all married and live in traditional extended families with co-wives and other parents in San Prefecture (fourth administrative region of the Republic of Mali).  United by ties of profession and community, the members decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso loan program two years ago.  The group is on its fourth solidarity loan (group loan).

Essentially, her family of five people depends upon her business' success. \r\n\r\nThough her store is quite well stocked, she requires a loan to increase the variety of products and to obtain greater profits.\r\n\r\nShe is asking for financing to buy the following : 60 pounds of chicken which costs US$1\/lb., 2 dozen bottles of La Lechera milk (US$30\/dozen), 30 pounds of beef (US$1.50\/lb.), 2

She says they plan on getting married. In the early mornings, she prepares means for her children and her husband, and in the afternoons she carries out vegetable sales. First she goes out and purchases all kinds of vegetables from farmers and then she sells them in the markets once or twice per week. She has been doing this for the last 5 years. This time she has a full load of carrots to take to the wholesale market in Tarma. She loves doing this kind of work because she feels very independent and she likes to contribute towards the household expenses.  The difficulties lie in that each time she purchases her products the transport she takes charges her extra for every sack, and this reduces her overall earnings. The reason why she and her husband work so hard, is that they as a family would like to have their own house. They are currently living in her mother's home. With the funds from this loan she will invest in the purchase of products with the goal of having greater earnings.  Until now, the little bit that she invests is the little bit that she earns.

He is a humble farmer, who has worked on the tasks of the farm since he was a child.  Now he works selling and buying animals for a profit, which has given him what he needs to meet the expenses of his family.  For this, with his own hands he built a stable in order to keep his animals inside.  Later, over several months of careful feeding he sells them in the markets, where he goes with his entire family.  He also works growing corn and potatoes in small quantities, but he has more land in alfalfa with which he feeds his animals.

He has four children whose names are Sara Rymunda Bracamonte, who is 26 and in her 5th year of studying law, Salvador Alexander who is 23 and works with his father, Julio Cesar who is 20 and in his first year studying industrial engineering, and Leticia del Carmen who is 19 and doesn't study since she is a single mother.  His wife is Maria Else Bracamonte who works teaching elementary school at the Modesto Armijo de Subtiava school.  Jose would like to have a pottery workshop that is more technical which will help to finance his children's studies which he has been able to do up till now with great effort.\r\n\r\nHis business is located in his home in the Sutiava neighborhood.  He has run his pottery workshop for the past 20 years; he took a pottery class while he was working as an educator and he loved it so he decided to start his own workshop which now is the source of the majority of his income.  Through the class, he also met his wife.  Prior to starting his shop, he taught children with disabilities or those that suffer from Down syndrome; but in 1985, he quit his job as a professor because the pay was insufficient to support his family.  He decided to work on his own in his pottery shop.  He will use this loan to finance his business by purchasing more clay, sand, and dirt.  He primarily sells flowerpots, windowboxes, and ceramic plates and cups.  By improving his workshop, he would eventually like to export his goods.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Scott Crandall, Kiva

The group consists of nine people. They all live in the Peak Bang\u2019aong Village in Takeo Province. The group members will use the loan for different purposes. \r\n<p>\r\nMrs. Noeurng Taing is a village bank president. She owns land on which she cultivates rice to earn a living. However, her land has become less fertile. Therefore, she has decided to ask for a loan to buy fertilizers which will help to make her crop more productive. Her husband Mr. Men Meth is a construction worker who earns a small income to help support his family. \r\n<p>\r\nMrs. Noeurng Taing is 31 years old and the mother of three childR.. Two of her childR. are enrolled in the local school. The youngest child is only five years old and too young to work or study. \r\n<p>\r\nThe picture shows all of the members of the group. Mr. Pol V. could not be present so his wife stands in the picture instead. \r\n<p> \r\nAll of the members in this village bank have end-of-term loans. This means they are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK\u2019s main product because they are the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. This allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term.

He started his business by selling rice.  He has been in this business for seven years.  Now, Mahmadnabi carries a wide assortment of legumes, such as rice, peas, soy, mung beans, sesame seeds, and buckwheat.

Their high quality products are in much demand and they have been receiving major orders from an ever growing clientele. To meet this growing demand they decided to join the loan program of the Soro Yiriwaso  (microbank) two years ago.The amounts of their loans has gone from a first loan of 50,000 francs CFA to their fifth loan of 150,000 francs CFA.<p>\r\nBesides their principle business, they manage other activities such as the sale of incense (natural scents known for their odour and smoke) and \"henn\u00e9\" (plant leaves that darken the hands and feet).

The finished products are sold in Kimparana and Koutiala to a wide range of clientele.

Very professional in their business dealings, they export items that the Togolese are fond of (red lentils, shea butter, etc.) and on their return, they buy the articles mentioned above.

They are all engaged in food service due to the location of their village at a much-travelled crossroads. This loan will be used to buy sacks of rice, buckets of peanut butter, and other necessary ingredients for preparing their dishes. The sales are made out of open sheds along the road that passes through the village to a clientele consisting of travelers, transporters, drivers, and village people. They expect to make on average 100,000 CFA in profit of which a part will be used to cover daily household expenses and the rest to make their little restaurants look more presentable. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1775,"image":{"id":218203,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","use":"purchase of ingredients for food service","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"KOUTIALA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.383333 -5.466667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2008-11-01T07:00:55Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1775,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ma\u00efmouna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tenin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Baro","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ma\u00efmouna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djeneba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-17T18:48:26Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":900000,"loan_amount":1775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2009-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2009-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2009-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2009-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2009-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":150000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":295.83},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":295.83},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":295.83},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":295.83},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":295.83},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":295.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":295.83,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2008-12-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:33:07Z","rounded_local_amount":150444.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9974058,"comment":null},{"amount":295.83,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-01-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:28:46Z","rounded_local_amount":150444.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14889431,"comment":null},{"amount":295.83,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-02-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:13:53Z","rounded_local_amount":150444.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20440224,"comment":null},{"amount":295.83,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-03-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:10:05Z","rounded_local_amount":150444.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135592,"comment":null},{"amount":295.83,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-04-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:32:31Z","rounded_local_amount":150444.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033393,"comment":null},{"amount":295.85,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-05-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:41:32Z","rounded_local_amount":150443.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44620795,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-11-03T18:48:26Z","paid_date":"2009-06-16T02:41:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":71631,"name":"Maria Del Refugio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda inicio hace 3 a\u00f1os con el negocio en los mercados rodantes porque tenia L. necesidad D. apoyar a su marido con los gastos  D.
