Her husband is in charge of working their land.  Their home is located in the community of Las Am\u00e9ricas in the town of Patuca.  Do\u00f1a Santos started earning her livelihood by selling tamales.  Sometime later she bought a bag of donuts and came up with the idea of starting a new business.  She used her earnings to begin placing bags of donuts on the front wall of her home so that children passing by on their way to school could buy them.  Santos later thought about selling groceries and set aside a small space in her house for installing a few shelves so that she could begin selling all types of products.  She was not able to buy many products since she did not have sufficient capital, but now that she has access to loans from FAMA, Santos is able to gradually stock her store.  Her schedule of operation is from 7am to 7pm.  When her children come home from school, they help with managing the store.  The greatest challenge that Do\u00f1a Santos faces is the location of her home, which is some distance from the main road that leads to town.  This makes it difficult to have products delivered and the cost of transportation is expensive.  For this reason, her goals are to acquire a small pick-up truck and to help her children finish their studies.  \r\n<p>\r\nDo\u00f1a Santos is requesting a loan to buy products such as rice, sugar, lard, laundry detergent, dish soap, soft drinks, beans, coffee, bread, donuts, candy, juices, and other products.

Together with them he resides in the Las Vegas community of the municipality of Trojes. Don Ubaldo and his family devote themselves to growing coffee, and also have a small grocery store, as well as growing bananas and corn on a small scale. He is a humble and very hardworking man. He began growing coffee 12 years ago and learned it from his family. He has some laborers who help him with the work on the farm, and he and his son also join in on the efforts. His work schedule begins at 6 a.m. and ends at 12 p.m. The advantage to coffee growing is that it is a primary product for exportation and very important to the country. The disadvantage is that often Don Ubaldo has not sold his product at the price he should have, because of the out-of-control actions of illegal middlemen who want to buy the product at a super low price and then take it to other countries, where they sell it for as much as five times more than they paid for it. \r\n\r\nHe also must deal with the fact that at harvest time labor is scarce, and this has caused him some losses, but in spite of everything, Don Ubaldo has always kept going without giving up. He needs the loan he is seeking for fertilizing and clearing over ten acres of farmland. With the support of the loan he will improve his crops, since the fertilization of the soil will be done at an appropriate time, and his family's living conditions will be improved.

He earns a minimum of PHP 350 in daily sales.\r\n\r\nTo help him continue operations of his business, Dante is requesting a PHP 19,000 loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand product inventory. He expects a boost in his business income as he expands his business. \r\n\r\nDante hopes to be able to expand soon, just as he hopes to support his children's schooling up to the college level.

She hopes to keep it as it is, or perhaps later on she will buy a showcase where she would be able to display her products.\r\n\r\nThis is her ninth loan with MFP.  She is very grateful for the opportunity of working with the institution.  She hopes to be able to continue this way for several more years.  She will use the requested loan to buy products to have in stock.  The more her customers ask for, the greater percentage of income she has.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":851891,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy more products like clothes and home accessories.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-08-24T14:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":180.2},{"due_date":"2011-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":187.66},{"due_date":"2011-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":195.42},{"due_date":"2011-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":204.37},{"due_date":"2011-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":212.53},{"due_date":"2012-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":219.82}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.58},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.37},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.28},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.64},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.7},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":450,"local_amount":1200,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:14:21Z","rounded_local_amount":1233,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350897,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-08-26T20:25:25Z","paid_date":"2011-09-17T08:14:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":328362,"name":"Evelyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Evelyn, 30, resident of Bacoor, Cavite City, Philippines.

end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

If prices decrease too much she barbecues or grills them and sells them prepared.\r\n\r\nShe would like to be able to get her degree in education that goes with being a graduate, and she would like to expand her business of raising chickens.\r\n\r\nThis is Nelly\u2019s third loan with the MFP institution.  She hopes that it continues to go well for her in her group like it has so far.  She hopes to be able to continue working with the institution.  She will use the 1,200 soles that she has requested to buy more baby chickens in order to continue raising them and to be able to make her payments on time.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":851927,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy more chickens.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-08-24T15:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nelly ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":225.29},{"due_date":"2011-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":234.6},{"due_date":"2011-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":244.31},{"due_date":"2011-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":255.48},{"due_date":"2011-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":265.7},{"due_date":"2012-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":274.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.61},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.02},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.58},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.43},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.69}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":550,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:12:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1507,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350898,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

age 54, operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that retails groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, five Phillipine pesos worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Marilou earns her living by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. \r\n\r\nMarilou's store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 250 Philippine pesos (Php) in sales every day. She and her husband, Danilo, have one child and live in Pasay City. Danilo is a painter. Together they manage the household while operating the business. Marilou works hard to continually provide income for the family's everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 8,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. Marilou hopes to be able to grow her business soon. \r\n\r\nShe faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay micro-finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":851944,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Pasay City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-08-22T18:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marilou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":533.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40,"local_amount":1599.99,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:40:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1697.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227005421,"comment":null},{"amount":53.33,"local_amount":2133.01,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:35:00Z","rounded_local_amount":2263.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232764589,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2666.96,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:37:14Z","rounded_local_amount":2830.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238571710,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":1600.04,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:31:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1698.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244529260,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-08-22T20:31:12Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T09:31:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":328386,"name":"Allen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Allen lives in Uganda, is married and has two children, one of whom is in school.

age 53, operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that retails groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, five Philippine pesos' worth worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Merlin earns her living by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. \r\n\r\nHer store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 400 Philippine pesos (Php) in sales every day. She lives on Pasay City. Her husband Pedro works overseas. Merlin manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 8,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMerlin hopes to be able to grow her business soon, as she also hopes to live a peaceful life. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay micro-finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":851952,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy

Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is a married and loving father of three children.  He makes raw bricks and then sells them.  Besides this, he is involved in animal husbandry.

She earns a minimum of 750 PHP in sales every day.\r\n<p>\r\nTo help her continue operations, she is requesting a 20,000 PHP CCT loan.

Therefore there is a need for computers, especially for students who need to do research and write papers. Ivy rents out computers by the hour and offers printing and typing services. Aside from this she also sells electronic cell phone loads. Her regular customers are her neighbors and members of the local community. Ivy earns a minimum of 800 Philippine Pesos (PHP) every day.\r\nTo help Ivy continue to operate her business, she is requesting a loan of 8,000 PHP. She will be using the loan to buy computer parts, software and electronic loads for her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\nIvy hopes to add more computer units in her shop. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week, and this is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":851995,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Computers","sector":"Services","use":"to buy computer spare parts and cell phone load products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Pasay City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-08-22T21:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ivy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":533.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40,"local_amount":1599.99,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:41:01Z","rounded_local_amount":1699.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227005428,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2667.01,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:35:04Z","rounded_local_amount":2832.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232764596,"comment":null},{"amount":53.33,"local_amount":2132.96,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:37:17Z","rounded_local_amount":2265.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238571717,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":1600.04,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:31:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1699.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244529267,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-08-22T23:24:59Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T09:31:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":328427,"name":"Hai","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hai is 58 years old and married with three children.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nYolanda operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 PHP worth of cooking oil or an egg. Yolanda earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting an 8,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, beverages and other products to expand her inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nYolanda hopes to grow her business and give her child a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":852015,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to pay for grocery items and products needed in her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Pasay City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-08-23T00:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yolanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":533.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40,"local_amount":1599.99,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:41:06Z","rounded_local_amount":1699.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227005429,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2667.01,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:35:09Z","rounded_local_amount":2832.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232764597,"comment":null},{"amount":53.33,"local_amount":2132.96,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:37:23Z","rounded_local_amount":2265.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238571718,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":1600.04,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:32:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1699.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244529268,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-08-23T01:03:17Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T09:32:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":328438,"name":"La","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"La sells vegetables, meat and groceries and her husband is a farmer who also raises cows at home.

Editha works hard to continually provide income for the family's everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nEditha oversees operations of their jeepney (see footnote) transportation business. They have two jeepney units that have a capacity of 18 people who pay a boundary (daily quota) each day. Editha\u2019s husband also drives one of their jeepneys if their driver is not available. Their regular customers are students and employees in the local community. The business collects a minimum of PHP 1,800 in boundary every day. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, Editha is requesting a PHP 28,000 loan to pay for spare parts and maintenance of her jeepneys. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nEditha dreams of acquiring another jeep or van. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members weekly to share stories of her work and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\nFootnote: Curiously, jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly Philippines.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

A widow, she manages her own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nEsnarda operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a 5 PHP-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Aside from this, she is also selling home-cooked meals to her neighbors and retails herbal\/organic products. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 40,000 PHP loan.

rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
