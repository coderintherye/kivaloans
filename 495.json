While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from planting and harvesting corn for sale. Teresita has been engaged in her business for over 25 years and earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Teresita joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Teresita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 33,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to to purchase fertilizers such as manure. Teresita is requesting a new loan of 35,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise. This will be the 8th loan taken out by Teresita from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas.

is Clemencia A., 57, a resident of Bacoor, Cavite City, Philippines. She is married to Rodolfo A., a tailor and her business partner. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nClemencia operates a variety store and a tailor shop where her husband is the senior tailor and overseer. A variety store is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go for to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling them by the piece.  Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php 200 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operation of her business, she is requesting a Php 10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She will also invest a portion of the loan to buy tailoring supplies like fabric, etc. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n  \r\nClemencia dreams of being able to renovate her house soon, with all of her work with the business.

V. is a married woman who lives in Purok Makawiwili, Brgy. Mabini, Cadiz City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures: a general store and a tricycle transport business. Her husband Rodolfo, who is 48 years old, works as a driver to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have two children who are 23 and 24 years old. \r\n\r\nFelly joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 20 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Felly has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 35,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 15,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 21st  loan, she is borrowing PHP 40,000, which she intends to buy stock for the general store and perform maintenance for a tricycle so that she can continue to save up for future expansion of her business. Felly V. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\t \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

Her previous loan of 14,000 PHP, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom.

She is 71 years old. Ulpiana is widowed. To make a living, Ulpiana owns and operates a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling bananas and coconuts in the local community. Ulpiana has been engaged in her business for over 20 years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2001, Ulpiana joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Ulpiana has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional bananas and coconuts to  buy and sell. Ulpiana is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and working capital. This loan will be the 5th loan taken out by Ulpiana from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

P. is a married woman who lives in Hda. Banilad 1, Brgy. Nangka, EB Magalona, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating three business ventures:  general store, e-loading and food vending businesses. Her husband Reynaldo, who is 52 years old, works as a Guard Supervisor to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have one child who is 17 years old. \r\n\r\nBrenda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2001 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 18 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Brenda has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 21,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 9,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 19th loan, she is borrowing PHP 24,000, which she intends to buy stock for the general store so that she can continue to save up for future home repairs and expansion of her businesses.\r\n\r\n Brenda P. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\n About NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

To make a living, Divina owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock.

Divina has successfully repaid a previous loan of 15,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase breeding livestock. Divina is requesting a new loan of 18,000 PHP which will be used to purchase livestock feed & other supplies. This will be the 4th loan taken out by Divina from ASKI.

E. is 54-years old, married and supports her family by operating two business ventures: fishing and being a caretaker of a fishpond businesse.  She lives in Purok Banagan, Brgy. Tomongtong, EB Magalona, Negros Occidental.  She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2006 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts.  By working hard in her fishing and fish vending businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable.  She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 9,000.  \r\n\r\nHaydee is now borrowing PHP 20,000 so that she could purchase a new engine for her pump boat.  This will be her 8th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon.  Her previous loan of PHP 14,000, which she paid off well within its term was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Haydee aspires to improve her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

A. is from the village of Cataggaman Viejo, Tuguegarao City.  He is 23 years old.  Delmar is married and has 1 infant-aged child.  To make a living, Delmar owns and operates a transportation business.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from providing motorcycle transport services in the local community.  Delmar has been engaged in his business for over 10 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Delmar joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Delmar has successfully repaid a previous loan of 15,000 PHP from ASKI.  Delmar is requesting a new loan of 16,000 PHP which will be used to purchase equipment to improve the business.  This loan will be the 7th loan taken out by Delmar from ASKI.  He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand his business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

A. is from the village of Talusan, Balingasag, Misamis Oriental. She is 37 years old. Dolores is married and has four school-aged children. To make a living, Dolores owns & operates a specialized retail business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from buying and selling coconuts for copras in the local community. Dolores has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Dolores joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Dolores has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional coconuts. Dolores is requesting a new loan of 4000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. This will be the 3rd loan taken out by Dolores from HSPFI.

Br\u00e9hima hopes to make a profit of 150,000 FCFA per month which he will use to repay the interest on his loans from Soro Yiriwaso, to meet the needs of his family, and reinvest the remainder in his business.

The mutual solidarity of the group was a great learning resource for her. Her sales went from 8,000 francs to 25,000 francs per day.\r\n\r\nShe hopes to bolster her profits with the next loan, which she will use it to increase her stocks by buying one bag of wheat flour, one bag of rice, one bag of sugar, one can of oil, one bag of powdered milk, four bags of coal, one container of baking yeast, and some flavorings. \r\n\r\nHaving purchased plastic tables and chairs to start a small restaurant, she was able to set up a place where her customers can enjoy their rice pudding, fritters and pancakes on the spot. \r\n\r\nBeing divorced, she is now able to care

After working abroad for a while, he finally came home. He loves his work very much and desires to improve the financial situation of his family, who has always supported him, but especially since his return.

She has been working from home for over ten years making track suits, T-shirts and other items by order as well as making alterations. Amongst her steady clients are three schools, some kindergartens and individual clients. During the year she works alone, but in January and February she hires another person to help her because she receives many orders from schools at this time of year. \r\n\r\nWith this loan she will purchase an industrial sewing machine. This is what she needs right now, even though she has four other sewing machines, which she uses for other work. Her goal is to continue expanding her business and increase both her workshop space and her client base.\r\n\r\nAdriana is very grateful for the help from Fondo Esperanza, both for the loans they provide her and for the workshops, which they run regarding business administration. The workshop that has helped her the most up until now was the workshop that taught her how to record her expenditures and income in an accounts book, which has helped her to better organize both her time and her money.\r\n\r\nVi\u00f1a del Mar is both a city and a commune located in the region of Valpara\u00edso on the central coast of Chile. It is known as the Garden City because of its beautiful places and courtyards and is considered to be the tourist capital of Chile. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":639030,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"Industrial sewing machine","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CL","country":"Chile","town":"Vi\u00f1a del Mar","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-30 -71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":157,"posted_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adriana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CLP","disbursal_amount":413612,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":31718},{"due_date":"2010-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":32516},{"due_date":"2010-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":32939},{"due_date":"2011-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":33368},{"due_date":"2011-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":33802},{"due_date":"2011-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":34243},{"due_date":"2011-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":34688},{"due_date":"2011-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":35140},{"due_date":"2011-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":35598},{"due_date":"2011-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":36061},{"due_date":"2011-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":36531},{"due_date":"2011-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":37008}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.1},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.79},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.68},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.59},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.51},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.44},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.38},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.34},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.31},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.29},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.28},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.29}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":205.57,"local_amount":97173,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:04:52Z","rounded_local_amount":98776.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188679453,"comment":null},{"amount":142.1,"local_amount":67170,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:22:13Z","rounded_local_amount":68278.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191420887,"comment":null},{"amount":145.82,"local_amount":68931,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:38:30Z","rounded_local_amount":70068.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195839713,"comment":null},{"amount":149.65,"local_amount":70738,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:59:45Z","rounded_local_amount":71905.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201282207,"comment":null},{"amount":153.57,"local_amount":72592,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:56:27Z","rounded_local_amount":73789.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206150217,"comment":null},{"amount":78.29,"local_amount":37008,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:11:10Z","rounded_local_amount":37618.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211223311,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-12-02T02:29:48Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T11:11:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":248304,"name":"Juan Jos\u00e9","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Juan Jos\u00e9 M.

Ashley is currently employed by the Public Health Department as a Disease Intervention Specialist. Whenever a person tests positive for a disease, a specialist visits that person to follow up, conduct an interview, and refer him or her to an agency. With Baton Rouge being the city with the second highest ratio of people with HIV\/AIDS in the United States, Ashley realized that the current agencies were overwhelmed. While she has been working at her current job, she is also studying for her PhD in Public Health at Waldon University, applying for funding for her non-profit, and completing the extensive application to qualify for non-profit status. As soon as she attains enough funding, Ashley plans on resigning from her current job and completely dedicating herself to starting the Capital Area Phoenix Initiative. \r\n\r\nAshley decided to start this non-profit because on a daily basis, she witnesses how challenging it is to navigate the medical system, especially with an isolating condition like HIV\/AIDS. This non-profit will help clients apply for Medicaid, insurance, food stamps, and find counseling and support. Furthermore, Ashley is dedicated to educating the public about the prevention of HIV\/AIDS as well, which differentiates her agency from others. Once Ashley finishes her certification for Medicaid at the end of November, she will be able to start taking referrals and working with clients. \r\n\r\nAshley plans on hiring six employees in the beginning to help her accomplish the tri-fold vision of her business: outreach and prevention, case management, and ultimately, a free clinic. Her goal is to open her doors on World AIDS day on Dec. 5th to offer free AIDS testing. Aside from applying for non-profit status, Ashley\u2019s biggest challenge was finding a space for an office that would be located within a larger building so that clients could enter the building without fear of being noticed. Ashley is very proud that she found the perfect location after looking for quite a while. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Ashley plans on buying office equipment and signs. Ashley\u2019s motivation is unstoppable because \u201cI want to be a better person and be more humble about helping others. That\u2019s my goal in life. This infection could happen to anybody at any time. It doesn\u2019t differentiate between race, age, or gender. My goal is to prevent more people from getting this.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1761.41,"image":{"id":632178,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","use":"Office

She lives with her 4 children in her own home.  Her husband is out of the country.  She has been farming for 15 years.  She regularly grows potatoes and corn.  She takes her produce to the main markets of her city to sell.  Her great advantage is that she has her own land where she grows her crops.  She also has the support of her family and her children who are already adults and always support their mom.  However, when she has a lot of hard work both in sowing and in harvesting she contracts laborers.  Aquelina tells us that she likes to farm because it allows her to have food available for her own consumption.  She has also been able to recoup what she invested in her latest harvests.  This is why she would like to improve her production and chose other more profitable crops to grow.\r\n\r\nThis is Aquelina's third loan with MFP.

Gloria C. enjoyed her job at a daycare enough to want her own.  So she started studying and earned her Associate\u2019s degree in child development.  At the same time, she started up her day care out of her own home, serving children under 13.  It was successful enough that she expanded in 2007 from a space for 12 children to one for 33.  Now she and her seven employees provide care, a curriculum of classes year-round, and a food program.\r\n\r\nIn the last few years, Elsa has been struggling financially due to the economic downturn.  Unemployed parents had to pull their children from daycare, so her enrollment dropped.  Thankfully, this past year enrollment has started to improve again.  Elsa took out this loan to improve her building, so that the children would be better cared for and safer.  For example, she plans to do some maintenance on the building and add air conditioning, security cameras, and a small roof over the patio for the children.\r\n\r\nElsa dedicates her life to her three children and four grandchildren.  Her daycare has enabled her to provide for them through the years.  Now, her two older sons help her out with the daycare as she needs it, and her 19-year old daughter is employed there as a caregiver.\r\n\r\nElsa\u2019s greatest success is achieving her Associate\u2019s degree, despite difficulty understanding English.  Not to mention raising her children and starting her business.\r\n\r\nAfter Elsa\u2019s divorce, she found it easy to think negatively. It caused her financial difficulties.  Now, with the loan, her faith and confidence to move forward have returned.  Elsa plans to continually improve her daycare and the service she offers.  She would like to add classes in more topics, such as music.  She is also working to improve her English.\r\n\r\nHer suggestion to other small business owners is to \u201cget advice. It makes a difference. You never know if you don\u2019t ask.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":5600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3251.64,"image":{"id":636083,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Child

up, Allison B. was always interested in owning her own business and when she was laid off, it was an opportune time to pursue that goal. Allison\u2019s knowledge of the construction field is extensive, with her degrees in land development and construction management. With her experience working for a general contractor and development agencies and working as an owner\u2019s representative, Allison understands the trials and concerns of all the actors involved in constructing a building. So when Allison was laid off, she decided to start her own construction consulting business, \"Autumn Leaves\". She consults with, or acts as a mediator between, owners, contractors, and sub-contractors. For example, owners are required to hire a certain percentage of women and minorities for big projects. Allison helps owners meet requirements like these and navigate the system. Also, because many sub-contractors are more knowledgeable about their trade or skills than about how to manage a business, she helps sub-contractors manage their finances and contracts. Allison\u2019s most recent project is to consult with an owner on how to build an energy-efficient office building with walls made out of clay and mud. She will assist the owner to obtain green certification for the building.\r\n\r\nEven though Allison has been recognized as an honoree of the  National Association of Minority Contractors because of the success of \"Autumn Leaves\", this loan will help her expand her business even more. Allison plans on using her loan to buy scheduling software and market her business. This interactive software will allow her to provide a unique service to contractors who need help with scheduling because owners always want a complete schedule from their contractors.\r\n\r\nAllison\u2019s next goal is to consult with companies to recycle their construction waste. Allison says, \u201cI don\u2019t always have a steady check coming in, but I enjoy working for myself. It was what I was meant to do all along. It is so rewarding.\u201d  \r\n\r\nFeel free to check out Allison\u2019s website:

On weekends she sells her animals at the livestock market and what she doesn't manage to sell she takes home to her stable and uses it for her own consumption.

Her story is representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican clients (many of whom recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti). Martha lives in the Hato Mayor region of the Dominican Republic, located in the east of the country. Hato Mayor is a fairly mountainous region where the principal industry is agriculture. Martha's community, like nearly all impoverished areas in the Dominican Republic, suffers from a constant shortage of running water and electricity. As well as Dominicans, Haitian immigrants make up a large proportion of Martha's community.\n  \nShe has owned an underwear business (selling a variety of garments) for three years now and is applying for a loan to invest in stock to try and grow her business. She has previously taken out loans with Esperanza International (Kiva's Field Partner in the Dominican Republic and Haiti) but this will be her (and her group's) first Kiva loan. Martha will use her first loan with Esperanza to set up her business. She says that, since then, subsequent loans have allowed her to successfully grow the business. As a result, Martha says that her family has benefited, as has her local community, because now they don't have to travel so far to buy underwear. \n\nMartha says that her favorite pastimes are studying and spending time with her children. She also says that her most difficult challenge is finding the money to complete her studies. Her dream is simple, and applies to both the present and the future.

She works every morning selling to her work colleagues and in the afternoons she visits her customers.  She leaves her products on credit and collects payments every Saturday or Sunday.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to buy perfume, creams, cosmetics and especially sale products.  Juana has been a member of her community bank for 4 loan cycles and she likes the cohesion of the group.  Her goals are to finish her studies and to continue working."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":641049,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy perfume, creams, cosmetics and sale products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juana Lucelinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":880,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2010-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2010-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2011-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2011-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2011-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":110}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":337.5,"local_amount":330,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:11:13Z","rounded_local_amount":337.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188683327,"comment":null},{"amount":225,"local_amount":220,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:31:49Z","rounded_local_amount":225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191422451,"comment":null},{"amount":225,"local_amount":220,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:40:17Z","rounded_local_amount":225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195841220,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:02:20Z","rounded_local_amount":112.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201283606,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-12-17T19:25:39Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T11:02:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":4,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":248440,"name":"Lina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Lina, de 26 a\u00f1os, es una mujer dichosa, ella junto a su esposo Eutemio, de 34 a\u00f1os, cuidan de sus hermosos gemelos, Andy y Ronaldo, de 7 a\u00f1os de edad.

I started fishing when I was 12 years old.\u201d A native of Southern California, Stuart has traveled up and down the west coast as a fish monger, selling everything from Dungeness crab to shrimp to English sole. His primary buyers are markets and wholesalers, but Stuart has also worked the farmers\u2019 market circuit. \u201cI don\u2019t look at this as work,\u201d explains Stuart, \u201cit\u2019s just what I do.\u201d \r\n \r\nFor over a decade Stuart has run a fresh fish wholesale business - S. Fish - based out of Watsonville, California, and in recent years his wife has joined him by taking on the business finances. The couple love running their own business and have never considered working for a larger company. \u201cI like being my own boss, and making my own decisions. I would rather have my own business and perhaps not make as much money, because the opportunity is always there,\u201d says Stuart. \r\n \r\n\u201cI know most people in the fish business. It doesn\u2019t matter what the economic climate is, if I\u2019ve got the supply, I\u2019ve got buyers.\u201d However, the supply of crab and shrimp is the lowest Stuart has seen in twenty years. Stuart has always worked his way out of tough spots in the past, and in all his years as a small business owner, he has never before taken out a loan. \r\n \r\nStuart is a strong believer in the idea that \u2018when one door closes, another opens.\u2019 An $8,000 loan from Opportunity Fund will open a new door for \"S. Fish\" by allowing Stuart and Stella to make the upfront investment in increased travel costs, which are necessary for them to find new suppliers and boost inventory. And, as business picks up again, \"S. Fish\" will be better off for the extra work they\u2019ve put in to secure those suppliers.  \r\n \r\nIn the end, Stuart emphasizes the point that he enjoys what he does. \u201cI\u2019m having fun

E. is a married woman who lives in Sitio Mahayahay, Brgy. Daan Lungsod, Medellin, Cebu. She earns her living by operating two business ventures: Pig Fattening and Fishing businesses. Her husband Arnel E., who is 39 years old, works as a carpenter to earn his living. They have 4 children who are 8 to 17 years old with two of them already working while the other two are currently going to school.\r\n\r\n Cristina joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past nine loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Cristina has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 11,800, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 10th loan, she is borrowing PHP 20,000 which she intends to use as additional working capital so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. \r\n\r\nCristina E. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.   \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\n In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on  a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

R. is a married woman who lives in Sitio Mahayahay, Brgy. Daan Lungsod, Medellin, Cebu. She earns her living by operating one business venture: a general store  business.  Her husband Rhey R., who is 33 years old, also works to earn his living. They have one child who is 10 years old. \r\n\r\nDivina joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past six loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Divina has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 11,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 12,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 7th loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000, which she intends to use to purchase more stock to sell so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her child. \r\n\r\nDivina R. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\n In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Rio Tuba, Bataraza, Palawan. She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  General Store \/ Liquor Sales and Tricycle transport businesses. Her husband Simpicio Q., who is 57 years old, works as a laborer to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have one child who is 21 years old. \r\n\r\nCristina joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past nine loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Cristina has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 7,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 15,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 10th loan, she is borrowing PHP 20,000, which she intends to use to buy canned goods and liquor for the general store so that she can continue to save up for the future expansion of her general store and do home repairs. Cristina Q. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

With the help of her past five loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Gina has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. \r\n\r\nHer previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 6th loan, she is borrowing PHP 14,000 which she intends to use to fund her business operations so that she can continue to save up for future family needs. Gina G. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\n About NWTF:\r\n\r\n In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

D. is a 40-year-old married woman who supports her family by operating two business ventures: a fishing business and a food-vending business. She lives in Purok Pasayan, Brgy. Tomongtong, EB Magalona, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2007 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts.  By working hard in her fishing and food-vending businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 5500.   \r\n\r\nJasmin is now borrowing PHP 18000 so that she can continue to fund the operations of her fishing business. This will be her seventh loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 15000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom. Jasmin aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well being by following the Dungganon way.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\"). Through the program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She lives  in Malocbaloc, Brgy. Agujo, Daan Bantayan, Cebu. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2009 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her  fishing\/fish-vending  business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 3000. \r\n\r\nCarmelita is now borrowing PHP 15000 so that she can purchase fishing equipment. This will be her third loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 6000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom. Carmelita aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well being by following the  Dungganon way.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\"). NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon, a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

With the help of her past 7 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Amy has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 12,000 helped her increase her monthly profit to PHP 10,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.\r\n\r\nThis time, for her 8th loan, she is borrowing PHP 12,000, which she intends to use to buy a new engine for her fishing boat so that she could continue to save up for the future education of her children. Amy D. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\n<b> About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

With the help of her past 2 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Arlene\u00a0has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow.  Her previous loan of PHP 7,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 2,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.\r\n\r\nThis time, for her 3rd loan, she is borrowing PHP 11,000 which she intends to use to buy more raw abaca to weave so that she could continue to save up for the future and help her husband with the daily living expenses and for the education of their children. Arlene C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\n<b> About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

L. is a married woman who lives in Sitio Santa Cruz, Don Virgilio, Medellin, Cebu. She earns her living by operating a fishing business.  Her husband Eddie L., who is 28 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have 2 children who are 7 months and 2 years old.\r\n\r\nAireen joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired to something better for her family. With the help of her past 4 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Aireen has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 12,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.\r\n\r\nThis time, for her 5th loan, she is borrowing PHP 12,000 which she intends to use to buy a pump boat so that she could continue to save up for the future and to create another business.  Aireen L. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\n<b> About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

Her previous loan of 29,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 24,000 PHP, thus uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her eleventh loan cycle, she is borrowing 29,500 PHP, which she intends to use as additional capital for the business so that she can continue to save up for future house renovation and educational plans. Vilma Z. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon--a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a community member who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

G. earns her living by operating a fish vending business. Her husband, Wilfredo G., age 52, helps his wife with her business. They have six children who between the ages of 6 and 13 years old. The family lives in Brgy. Poblacion, Oslob, Cebu.  \r\n\r\nFlordeliz joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired toward something better for her family. With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Flordeliz has been working hard and incrementally lifting her family out of poverty. Her previous loan of PHP 12,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 7,500, thus raising the family's standard of living.  This time, for her fifth cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000, which she intends to use to fund her business operations so that she can continue to save up for the future of her children's education. Flordeliz G. is truly a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon. \"Dungganon\" is a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable.\" Through this alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities they could not have imagined. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She lives in Barangay Lagunde, Oslob, Cebu. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2005 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her fish vending business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP6,000. Exuperia is now borrowing PHP 15,000 so that she can use it as additional working capital. This will be her 11th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP15,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom. Exuperia aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and to ensure their future well being by following the  Dungganon way.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

They have 7 children who are 10 to 21 years old with one already working while the other 5 children are currently going to school. \r\n\r\nEdilberta joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 10 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Edilberta has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 11th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000 which she intends to use to purchase more stock to sell so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Edilberta B. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

She lives in Prk. Cogon, Brgy. Guinsay, Danao City, Cebu. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2005 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. \r\n\r\nBy working hard in her pig-fattening business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 4,000.  Estrella is now borrowing PHP 16,000 so that she can purchase an additional pig. This will be her 9th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom.\r\n\r\n Estrella aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

Cruz, Brgy. Don Virgilio, Medellin, Cebu. She earns her living by operating one business venture: a fishing \/ fish vending business.  Her husband Vicente B., who is 50 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have nine children who are 4 to 19 years old.  One of their children has their own family. Another one works and the other seven are currently going to school. \r\n\r\nJudy joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Judy has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 12,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,900, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 5th loan, she is borrowing PHP 12,000 which she intends to use to buy fishnet so that she can continue to save up for the future and the business. \r\n\r\nJudy B. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n About NWTF: \r\n\r\n In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

L. is a married woman who lives in Sitio Sta. Cruz, Brgy. Don Virgilio, Medellin, Cebu. She earns her living by operating two business ventures: fishing \/ fish vending and food vending businesses. Her husband Dario L., who is 38 years old, works in furniture to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have five children who are seven to 17 years old.\r\n\r\n Lovyne joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past five loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Lovyne has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 12,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,200, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 6th loan, she is borrowing PHP 12,000 which she intends to use as working capital for her business operations so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Lovyne L. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\n In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

The family lives in Kasur, a small city located in Punjab Pakistan known for its leather industry. They reside in an area named Busti Uneekan in a two-room brick house. The family moved to this area 10 years ago. \r\n\r\nSuraiya has applied for a loan from Kiva partner Asasah to help her husband in his business. With the loan, her husband will purchase leather, nails, and shoe polish in bulk quantities. These purchases will enable him to make shoes in larger quantities and fulfill orders on time. \r\n\r\nSuraiya is hopeful that this investment will help her husband increase his profits by making more shoes to supply to his clients. She is a new loan applicant of Asasah and this is her first loan application.

This will allow her to make and sell parandas in greater quantities. She is hopeful that such an investment will further enhance her business and make her business more profitable. \r\n\r\nShe lives with her family in Kasur, a small city in Pakistan famous for its leather industry, where she has lived for 20 years. The family resides in a two-room brick house in an area named Basti Uneekan. \r\n \r\nRani's husband A. operates a leather-selling business. He provides leather to different shoemakers on order. His business is doing well and his eldest son helps him in his business. Their next-eldest son is 11 years old and studying in third class at school. \r\n \r\nRani is a new loan user of Asasah and this is her first loan application.

To make a living, Clarita owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for breeding. Clarita has been engaged in her business for over 15 years and earns approximately 3,500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Clarita joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Clarita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 9,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase breeding livestock. Clarita is requesting a new loan of 11,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by Clarita from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

She purchases them from Lahore and sells to her local area customers. She has a good reputation among her clients for the good variety and quality of her bed sheets. She started this business after the death of her husband, and now her business is doing well and providing her with a regular income every month.\r\n\r\nShe lives in Pakpattan, which is a small city located in Punjab Pakistan and known for its agricultural industry. She lives in a 2 room brick house with her family in the area named EID Gah. She moved there 30 years ago. Maqboolan has 2 sons. Her elder son sells fruits. He puts the fruits on his four-wheeled cart early in the morning and sells it in different streets of the city. Her younger son works in the factory on a monthly wage. \r\n\r\nMaqboolan has applied for a loan from Kiva partner Asasah for her elder son\u2019s business. With the loan, he will buy fresh seasonal fruits in bulk quantity to offer to his customers and increase sales.
