In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which sells groceries, toiletries, and beverages to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy small amounts of shampoo, cooking oil, or an egg. Mylene makes a profit by purchasing wholesale merchandise and selling smaller amounts. She also sells seasonal fruits in her store. Mylene\u2019s store is located adjacent to her house and her customers are neighbors and local community members. She earns a minimum of 1,100 PHP daily. \r\n\r\nMylene is requesting a 22,000 PHP loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages, and fruits to expand her product inventory and continue operating her store. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business and hopes her business grows into a mini-grocery to better provide for the daily needs of her family. Mylene wants to work hard at her business to give her children a good and high quality education.

Diana's work is very sweet; she maintains a pre-school creche in her home for children aged 2.  She takes care of them and helps educate them.  Though this pre-school is publically supported, she does not receive all the resources she needs, and she wishes to make repairs and improvements to the space used for educating children. What she loves about her job is having the opportunity to watch the children grow and give them a start to a good education. She has free time in the afternoons and sells items from catalogs.

She is married to Julius, an electrician, with whom she has two children. Jolly and her husband manage their own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nJolly operates a door mat business. Her products are small rugs and larger doormats. She makes door mats out of excess textile cloth she bought from the factory. As rugs are a major part of Filipino house keeping and cleaning, rugs are one of the most common products that can be bought, sometimes even from a peddler while you are riding down the highway. She is also into the direct selling business. She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products of popular brands. She directly sells her products to her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 200 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a loan of PHP 8,000. She will use the loan to buy more raw materials like fabric and thread. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nJolly hopes to grow her business in the coming years, and for her family she hopes that they will remain strong even in times of trial. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":849147,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"To pay for raw materials and products she needs for her door mat business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Dasmarinas, Cavite","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-08-20T01:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jolly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":533.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":53.33,"local_amount":2133,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:40:43Z","rounded_local_amount":2264.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227005399,"comment":null},{"amount":53.34,"local_amount":2134,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:35:19Z","rounded_local_amount":2265.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232764567,"comment":null},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":2666,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:37:33Z","rounded_local_amount":2829.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238571688,"comment":null},{"amount":26.67,"local_amount":1067,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:31:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1132.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244529238,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-08-20T01:29:54Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T09:31:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":327272,"name":"Eva","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Eva lives in Uganda.

is 57 years old and married. She is blessed with 7 grown children who have helped her with cultivating the land. The family lives in Tukuran, Zamboanga del Sur, Philippines. Farming is the family's main source of income, as it is for most of their community. She has been irrigating, plowing and planting on farm fields for 2 years. Green surroundings create a healthy and lovely environment around the farm fields. Cirila normally receives PHP 5,280 from her farm production.\r\n\r\nCirila joined Kiva's partner, GDMPC, earlier this year to have easier access to financial services.

Isatu is going to use her share of the loan to buy rice, palm-oil, groundnuts, margi (used to give sauce a sweet taste), etc. in order to cook a larger quantity of rice and sauce to sell.\r\n \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":618.75,"image":{"id":848387,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"to buy supplies in order to cook a larger quantity of rice and sauce to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Waterloo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"8.5 -11.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2011-08-19T21:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":825,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Isatu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ibrahim","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hannah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Issa","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":3500000,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":437500},{"due_date":"2011-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":437500},{"due_date":"2011-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":437500},{"due_date":"2011-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":437500},{"due_date":"2012-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":437500},{"due_date":"2012-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":437500},{"due_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":437500},{"due_date":"2012-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":437500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.13},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103.12},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103.13},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103.12},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103.13},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.12},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.13},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":103.13,"local_amount":437500,"processed_date":"2011-09-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-18T08:14:28Z","rounded_local_amount":445190.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":233268087,"comment":null},{"amount":103.12,"local_amount":437500,"processed_date":"2011-10-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-19T09:16:16Z","rounded_local_amount":445190.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":239286005,"comment":null},{"amount":103.13,"local_amount":437500,"processed_date":"2011-11-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-20T09:08:45Z","rounded_local_amount":445190.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":245311523,"comment":null},{"amount":103.12,"local_amount":437500,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-18T09:15:11Z","rounded_local_amount":445190.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":251315675,"comment":null},{"amount":103.13,"local_amount":437500,"processed_date":"2012-01-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-17T09:24:37Z","rounded_local_amount":445190.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257624142,"comment":null},{"amount":103.12,"local_amount":437500,"processed_date":"2012-02-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-18T08:12:55Z","rounded_local_amount":445190.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263931782,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-08-21T21:12:11Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":327326,"name":"Nedia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nedia is 25 years old and married with eight children.

is Jennifer, 33, a resident of Silang, Cavite City, Philippines. She is married to Lino, a security guard. She, together with her husband, manages the own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nJennifer operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages, piecemeal, to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Jennifer earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 250 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nJennifer hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she hopes to draw her family to God.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5-Philippines-pesos worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Cherryl earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 750 Philippines pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP18,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nCherryl dreams to be able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work in her business.

She is married to Tyron, a messenger, and is the mother to their child. Together with her husband, she manages their household while operating her business, working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nMary Jane operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is a small convenience store that sells groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 PHP worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Mary Jane earns money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling them by the piece. Aside from the store she has a food stall, where one can buy home-cooked meals. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 933 every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a loan of PHP 16,000. She will be using the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. A portion of the loan will be used to buy quantities of products like meat, rice, vegetables, condiments, and seasonings. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMary Jane dreams of being able to give her child a good and high-quality education through all her hard work on her business.

is 34-year-old Idriss.  He is married and has 2 children aged 2 and 1. He has one additional dependent who lives with him because she is his stepdaughter.\r\n\r\nIn 1995, Idriss established his school uniform and tailoring materials business. He began his business because he gained the experience of material sales through his elder brother and because uniform sales gives more profit. Working 7 days a week and 10 hours a day, he earns about 1,100,000 SLL every month from this business.\r\n\r\nHe would like a loan in the amount of 5,000,000 SLL.

She joined when friends invited her to form the group. She currently has an Entel store and an internet shop.

The good care that he consistently provides for his crops means that his harvests are good and his crops in high demand in the central market of the city of Tarma.\r\n\r\nHe has been doing this hard work for 11 years, and now Alberto not only continues to grow crops, but has also bought several sheep, which are now growing strong and healthy.  Accordingly, he now has support for some incidental expenses, as he buys at a very low price with the intent to fatten them and sell for a higher price.  \r\n\r\nDue to his will and strength, he is now investing more money in improving his crops.  He belongs to the communal bank \"Mirando a un Futuro Mejor\", (\"Looking for a Better Future\"), and this is his tenth loan through MFP, where he is a responsible and hardworking person.  This is why he is hoping for your support to continue with his goals. \r\n\r\nOn receiving your support, Alberto will invest the requested money to purchase natural fertilizers for his next sowing season."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":849658,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy

Her crops have provided her with the income she needs to support herself.\r\n\r\nWhat Maribel most enjoys about her work is caring for her crops as she feels very happy doing this.  She has been in the business for 10 years and she considers the most difficult part of her work to be transporting her produce from the farm to the drying areas.  She employs laborers to support her in transporting her crops.\r\n\r\nMaribel will use the loan she has requested to buy more coffee plants which she will then graft and benefit from their fruit.  In the future, she would like to buy more land so that she can increase her crops.  This will be her second loan from MFP and she hopes to receive a small loan so that she can achieve her goals.  For her part, she pledges once more to make her repayments on time as she did with her previous loan.\r\n\r\nMaribel enjoys being a member of her community bank because all the members are responsible people.

She is a widow and lives in a rented house with her 4 children. She has more than 20 years experience in knitting sweaters by hand. With the death of her husband, knitting has become her sole source of income and so she has concentrated her efforts into the knitting business. In order to optimise production and knit the number of garments she needs, she must hire other women to help her. This provides her with a substantial number of sweaters to take to wholesalers on consignment. Despite putting her entire investment at risk, she has known how to get ahead because during this time she has learnt how to manage her income and balance it with a desire to increase her working capital in order to stock basic raw materials. She is new to the communal bank she is a member of and was invited to join by her neighbours so that she could improve her business.

Unfortunately, she couldn\u2019t educate him due to financial constraints and he had to start work as a teenager.\r\n\r\nBilqees has applied for a loan from Kiva's partner, Asasah, for the further expansion of her bangle-selling business. With the loan, she will buy bangles in larger quantity that will allow her to fulfill the clients' orders on time and make more income. Eid (a Muslim holiday) is near and this is a good time for earning more from her business. She is very hopeful that after the loan investment she will successfully be able to sell more and increase her profits. \r\n\r\nBilqees is a regular Asasah client and this is her third loan application.

He offers tractor spare parts and engine repairing services to his clients. He is very expert in his work and his clients trust him due to the quality of his work. Abida works as a seamstress on a part-time basis.
