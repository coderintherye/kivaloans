All Djumagul's children attend the school in her kishlak (mountain village). Since their kishlak is close to the mountains they have problems with potable water. Djumagul's family saves water in large cisterns, but it has to stand for a while before it can be consumed. They also have problems with electricity, and can only have two hours of electricity per day. There is no natural gas in kishlak. But the residents of the kishlak have gotten used to these living conditions a long time ago and do not protest, since everyone is hoping that things will fix themselves soon enough.

Masoli is planning to use the loan to purchase more animals, since he believes that raising more animals will increase his profits. \r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Anya Lyuksyutova, Kiva volunteer<\/b><p>\r\n\u041c\u0430\u0441\u043e\u043b\u0438 \u043c\u0443\u0436\u0447\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0432 \u0432\u043e\u0437\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0435 44 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0442 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 6 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439 , \u043f\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0444\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438 \u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c, \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0439\u043a\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043a\u0430\u0437 \u0441 \u0431\u0440\u0438\u0433\u0430\u0434\u043e\u0439.\u0412 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0443\u0445\u043e\u0434\u043e\u043c \u0437\u0430 \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043c.\u0422\u0430\u043a\u0436\u0435 \u0435\u043c\u0443 \u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0433\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u044b\u043d \u0410\u0437\u0430\u043c \u0435\u043c\u0443 18 \u043b\u0435\u0442.\u0421\u0435\u0439\u0447\u0430\u0441 \u0443 \u043d\u0435\u0433\u043e 5 \u0431\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432 \u0438 2 \u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u044b.\u0412\u0437\u044f\u0432 \u0437\u0430\u0439\u043c \u043e\u043d \u0445\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0442 \u043a\u0443\u043f\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0435\u0449\u0435 \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0442.\u041e\u043d \u0441\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0447\u0435\u043c \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0435 \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0442 \u0442\u0435\u043c \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0431\u044b\u043b\u044c."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":153761,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase and sale of cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Khujand","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.28 69.631667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":"2008-05-10T19:30:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Masoli","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-06-02T15:49:11Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":1600,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":266.67},{"due_date":"2008-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":266.67},{"due_date":"2008-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":266.67},{"due_date":"2008-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":266.67},{"due_date":"2008-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":266.67},{"due_date":"2008-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":266.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":79.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":80,"local_amount":269.47,"processed_date":"2008-06-19T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:18:46Z","rounded_local_amount":273.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":242317,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":80,"local_amount":269.47,"processed_date":"2008-07-19T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:22:41Z","rounded_local_amount":273.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":271331,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":80,"local_amount":269.47,"processed_date":"2008-08-19T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T05:46:03Z","rounded_local_amount":273.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":300558,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":80,"local_amount":269.47,"processed_date":"2008-09-19T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-25T07:22:15Z","rounded_local_amount":273.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331244,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":80,"local_amount":269.47,"processed_date":"2008-10-19T09:00:03Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-20T07:18:13Z","rounded_local_amount":273.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":365315,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":75,"local_amount":252.65,"processed_date":"2008-12-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T01:48:31Z","rounded_local_amount":256.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9961444,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-05-19T15:49:11Z","paid_date":"2009-01-16T01:48:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":46136,"name":"Fayza","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fayza is a 38 year old woman.

Notwithstanding, the first meeting was held on a weekend and all of them demonstrated great interest in the program. They were able to manage their time so they would be able to meet on weekends and to solidify the final details so as to form what is known as \u201cMujeres Eprendadoras Artesanas\u201d (Enterprising Women Artisans).<p> \r\nThis is one of the oldest loan groups, in addition to being one with the most additional projects completed so as to increase their savings and, of course, the idea is to always maintain a savings fund for exceptional cases in which the members might need it, for example unforeseen health problems or other disasters.<p>\r\nThe loans they receive will be invested in the purchase of products for making <i>chip\u00e1s<\/i> (a food typical of Paraguay), such as manioc starch, cooking oil, and cheese.

She has worked hard to develop this business which has undoubtedly been successful.  She is asking for this loan so that she can buy a small car. With the car she intends to provide transportation services for people interested in taking her computer classes, but who are otherwise unable to travel to her location, or who can not send their children alone to her business.  For this summer she has already planned and sold out places for a computer summer camp; she has worked hard to advertise for this camp, and says that she actually has a waiting list of children whose parents are paying to send them.  Without this loan though, she would not be able to provide the necessary transportation to her clients so that they could attend her camp.\r\n<P>\r\nHer dream is to make her business bigger and better;  one day in the next two years, she wants to offer computer courses, as well as reading and writing courses (because many people in her community are illiterate).  One of her own children has special needs, and so she says one of her most important dreams is to provide a good future  for her  daughter\u2014to always give her the support and love that her disability requires.  For herself, it is her goal to always work towards improving her life, and who she is as a person.<P>\r\n\r\nOn behalf of everyone here at Esperanza International, and from Yarisa herself, we thank you for your support with this micro loan!  Yarisa\u2019s vision and motivation are truly exceptional and it will be an honor for all of us to watch her make good."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":153987,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","use":"To

This type of business requires a lot of capital. For this reason she joined TYM fund. Usually, she buys cows, raises them until they produce calves then she sells the calves. Each year, she sells a few batches of calves. Each batch brings her a few hundreds dollars. When the cow gets old, she sells it. She started with 1 cow, today she has 2. Her children are grown up so they are able to help her. She is seeking 1200 USD to buy more cows and feed.\r\n\r\n<P><B>Translated from Vietnamese by Khang Ho-Si, Kiva volunteer.<P><\/b>\r\n\r\nCh\u1ecb \u0110o\u00e0n Th\u1ecb Tr\u00e2m n\u0103m nay 45 tu\u1ed5i.

Lending to poor women creates a cascading effect that brings social and economic benefits to a whole family, and thus to the entire community. Moreover, the sense of belonging to a group gives these poor women committee members the energy and motivation to reach success.<p> \r\nIda R., member of the committee called \u201cRosa Blanca\u201d in Asuncion told her sister Gladys R. who lives in San Jose in Ciudad del Este about the program Fundacion Paraguaya offers.

Ida\u2019s hopeful words stimulated optimism among these women and they decided to form a committee.<p>\r\nThe group includes 16 women from different neighborhoods in the city.

Both terer\u00e9 and mate use thermos bottles for the water and \u201cguampas\u201d for the yerba mate (the dried leaves used to make terer\u00e9 or mate).  \u201cGuampas\u201d are generally made of wood, metal or cow horns.  Lately it\u2019s become fashionable to use leather-covered thermos bottles with unique designs, engravings and colors.\r\n\r\nHugo has a vehicle that he uses primarily for delivering his products and for purchasing materials.  He is applying for a loan to purchase thermos bottles, leather and \u201cguampas.\u201d\r\n\r\nTranslated from Spanish by Todd M. Anderson, Kiva volunteer.\r\n\r\nEl se\u00f1or Hugo Sebasti\u00e1n R. es casado y padre de dos hijos; ellos viven en una casa propia en la cuidad de \u00d1eemby. Hugo se dedica a la venta de termos forrados en cuero para mate o terer\u00e9 que son las bebidas mas consumidas en nuestro pa\u00eds.\r\n\r\nEl terer\u00e9 es la bebida m\u00e1s t\u00edpica de nuestro pa\u00eds, es pr\u00e1cticamente un sello que nos caracteriza, el mismo es consumido ya que en nuestro pa\u00eds las altas temperaturas son muy comunes en la mayor parte del a\u00f1o, es por ello que se toma el \u201cterer\u00e9\u201d que consiste en agua bien fr\u00eda a la cual  se le adiciona remedios refrescantes o naturales que poseen distintos tipos de propiedades como diur\u00e9ticos, adelgazantes, para la presi\u00f3n sangu\u00ednea alta, para la buena digesti\u00f3n, entre otros.\r\n\r\nEl mate por otra parte es lo mismo pero se toma con agua caliente. Para ambos casos se utilizan termos para el agua y \u201cguampas\u201d hechas de madera, metal o del mismo cuerno de los vacunos, en donde se coloca yerba para luego ser tomada con el agua, por lo que est\u00e1 muy de moda utilizar termos forrados en cuero de vaca y que pueden tener distintos dise\u00f1os, gravados y colores.\r\n\r\nHugo posee un veh\u00edculo que lo utiliza principalmente para hacer entregas de sus mercader\u00edas y para la compra de sus materiales. El cr\u00e9dito que solicita lo invertir\u00e1 en la compra de termos, cuero, y guampas."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":154461,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":"Purchase of

She is a single mother of four children (three girls and one boy).  One daughter works, and the other three are studying at the university.  Since birth she has lived in her mother\u2019s house, which she inherited.  The dwelling is constructed of \u201ctaquesal\u201d (mud and wood) and it has a roof made of mud tiles.  She wants to preserve the structure given she considers it historical, and with previous credits she has been able to make some small maintenance repairs.  This eighth loan would help her to raise a new wall, to replace one that is crumbling, and also to make repairs to the roof.  She is a person who is much-appreciated by her young students, as well as by the educational community for her responsible nature, her honesty and prestige among the teaching profession.  She states she wants to continue working with AFODENIC for the attention they provide and for the loans which have been very opportune in her life.   <p>\r\n\r\n<p><b> Translated from Spanish by Mary

during the week and returning to her home for the weekends.  She started to work with credit from AFODENIC in the year 2000, using her first loan to purchase land where she has built her home.  With this ninth loan she wants to add \u201crepello\u201d (an extra coating of cement that is thrown onto the side of a wall) to her house before winter starts, to give it more strength and protection.  She will also tile and, lastly, add paint, as she wants to give her five year old daughter and her mother a dignified and presentable dwelling.  She has 10 years in the education sector and with much sacrifice she is working toward a degree in computers at the university.  A year ago, she was transferred to the San Patricio School where she acts as director due to her responsibility, honesty and dedication to providing an education for the boys and girls of her community.  She expressed gratefulness to AFODENIC because, thanks to this organization which is characterized for giving assistance to the most vulnerable, she has been able to reach goals that she\u2019s had since childhood.  <p>\r\n\r\n<p><b> Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn, Kiva Volunteer. <\/b><p>\r\n\r\nLa Joven Irma Cesilia es trabajadora del MINEd, inici\u00f3 sus labores de educadora joven a la edad de 17 a\u00f1os en la Piedra Pintada, donde permanecia toda la semana, viajando a su casa los fines de semana.

Poipet is a wild town, characterized by casinos and heavy traffic. In the midst of all of this, Much N. runs a small tailoring business from which she earns US$4 per day. Her husband is a motor taxi driver and competes daily with the thousands of men who share his profession, for the patronage of arriving tourists. One of their children resides with them in Poipet and helps her mother with the tailoring business. Their other child is married and lives back in their home province of Kampong Cham. Much N. wants to invest in her own business by buying a sewing machine. Up to this point all of her work has been done by hand, but with a sewing machine she will be able to take on many more orders.
