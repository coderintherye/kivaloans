Maximiliana loves to be a farmer, something she has been doing since she was a little girl and now with the help of her husband her work is much lighter. Her plans for the future are to keep sowing and her mother also proposed giving her the store and she has accepted. She will start working in the store and with time she will be able to pay her mother the value of the grocery store. This is her eighth consecutive loan with MFP (Kiva Field Partner) and all this time she has been participating responsibly. In her role as the treasurer she has been carrying out her duties and she has been making her payments on time. The funds that she is requesting now will be used to purchase fertilizers and some of the money will be used to pay for the handover of the store from her mother.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Erika Lindig, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":306920,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase fertilizers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-04-22T18:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maximiliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":300,"loan_amount":100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:43:48Z","rounded_local_amount":308.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990360,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-04-22T20:32:03Z","paid_date":"2009-07-15T22:43:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":103150,"name":"Ayawavi","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Cette jeune dame c\u00e9libataire a une formation en secr\u00e9tariat bureautique, mais ne trouvant pas du travail elle a ouvert sa propre boutique dans laquelle elle fait du traitement de texte et la photocopie.

Now that he's an adult, he uses the same method to cultivate his peas.  But this time his plants are not developing the way he expected them to and he doesn't understand why since he planted on plots of land planted with potatoes that were already fertilized.  So now he will have to buy chemical fertilizers to make the peas grow and produce good returns.  Percy loves his agricultural work.  He plants peas each season because they are very profitable.  He brings them to the market to sell once they are harvested.  He doesn't plan to have a family yet.  He wants to plant many hectares to earn more money.

The member misses his community and family a lot, but he went to study computer science and marketing in the city of Cusco.  He will open an internet caf\u00e9 in Cusco, even though his real dream is to invest in his village which he sees somewhere in the future because there is no private support.\r\n<p>\r\nThe member asks for a loan to invest in his internet caf\u00e9.  The member indicates that if someone is interested in investing in his community they can send him an e-mail at yurici10@hotmail.com.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by William Gray, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":306940,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Internet Cafe","sector":"Services","use":"To buy internet stalls.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chinchero - Urubamba - Cusco","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":119,"posted_date":"2009-05-02T01:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yuri ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":369.25},{"due_date":"2009-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":384.03},{"due_date":"2009-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":399.39},{"due_date":"2009-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":415.36},{"due_date":"2009-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":431.97}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.01},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.81},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.8},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.99},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140.39}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":199.93,"local_amount":615.16,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T18:06:48Z","rounded_local_amount":616.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52918299,"comment":null},{"amount":106,"local_amount":326.16,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T11:26:53Z","rounded_local_amount":326.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63139138,"comment":null},{"amount":110.24,"local_amount":339.2,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T12:20:45Z","rounded_local_amount":340.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73564758,"comment":null},{"amount":114.65,"local_amount":352.78,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T13:09:45Z","rounded_local_amount":353.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86998348,"comment":null},{"amount":119.18,"local_amount":366.7,"processed_date":"2009-10-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T14:40:26Z","rounded_local_amount":367.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96910821,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-05-03T05:05:19Z","paid_date":"2009-11-15T14:40:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":103167,"name":"Regina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Regina L. is 33 years old.

Nonetheless, her husband, who works as a sales clerk, is by her side and helps support her.  She has a bakery  on the premises of her house where she bakes a variety of breads.  She has been running her business for 5 years and has been very successful.  One advantage of only having to support herself and her husband is that there are much fewer expenses and they are able to live a comfortable and tranquil life.  One thing she likes about her business is that many people come from various places to purchase her bread for its good quality and delicious taste.  The high quality of her breads and her strategic location help to ensure the profitability of her bakery.  In the future, Maria would like to have an ice cream shop to compliment the pastries in her bakery.  She has had 9 loans through MFP and she likes to work with her communal bank because there is a sense of unity and understanding amongst her colleagues.

She lives with her husband who is supportive of her.  The house that they live in is theirs.  For four years she has been selling food (chicken soup) in a space that her children set up for her outside of their house.  She only sells her dish in the morning because it is in high demand during the early hours of the day because of its restorative properties.  The thing she likes most about her work is that many people savor the good flavor of her food.  Giving her customers a good product is very important for Zarela, since this determines whether customers return to her business.  The most difficult part is that she is not located in the most convenient location.  However, her business is profitable because she is located in a good area.  This is her 8th loan with MFP and she likes to work with her communal bank because her colleagues are united and responsible with their payments.

Maura's biggest desire is to increase her production to generate more income for her family and satisfy their needs that way.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jonathan Bradshaw, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":307094,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Work capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-04-24T00:30:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maura Cecilia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":4900,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":816.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":816.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":816.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":816.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":816.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":816.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":816.67,"processed_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:09:14Z","rounded_local_amount":841.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44446243,"comment":null},{"amount":42.31,"local_amount":829.35,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:42:03Z","rounded_local_amount":854.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52956875,"comment":null},{"amount":166.02,"local_amount":3253.98,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-19T08:58:00Z","rounded_local_amount":3352.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63174301,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

Domingo will utilize the loan to buy at least three sacks of feed for his hogs and some will be used to buy some farming inputs.

everything you do, put God first, and he will lead you to success.\u201d This is the favorite saying of Claribel, a simple mother and a faithful wife to Armando Jr. They live in a rural place located in Barangay Manamtam, Bambang, Nueva Vizcaya. Claribel only finished high school because they got married at an early age with no job at the beginning. Since then, the couple diligently looks for business opportunities to support their family and their future children. \r\n\r\nClaribel found work as a dealer of AVON products. She sells them to her friends and cousins. In this way, she is able to help her husband earn a living for their family while he cultivates their farm that they inherited from his parents. They help each other to have a better way of living. When she learned about the KIVA loans, she was encouraged to borrow at least 5, 000 PHP as working capital to her direct selling of AVON items. She hopes to become successful in her chosen career and that someday, it will become progressive.

He sometimes does furniture work but because he does not have enough capital, he just focuses in operating his tricycle.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Domingo learned about Kiva lenders, he decided to request a loan of PHP 5,000 for the maintenance of the motorcycle he uses for his business.

Gina is a kindhearted person who is always willing to help other people. She is also a responsible mother and diligent business woman. \r\n<p>\r\nGina sells different kinds of footwear (slippers) for men and women and sometimes she also sells used clothes (ukay-ukay) in their neighborhood. She is hoping to obtain a loan of PHP 10,000 that she can use as additional capital to purchase slippers in bulk and to continue her \u201cukay-ukay\u201d business. She plans to send her eldest child to college and to take a management course thus, she really needs to work hard to increase her income and help her husband to meet their daily needs. Her retailing business has expanded and she hopes that it will remain strong until her children finish their studies.\r\n<p>\r\nGina believes that we must keep our hearts open to dreams because as

This is the traditional way of gold mining. It uses only simple tools to look for gold along the river. At the end of the day they deliver their gold to their buyer and receive a maximum payment of PHP 200.00 per day. \r\n\r\nEventually, Ricky decided to buy and sell his own gold. He required capital to start up this business and asked for support from HSPFI ( Kiva Partner) and immediately went into business. Ricky is now engaged in the buying and selling of gold. He is buying gold from the traditional miners and sells it in the city. Ricky is one of the active members of HSPFI. According to him, HSPFI greatly assisted him. This time, Ricky is soliciting his 3rd cycle loan amounting to PHP 11,000.00. This is intended for  improving his business.  He wants to buy all the gold from the traditional miners at their mine fields.

Her status is that she is in a polygamous marriage, though she lives alone with her husband and her children in the Sogomougou district of Koutiala prefecture (Sikasso region).  For societal reasons, she did not attend school.  She soon got interested in working to earn an income, notably in fattening livestock, a trade she learned from her mother.  She has been in this business for eight years now, and it is very profitable.  She can sell over fifteen heads of livestock each month for just foreign customers. \r\n<p>\r\nTo do right by her customers and to increase her sales figures, she decided to join the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso five years ago.  After eight solidarity loans (group loans), all correctly repaid without difficulty, she is on her second individual loan.

F., Elizabeth M. B., Patrick A., John A. TarawA., Edmon K. and Henry Sesay. They work for a local non-governmental organization called Future In Our Hands (FIOH). This is the first time they are seeking a loan from SMT. Because non-governmental organizations' salaries are usually very small and do not allow one to do something big with their lives, they have  come to seek a loan from SMT to allow them to invest in something meaningful. Some of them will invest their loans in business and others will invest in the education of their children.\r\n\r\nFIOH started its operations in 1993 and has it headquarters in Makeni with sub-offices in Mile 91 and Kabala in the north, and Pujehun in the south. FIOH focuses its operations on agriculture and food security. They also provide micro-finance services to local villages in their areas of operations. FIOH is doing well in serving the community people in their areas of operations, however, as a donor driven organization, they are often faced with financial constraints. \r\n\r\nSamuel (front row right), who is heading this group, is the Admin Officer of FIOH.

It was founded in 1987 to educate the hearing-impaired (deaf) children of Makeni and the country as a whole. This school is one of two hearing-impaired schools in the country. The school has a total of 150 pupils drawn from all over the country and a staff of twenty-eight teachers. Since its inception in 1987, the school has trained many deaf children in the art of reading and writing, lip reading, carpentry, sewing and agriculture. \n\nUnlike its counterpart in Freetown, this school teaches maternal reflective methods (lip reading) in addition to signing\/finger reading. However, the school faces some great challenges. Many parents of the deaf tend to use the school as a dumping ground. They bring their children to the school and never again come to see how the child is progressing. Some parents do not care about giving support to their deaf children. And during holidays, some of the parents will never again bring the children back to the school.\n\nThis is the first loan this school is seeking from SMT\/Kiva.  With this loan, they will be able to invest in some petty-trading in order to supplement their monthly salaries. Some however will use theirs to either buy pieces of furniture or in constructing houses. This loan will definitely improve the economic status of these teachers. \n\nAloysius D. K.

He is fifty-nine years of age, married with four children. One of his children is in secondary school, another in college, and the eldest are already grown-ups.

He is married and the father of four children. His wife doesn't work, she stays at home and takes care of the home, feeds their cattle. Komiljon feeds and sells cattle. The spring season for him is the time to purchase cattle since they are cheaper to buy.

She lives in a central neighbourhood of Kinshasa where she has been in business since 1995.  Her first business, from 1995 to 1999, was a restaurant which she opened with $150 in startup capital.  This business became a beauty salon in 1999 because of her health.  The beauty salon did well between 1999 and 2003 because of her speciality.  Since 2003, Kiki has diversified her business: she has added women's clothing in order to increase her income.  She sells \"pagnes\" (colourful cloth worn by women and wrapped like a sarong), dresses and so on.  In order to reach her goal o fopening a boutique selling imported clothing for men and women, Kiki decided in July 2008 to join one of the groups, \"Lisala\", of the MFI Hope.  She has already received two loans which were repaid on time and in full.  The loan which she received in April allowed her to buy \"pagnes\" and ladies' shoes in order to bolster her business.  Currently, her capital is $400.  Her business generates a profit of $60 a week.

She is a local manufacturer of palm oil. Palm oil is produced from palm nut fruits. The palm oil is processed through various stages to obtain the palm oil.  Palm oil is used to prepare many local dishes. Her production is on a small scale due to inadequate capital to buy machines for the processing.\r\n<P>\r\nIn addition to the palm oil business, she is also produces and sells food like banku. Banku is prepared from milled grains and is taken with soup or pepper with fish. She has been in this business for the last three using the proceeds to cater for her family needs. \r\n<P>\r\nShe says this has also slown due to current food prices in the world market.

Samuel is a very resourceful and hardworking father whose hard efforts bring livelihood to the family.\r\n<p>\r\nSamuel supports his children through the sale of used belts and socks. The selling of used belts and socks has a very big market share in Ghana as brand new socks, belts and even clothes are very expensive for the economically active poor. Therefore the selling of used products like socks and belts has created a business for many men. He has been in this business for the past ten years.

Despite her young age, she has bought a piece of land on street 47 of Chasquipampa. She stopped working and formed a family and is totally devoted to her household, attending to her son who has had a health problem since birth. To receive revenue in order to get contruction going on her already acquired land, she has decided to supplement her income by starting to mass produce empanadas, berlins, cakes and pastries, without even thinking of the agreable flavor that she makes in the production of the pastries. \r\nThus she began selling small amounts in the south, beginning only with small quantities. Today she sells pastries in two of the schools with the most students in the south, and further prepares these types of dishes in contracts for customers who already know her or know of her pastries.

In spite of the expenses that she has with her ailing son, she is a very punctual and responsible client.  \t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Daniel Kvaka, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":307840,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Knitting","sector":"Arts","use":"For working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.5 -68.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2009-05-01T21:30:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Catalina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":3300,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":275.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":286.24},{"due_date":"2009-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":297.59},{"due_date":"2009-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":309.38},{"due_date":"2009-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":321.64},{"due_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":334.39},{"due_date":"2009-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":347.65},{"due_date":"2009-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":361.43},{"due_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":375.75},{"due_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":390.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.63},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.2},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.83},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.53},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.3},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.13},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.04},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.02},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.09},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.23}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":41.98,"local_amount":291.68,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T22:32:36Z","rounded_local_amount":294.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44439672,"comment":null},{"amount":40.55,"local_amount":281.74,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:08:44Z","rounded_local_amount":284.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52950192,"comment":null},{"amount":43.28,"local_amount":300.65,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T12:57:30Z","rounded_local_amount":303.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63167132,"comment":null},{"amount":43.55,"local_amount":302.57,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T14:17:30Z","rounded_local_amount":305.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73592590,"comment":null},{"amount":45.82,"local_amount":318.31,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T15:51:13Z","rounded_local_amount":321.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87027968,"comment":null},{"amount":48.06,"local_amount":333.88,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T18:58:15Z","rounded_local_amount":337.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96939947,"comment":null},{"amount":49.42,"local_amount":343.39,"processed_date":"2009-11-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:14:14Z","rounded_local_amount":346.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103781033,"comment":null},{"amount":52.02,"local_amount":361.43,"processed_date":"2009-12-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T12:49:57Z","rounded_local_amount":365.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110670044,"comment":null},{"amount":54.09,"local_amount":375.75,"processed_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:16:44Z","rounded_local_amount":379.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118065634,"comment":null},{"amount":56.23,"local_amount":390.6,"processed_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:48:06Z","rounded_local_amount":394.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123900936,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-05-01T23:19:53Z","paid_date":"2010-03-15T09:48:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":103620,"name":"Zenzontle Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Foto de Izquierda a derecha:  Mar\u00eda Teresa L., Milagros de los Angeles F., Alma Nubia C.

L. and Elba Rosa S..\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Teresa L. is part of the supportive group, Zenzontle.  She has a mini market in her house.  With a loan she was able to buy more products to meet her customers\u2019 needs.  She is single and has two daughters.  They help her with the business so that she can go shopping at the market.  With this loan she thinks she will be able to have a bigger store.  \r\n\r\nMilagros de los Angeles is a single mother who lives with her two adolescent children.  They help her with her business of making hammocks.  She learned this trade from her parents, and she is teaching her children.  She dreams of having a good shop and giving her children a high school education.\r\n\r\nAlama Nubia C. L. has a small bakery in her house.  She makes and sells the bread in her house.  She sells to customers who buy wholesale.  With three sons, she does not hire helpers.  She takes advantage of the familial helping hands.  Her sons go to school and help with the business.  Her husband works in a shoe shop and helps with household expenses.  With the loan she will buy flour, sugar and wood for the stove.\r\n\r\nElba Rosa S. is the coordinator of the group.  She has a store in her house.  She sells basic necessities, which she buys at the market.  She has two daughters.  One is in her last year at the University.  The other, 16, will be finishing high school.  It took great sacrifice to be able to educate her daughters because her husband abandoned her.  She was responsible for supplying them with all of the necessities.\r\n\r\n Their living conditions are humble.  They came to work with Adim through a promotion done in the region.  They liked the way Adim works.  They do not have collateral for a loan, but Adim had faith in them.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

They sell their produce at the Masaya municipal market. They have been in this business for many years, and they have been working with Adim for several loan cycles, demonstrating that they are punctual and responsible people. They are committed to be in good standing with the institute. \r\nMs. Celia Mar\u00eda is a young mother of two young children. She buys and sells fruit at the market very early in the morning. She learned this skill from her mother, who is in the same line of work even today. She is pleased to have obtained loans based on trust. She dreams of being able to give her children an education and a better quality of life. \r\nMs. Aura Lila G. has been a hard-worker since she was young. She is raising her young son on her own. As a single mother, she has become strong enough to work and help her son get ahead in life. He is a student at the local school, and she thinks that he will be able to attend secondary school in Masaya. \r\nMs. Lilliam del Socorro C. is the group coordinator. She was given this post because she can read more then the other members, and can sign her name well. She has been working at the market from a young age alongside her mother. She sells fruits and vegetables. She has invested this loan, she has been able to invest her own money and now has her own stand in which she sells oranges, lemons, tamarind, onions, garlic, etc. She purchase these products at the market, then sells them in her area of residence. \r\nShe has four school age children\u2014three adolescents and one child\u2014who study at their local school. One of her children studies in Masaya because she feels that he should leave the region and take extra courses. Her work schedule begins at 3 a.m. and ends at 2 p.m. When she returns home, she takes groceries. She states that the loan allows her to purchase a greater amount of fruit, which yields her greater profits. \r\nShe motivates her colleagues to be in good stand and keep borrowing so that they can
