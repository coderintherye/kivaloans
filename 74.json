This is 52-year-old Mwashabani M.. She is married with four children, who are between 22 and 30 years old, and she has one other dependent, her niece. In 2007, Mwashabani established a poultry business, and she now seeks a loan in order to purchase additional chickens to raise and sell. She thanks you for your support.\r\n<p>\r\nRaising \"kuku\" is a popular micro-business in Tanzania, especially amongst SELFINA clients. In fact, if you are a regular lender on kiva.org, you may be tired of reading about kuku. You may ask, \"who or what are 'kuku'\"? Kuku means chickens in Swahili, and raising them for sale is popular for a number of reasons. First, they require little start-up capital, so you can start with one or two and either add to them as the business grows or wait until they multiple naturally! Second, they require little space. Third, they produce eggs when they grow, and the eggs can either be sold (to provide additional income) or eaten (to provide a supplementary source of protein). \r\n<p>\r\nAbout SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through sale and leaseback arrangements. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; therefore, they are not considered to be credit-worthy by financial institutions because they lack tangible assets that can serve as collateral. Accordingly, most women in Tanzania receive poor financial support and, as such, have very little income to provide for their basic needs and services. SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. In practice, SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women; specifically, in a SELFINA sale and leaseback transaction, when a client needs working capital, SELFINA buys equipment from that client (to provide the client with cash flow) and then leases the equipment back to her so that she can continue to use the equipment."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":129369,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To

She thanks you for your support.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through sale and leaseback arrangements. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; therefore, they are not considered to be credit-worthy by financial institutions because they lack tangible assets that can serve as collateral. Accordingly, most women in Tanzania receive poor financial support and, as such, have very little income to provide for their basic needs and services. SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. In practice, SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women; specifically, in a SELFINA sale and leaseback transaction, when a client needs working capital, SELFINA buys equipment from that client (to provide the client with cash flow) and then leases the equipment back to her so that she can continue to use the equipment."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":129377,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","use":"To

She thanks you for your support.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through sale and leaseback arrangements. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; therefore, they are not considered to be credit-worthy by financial institutions because they lack tangible assets that can serve as collateral. Accordingly, most women in Tanzania receive poor financial support and, as such, have very little income to provide for their basic needs and services. SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. In practice, SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women; specifically, in a SELFINA sale and leaseback transaction, when a client needs working capital, SELFINA buys equipment from that client (to provide the client with cash flow) and then leases the equipment back to her so that she can continue to use the equipment."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":129389,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To

Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; therefore, they are not considered to be credit-worthy by financial institutions because they lack tangible assets that can serve as collateral. Accordingly, most women in Tanzania receive poor financial support and, as such, have very little income to provide for their basic needs and services. SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. In practice, SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women; specifically, in a SELFINA sale and leaseback transaction, when a client needs working capital, SELFINA buys equipment from that client (to provide the client with cash flow) and then leases the equipment back to her so that she can continue to use the equipment."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":129396,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","use":"To

This is 43-year-old Rhoda K.. She is married with four children, who are between the ages of 12 and 24 years old. In 2007, Rhoda established a clothing business. Rhoda has already received and successfully repaid two loans from SELFINA, and now seeks another loan in order to purchase additional stocks of clothing in bulk. She thanks you for your support.\r\n<p>\r\nRhoda is a perfect example of why micro-finance works and why the vast majority of people in her position repay their loans. A lot of people who hear about micro-finance (or kiva.org) for the first time wonder \u201chow do you make sure people pay back their loans?\" and \"won't the borrowers just take the money?\u201d Such questions wrongfully imply that the individuals who access micro-credit (usually the \"poor\") are less trustworthy, efficient, or educated than other people. Regardless, most MFIs have due diligence procedures in place to assess client risk, as well as measures (e.g., collateral arrangements and group lending, where a  loan in default is borne by the group as a whole) to address this risk. More importantly, there is an incentive that is built into each and every micro-loan: the borrowers are incentivized to repay their loans so that they can receive additional loans as their businesses continue to grow. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through sale and leaseback arrangements. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; therefore, they are not considered to be credit-worthy by financial institutions because they lack tangible assets that can serve as collateral. Accordingly, most women in Tanzania receive poor financial support and, as such, have very little income to provide for their basic needs and services. SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. In practice, SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women; specifically, in a SELFINA sale and leaseback transaction, when a client needs working capital, SELFINA buys equipment from that client (to provide the client with cash flow) and then leases the equipment back to her so that she can continue to use the equipment."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":129399,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To

She thanks you for your support.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through sale and leaseback arrangements. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; therefore, they are not considered to be credit-worthy by financial institutions because they lack tangible assets that can serve as collateral. Accordingly, most women in Tanzania receive poor financial support and, as such, have very little income to provide for their basic needs and services. SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. In practice, SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women; specifically, in a SELFINA sale and leaseback transaction, when a client needs working capital, SELFINA buys equipment from that client (to provide the client with cash flow) and then leases the equipment back to her so that she can continue to use the equipment."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":129410,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"To purchase

She thanks you for your support.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through sale and leaseback arrangements. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; therefore, they are not considered to be credit-worthy by financial institutions because they lack tangible assets that can serve as collateral. Accordingly, most women in Tanzania receive poor financial support and, as such, have very little income to provide for their basic needs and services. SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. In practice, SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women; specifically, in a SELFINA sale and leaseback transaction, when a client needs working capital, SELFINA buys equipment from that client (to provide the client with cash flow) and then leases the equipment back to her so that she can continue to use the equipment."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":129415,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","use":"To purchase

On this farm this father of two began planting vanilla next to his other crops. Vanila is a plant that yields a spice that can be developed into a flavor because of its pleasing aroma. Typically it is put into cakes and other foods. Vanila is a highly valued domestic and export commodity.\r\n<p>\r\nI Nyoman Ladra is very enthusiastic about planting and growing vanilla at the back portion of his land. His wife Ni Made Kasih assists him with the process of readying the land, planting and fertilizing. I Nyoman Ladra bought seeds at a unit price of Rp.3,000 (USD equivalent $0.30) from other farmers. He now owns about five hundred vanilla trees that at this time have begun bearing fruit. Based on an estimated yield of up to 150 kilograms and the price per kilo at this time of Rp. 35,000 (USD equivalent of $3.80), within one planting season -- that is one year -- his sales can be Rp. 5,250,000 (USD equivalent of $574), not including profits from the sale of seeds.

Vanili adalah  tanaman kebun yang di ambil buahnya untuk di jadikan penyedap rasa karena aromanya yang harum. Biasanya dicampurkan dalam bahan membuat kue dan makanan lainnya . Vanili  memiliki nilai ekonomis yang sangat tinggi baik dalam pasar dalam negeri maupun untuk di ekspor. Dengan latar belakang inilah I Nyoman Ladra sangat antusias untuk menanam dan memelihara Vanili .  Proses penyiapan lahan , penanaman dan pemupukan dilakukan I Nyoman Ladra yang di bantu oleh Ni Made Kasih, istrinya .Sedangkan untuk bibit dia peroleh dari membeli pada petani lain dengan harga Rp..3.000.-\/m . I Nyoman Ladra memiliki sekitar 500 pohon Vanili yang pada saat ini sudah mulai menghasilkan buah, dan berdasarkan perkiraan hasil panennya mencapai 150 Kg  dan harga per kilogram saat ini Rp. 35.000.- Jadi dalam sekali panen, yaitu 1 tahun, I Nyoman Ladra mendapat hasil penjualan Rp 5.250.000,- belum termasuk dari hasil penjualan bibit .

This is a long-term farming efffort, because vanilla only yields after having been planted for two years or so, and that too it has to go through several processes such as soil tilling, fertilizing and pollination. A quality yield requires adequate fertilizer and also insecticide and fungus prevention to ward off insects and disease that can plague vanilla stems. In addition, the flowers that become the harvested spice also have to be arranged such that there are a manageable amount of seeds per stem (more or less 10-15 seeds) so that each stem can grow large and long. \r\n<p>\r\nWith a loan from Dinari, I Komang Wistra can buy fertilizer and can give his plants the required anti-fungus treatment and other care. The plantings will thrive and then the only thing that will be left to do is to wait to harvest them. As such, he will feel extremely supported financially. He is very thankful for the funds that he can borrow. \r\n\r\n   <p><b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Aarati, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nI Komang Wistra, 38 tahun, tinggal di dusun Anyarsari Desa Nusasari, sebuah desa di kecamatan Melaya daerah Bali bagian barat .  Yang mana penduduk di tempat ini rata rata bermata pencaharian sebagai petani. Khususnya di lingkungan tempat tinggal I komang Wistra, sebagian besar petani disini adalah Petani perkebunan seperti : Kakau dan Vanili .Hal ini disebabkan karena pengairan diwilayah tersebut hanya mengandalkan air hujan saja .\r\nI Komang Wistra sendiri mengisi sebagian dari 50 are lahan miliknya dengan menanam Vanili sebagai tanaman jangka panjang , Karena tanaman Vanili baru bisa berproduksi kurang lebih setelah tanaman berumur 2 tahun. Dan itupun harus melalui beberapa proses seperti penggemburan tanah, pemupukan dan setelah berbunga juga harus dikawinkan . Untuk mendapatkan buah dengan kwalitas yang baik diperlukan pemupukan yang tepat dan juga penyemprotan hama \/ jamur yang biasanya menyerang batang Vanili. Begitu juga bunga yang akan dijadikan buah haruslah diatur agar tidak terlalu banyak Kurang lebih  10 -15 biji per tangkai sehingga buah yang di hasilkan besar dan panjang .Dengan pinjaman dari Dinari, I Komang Wistra membeli pupuk  dan melakukan penyemprotan sesuai dengan kebutuhan . Tanaman Vanili I Wayan Wistra tumbuh dengan subur dan kini tinggal menunggu panen untuk  I Wayan Wistra  merasa sangat terbantu dari segi perekonomiannya dan ia sangat berterima kasih atas pinjaman yang didapatnya."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":129622,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To

Each day Sayu works hard to help her husband add to their family earnings. Her husband Putu Suatra works as a contract farmer, and so his job is not stable. Through their Tempek group (a traditional organization) in their village, Sayu Kadek Lastri has received a loan from Yayasan Dinari (Kiva partner organization coordinating this listing). With these funds she has purchased female cows with the hope that in the future she will get the cows to birth calves. In addition, the funds were used to buy three pigs. After raising them for three months, the plan is to sell two and keep one for breeding. Each day Sayu Kadek Lastri tends to and cares for her cows and pigs.The calf would only need to be fed grass and tender green leaves that are readily available in Sayu\u2019s garden. For her pigs, Sayu has to buy bran grains and feed mixture. The hope is that within three months the pigs are ready for sale with an estimated price of Rp.1,800,000 (USD equivalent $196) for two. The net gain in those three months could reach Rp.500,000 (USD equivalent 54), and she could use that income to fulfill her family\u2019s needs. Her hope for the future is that her efforts with the cows and pigs will pay off for the family. \r\n\r\n   <p><b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Aarati, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nSayu Kadek Lastri adalah seroang ibu rumah tangga  yang ulet dan tidak pernah tinggal diam saja.

Melalui kelompok Tempek ( organisasi adat ) didesanya, Sayu Kadek Lastri mendapat pinjaman dana dari Yayasan Dinari. Dengan dana ini Sayu Kadek Lastri membeli sapi betina dengan harapan kedepan nanti dapat mendapatkan anak sapi dari sapinya. Selain itu dana tersebut dibelikan 3 ekor babi penggemukan yang rencananya akan djual setelah dipelihara 3 bulan dan satu ekor akan dijadikan induk  babi. Setiap hari Sayu Kadek Lastri memelihara dan merawat sapi dan 3 ekor babinya. Anak sapi hanya diberi makan rumput dan daun hijau yang mudah didapat di kebunnya. Untuk babinya Sayu Kadek Lastri harus membeli dedak padi dan konsentrat sebagai campurannya dengan harapan dalam 3 bulan babi siap dijual dengan perkiraan harga Rp.1.800.000,-.untuk dua ekor. Keuntungan bersih dalam setiap tiga bulan bisa  mencapai Rp.500.000,-  dan dari keuntungan yang didapat dipergunakan untuk mencukupi keperluan keluarganya. Harapan kedepannya agar usaha  ternak sapi dan babinya dapat menguntungkan."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":129666,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy

She plans to use the obtained credit to increase turnover. Increasing turnover will allow her to increase the profit  obtained from the business. Cottonseed oil is in high demand in rural areas, therefore Nigina's business helps the local population purchase this good at an affordable price. Because the seller purchases the good in the same city and does not need to spend additional money on delivering it to the market, the price remains much lower than if it was delivered from the capital.

S., 42, lives in Fayzabad district.  She is a married mother of eight.  Rajabgul has a secondary school education and does not work outside the home.  However, she has been in business raising cows for sale and for their milk for five years.  Rajabgul is applying for a loan to buy a milk cow.  She will sell the milk to wholesalers, earning a good profit.  This will allow her to make payments on the loan, and the cow will remain hers when all has been repaid.  Rajabgul plans to repay her loan within 15 months.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Susie Armitage, Kiva

He buys calves at the market, fattens them over 40-45 days and then sells them back at the same market to local butchers.  This business is his family's main source of income and also allows local residents to buy fresh meat at accessible prices.

B., 40, lives in Jomi district.  He is married with four children and has a high school education.  He works on the Aral collective farm.  He has also been involved in private agricultural activities for about ten years.  He rents some land where he plans wheat and other crops, such as flax.  After the harvest, Aubhon sells a portion of the wheat and flax oil produced for cash.  His family's portion supplies them with flour and oil for the next year.  By developing rural agriculture, Aubhon provides the local market with wheat and oil at accesible prices.  He plans to repay his loan within ten months.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Susie Armitage, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\u0411\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0445\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0432

Murod H. lives in Rudaki. He is married with four children. Murod is 36 years old and has a secondary education. He makes a living buying and selling cattle. He buys cattle from his neighbors in his village and sells them at a regional market. This business gives him a source to make money since he can sell cattle at a higher price at the market, while his neighbors are saving money on their transportation expenses.  Murod is applying for a loan because he wants to increase his turnover. He is planning to repay his loan within 12 months.  <p>\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Jamilya & Keith Leitich, Kiva Volunteers. <\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\u0425\u0430\u0431\u0438\u0431\u043e\u0432

S. lives in the Fayzabad region. He is 25 years old and is unmarried. He has a secondary education. He raises cattle. He has been in this business for 3 years. He is planning to buy a cow using the proceeds of his loan.  This will increase the size of his herd. After he increases the size of his herd, he plans on selling the older cows and raising the younger ones. After the cow gives birth he can sell the milk, which becomes an additional source of income for him. This business gives him a chance to provide for his family as well as supply the local market with fresh milk and meat. He is planning to repay his loan within 12 months. <\/p>\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Jamilya & Keith Leitich, Kiva Volunteers. <\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\u0421\u0430\u0438\u0434\u043e\u0432

Asha M. is 49 years old. She is married and has four children, who are between the ages of 20 and 32.\r\n<> \r\nIn 2004, Asha established a business as a seamstress. Working 9 to 12 hours a day, six days a week, and assisted by her husband and two employees, she earns about $350 per month. Asha has already received and successfully repaid four loans from SELFINA.  She now requests a new loan in order to purchase material and sewing accessories to sew more clothes to sell. She hopes that this loan will enable her to increase her monthly profits by approximately $200. In the future, Asha plans to increase the quantity and range of her stock. She thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\n<P>\r\nAbout SELFINA\r\nSELFINA is engaged in economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through leasing and leaseback facility as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women.\r\n<P>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-Leasing. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed not-credit worthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.\r\n<P>\r\nSELFINA buys and leases equipment to women. When a client needs working capital SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extending a loan to her, then leases back the same equipment \u2013 a process called a sale and leaseback

from Dar es Salaam, Tanzania! Domina A. is 30 years old. She is married and has children, who are ages 4 and 10.\r\n<P>\r\nIn 2005, Domina established a stationary and secretarial business. Domina has already received and successfully repaid one loan from SELFINA.  She now requests a new loan in order to purchase additional stock in bulk. She thanks you for your support.\r\n<P>\r\nAbout SELFINA\r\nSELFINA is engaged in economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through leasing and leaseback facility as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women.\r\n<P>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-Leasing.

She is married and heads a household of five school-aged children.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 1997 she received training from KMET for home-based HIV\/AIDS care, TB ambassadorship and community-based distribution of oral contraceptives. Monica is very well-known within her community for her compassionate work.\r\n<p>\r\nHer main business and source of income is selling fish which she started doing in 1993.

Some criminals broke in and stole equipment from the calling center that she had opened with her son. The store had been open just five months.<p>\r\nJacinta tells us that it was her son who gave her the idea of having a calling center. At first he rented cell phone equipment at his university, but because of the competition he faced, he decided to buy a stand and to do that same business from his home. When she saw how well things were going, his mother thought of opening her own calling center. Thanks to a loan from EDAPROSPO, they were able to buy the necessary equipment.<p>\r\nJacinta is a hard-working woman and in addition to managing this business, she has an internet cafe business and for the past 28 years has run a convenience store. Because of these businesses, the losses from the robbery are not affecting her too much and she knows very well how to get up and start over again. Among her plans are to improve the layout of her calling center so that it has more security.<p>\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Molly Puglisi, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p> \r\n\r\nHace dos semanas la se\u00f1ora Jacinta sufri\u00f3 un robo en su negocio. Unos maleantes entraron y le robaron los equipos del locutorio que abri\u00f3 junto a su hijo. El local reci\u00e9n cumple cinco meses de inaugurado.<p>\r\nJacinta cuenta que fue su hijo quien le dio la idea de tener un locutorio. Al inicio \u00e9l alquilaba equipos de celulares en su universidad, pero frente a una gran competencia decidi\u00f3 comprar un m\u00f3dulo y hacer lo mismo afuera de su casa. Al ver que le iba bien pens\u00f3 con su mam\u00e1 abrir su locutorio.

Now they have eighteen associates and are beginning their second loan cycle.  The associates are all from the town of San Rafael in the district of Socos, which is 90 minutes outsiD. of the city of Ayacucho.\r\n<P>\r\nThe population of San Rafael is predominantly agricultural.  Many people grow vegetables or raise animals.  Some are artisans who make beautiful tapestries and blankets which are used to carry both goods and small children.  In the community bank they have learned to be punctual, responsible, and above all to save.\r\n<P>\r\nThe associates have a variety of different businesses such as cheese making, raising animals, selling meat, growing vegetables, and weaving.\r\n<P>\r\nEach associate has a different story they can tell, such as Flor who buys milk from different farmers and then makes cheese which she sells in the city of Ayacucho.  On the other hand Eugenia works with her husband to make blankets.

Every year she releases 3-4 litter of pigs and earns 500-600 USD. Her fund for breeding came from her family savings and borrowed money from TYM Fund. To repay the money weekly, she sells vegetables and dried food in the market. Mrs. M. thinks the weekly repayment method of TYM Fund is very suitable for her family.

Dairy products are in very high demand all across Azerbaijan, and Akif believes that it will bring him  benefits in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":130730,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase two cows.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AZ","country":"Azerbaijan","town":"Saatli","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.833333 48.416667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":56,"posted_date":"2008-05-04T21:00:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Akif","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-05-21T22:01:40Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":66.61}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.61}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2008-06-22T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T21:13:36Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":245598,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2008-07-22T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T21:15:06Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":274063,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2008-08-22T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T21:18:38Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":303560,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2008-09-22T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-25T07:10:04Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":334401,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":66,"local_amount":66,"processed_date":"2008-10-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-28T07:07:01Z","rounded_local_amount":66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":368498,"comment":"scheduled_repayment (late autopay posting for Aqroinvest Credit Union -
