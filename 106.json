is married with four children. All of her children are currently in school. She treks to the nearby villages to buy foodstuffs like gari (milled and fried cassava), maize and cocoyams and then retails them in the local market.

A. is a forty eight year divorced mother of five children who are currently in school.

He is the youngest of two brothers and he provides for his brother who is visually impaired. He lives with his mother and brother. <br\/>\r\nHemal completed high school and also took a course in Computer Science. He says he didn't continue his education due to his family's financial situation and has run his deceased father's store since 2006.<p>\r\n\r\nIn 2006 he moved to Bela-Vista with his mother at his brother's request to help run the store. Bela-vista is the chief town of the District of Matutuine, in the Province of Maputo. All three now live in a house behind the store. Despite it being owned by all of them, Hemal is the primary manager of the store and opens from 8.30am until 7pm every day with no employees. He learnt how to do business from a wholesaler in Maputo where he was working until his brother asked for his help.\r\nThe emphasis in the store is on everyday necessities and the daily income is 1200,00 MZN, which Hemal is going to start saving. His biggest challenge in trying to expand the business is having a vehicle with which to transport the merchandise. <p>\r\n\r\nHe heard of Hluvuku through other merchants in the area and this is his first loan, be it with Hluvuku or any other institution. Hemal is confident he can improve his business with this loan and grow it well, given that he will be able to respond to his clients' demands.<p>\r\n In the future, he aims to sell a greater range of products and eventually open a computer repair workshop as none exist in the area.<p>\r\n\r\n<b>Translated from Portuguese by In\u00eas Teles, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nHemal  tem 26 anos e nasceu na cidade de  Maputo, e \u00e9 solteiro. Ele \u00e9 o segundo entre dois  irm\u00e3os, sustenta o irm\u00e3o mais velho que tem problemas da vista e sua m\u00e3e ambos vivem na mesma casa e ele n\u00e3o tem filhos. <p>\r\n\r\nHemal completou o ensino secund\u00e1rio  (ate a 12a classe) tamb\u00e9m fez curso de inform\u00e1tica, diz que n\u00e3o continuou por situa\u00e7\u00e3o financeira da fam\u00edlia e desde 2006 esta gerindo a loja do falecido pai. Em 2007 se mudou para Bela-vista  junto com sua m\u00e3e  a pedido do seu irm\u00e3o para o ajudar na loja uma vez que o irm\u00e3o tem problemas de vista,  Bela-vista  \u00e9 uma vila sede do Distrito de Matutuine, Prov\u00edncia de Maputo, onde Hemal vive com o irm\u00e3o e sua m\u00e3e na casa aos fundos da loja do seu falecido pai.<p>\r\n\r\nHemal \u00e9 o principal gestor da loja embora sendo bem comum, tem um hor\u00e1rio di\u00e1rio das 8:30h as 19:00h e n\u00e3o tem empregados. Aprendeu a fazer negocio numa loja grossista na cidade de Maputo onde se encontrava a trabalhar antes do irm\u00e3o o solicitar para vir ajuda-lo a gerir a loja. Os produtos com destaque s\u00e3o da primeira necessidade, o rendimento di\u00e1rio \u00e9 de 1200,00mt e diz que vai come\u00e7ar a poupar. Para ele o maior desafio para conseguir expandir o negocio \u00e9 ter uma viatura para ajudar no transporte de mercadoria.<p>\r\n\r\n\u00c9 primeiro empr\u00e9stimo na Hluvuku e nunca teve nenhum empr\u00e9stimo em nenhuma institui\u00e7\u00e3o e conheceu Hluvuku atrav\u00e9s de outros comerciantes da zona. Hemal esta confiante que com este empr\u00e9stimo o negocio vai melhorar e vai crescer dado que poder\u00e1 responder bem a clientela.<p>\r\n\r\nOs objetivos com o negocio daqui em diante s\u00e3o vender produtos diversificados e futuramente abrir uma oficina de repara\u00e7\u00e3o de computadores uma vez que na zona n\u00e3o existe

is 24 years old and he is from Matutine, district of the Maputo province. Jose is the father of a 2-year-old son and he is married.\r\nJose became a father while attending school. Unexpectedly, his girlfriend got pregnant and Jose had to drop out of school to take care of his family. He stopped going to school in the 10th grade and now he works for the Mozambique's rail system (CFM), earning 3.900,00mt per month. \r\nJose lives in a house that was built precariously and he wants to build a new one using masonry . This is his second loan request from Hluvuku and his first through Kiva. The first loan was used to purchase cement to build blocks. This loan will be used to purchase, among other items, zinc sheets, iron for beams, sand and stones for the foundation. \r\nJose plans on paying the loan back early because the amount will not be enough to pay the construction worker and the person responsible for bringing in the water for the construction. \r\nHis dreams are to continue his education and also acquire furniture for the house -- a project he wishes to complete using other loans from Hluvuku. Jose mentioned that he would not be able to save money from his salary to buy furniture because it would take a long time and also because there are no institutions that are able to set up a savings account in his area.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Portuguese by Bertolt Cantalice, Kiva Volunteer<\/p>  \r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 tem 24 anos de idade e \u00e9 natural de Matutuine, um distrito na Prov\u00edncia de Maputo.

Para ele este \u00e9 o segundo empr\u00e9stimo na Hluvuku e primeiro no Kiva. O primeiro empr\u00e9stimo foi para compra de cimento para fabrico de blocos. Este empr\u00e9stimo pretende comprar chapas de zinco, ferro para vigas, areia, e pedras para funda\u00e7\u00f5es, entre outros.\r\n\r\nJose pretende pagar muito cedo antes do prazo dado que n\u00e3o poder\u00e1 come\u00e7ar com a constru\u00e7\u00e3o porque o valor ainda n\u00e3o \u00e9 suficiente para pagamento da m\u00e3o de obra do pedreiro e de uma pessoa que vai acarretar a \u00e1gua.\r\n\r\nConstitui o sonho para futuro a continua\u00e7\u00e3o com os estudos e tamb\u00e9m mobiliar a casa, projeto que pretende contar com mais empr\u00e9stimos da Hluvuku.

Samuel","description":{"languages":["pt"],"texts":{"pt":"Sabado is 39 years old and she is from the province of Gaza. Sabado has 7 children with two different wives -- 5 of them are from the same mother and their ages range from 8 to 18 years old. His children from the second wife are 13 and 16 years old. Out of the 7 children, only the oldest one does not go to school anymore. Besides his children, Sabado also supports his mother who lives in Chokwe by sending her a monthly allowance. \r\nSabado went to school until the 4th grade and he says he did not continue his education because he traveled during his vacation to another province and once he returned his spot in the school was not available any longer. In 1980, right after his father death, he moved away from the province of Gaza and relocated to Maputo to look for a better life. In 1981 he worked for Vetagro-Boane and between 1995 and 1997 he worked as a security guard when there were many lay-offs and he was also let go. In 1998 he tried following his friend's steps by opening up a chicken raising business but he had to abandon that activity due to a lethal epidemic that killed many of his hens. Sabado lives in his own home.\r\nSabado learned the trade by watching his friends do it since 1998. He has a permanent location on Namaacha Avenue in the town of Mazanbanine and its normal hours of operation are from 7:00am to 9:00pm -- these hours can be longer if there is a great influx of business. He has been engaged in this field for 6 years and with help from two employees he has been able to sell beer for 25,00mt, juices for 10,00mt and semea for 120,00 per bag. Sabado's income varies between 300,00mt and 1000,00mt per month and, depending on the business volume, it could reach as much as 2500,00mt. It is a goal to Sabado to expand and keep his business growing. \r\nHis plans for the near future are open up more establishments in the town where he lives and expand his business.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Portuguese by Bertolt Cantalice, Kiva Volunteer<\/p> \r\n\r\nSabado tem 39 anos de idade e \u00e9 natural da prov\u00edncia de gaza. Sabado \u00e9 pai de 7 filhos com duas esposas sendo 5 filhos de uma mesma pessoa, com idades variando entre 18 e 8 anos de idade. Com a outra esposa Sabado tem dois filhos de 16 e 13 anos. Dos 7 filhos o mais velho j\u00e1 n\u00e3o vai a escola e os outros estudam. Para alem dos filhos Sabado sustenta a sua m\u00e3e que se encontra em Chokwe enviando valores monet\u00e1rios para ela.\r\n\r\nSabado estudou ate 4\u00aaclasse e diz que n\u00e3o continuou por ter perdido a vaga quando nas ferias do fim do ano viajou para outra prov\u00edncia e quando voltou j\u00e1 n\u00e3o havia vaga. Em 1980 mudou-se da prov\u00edncia de Gaza para Maputo a procura de melhores condi\u00e7\u00f5es de vida, logo apos a morte do seu pai. Em 1981 trabalhou no Vetagro-Boane, em 1995 trabalhou como seguran\u00e7a at\u00e9 1997, ano que demitiram trabalhadores e ele foi atingido. Em 1998 tentou seguir os amigos abrindo um negocio de cria\u00e7\u00e3o de  frangos que s\u00f3 veio deixar o mesmo em 2002 quando teve a quebra de morte dos pintos. Sabado vive na casa pr\u00f3pria.\r\n\r\nSabado aprendeu o negocio copiando aos amigos desde 1998. Tem um estabelecimento permanente sita na AV. Da Namaacha no bairro Mazanbanine. Exercendo atividades comerciais ha 6 anos, o estabelecimento funciona das 7:00h at\u00e9 21:00h excluindo os dias de muito movimento. Sabado tem dois empregados e tem vendido mais cerveja por 25,00mt, refresco por 10,00mt e semea por 120,00mt o saco. Sabado tem um rendimento entre 300,00mt e 1000,00mt por m\u00eas dependendo do movimento, pode ate fazer 2500,00mt por m\u00eas. Assim constitui como desafio para Sabado expandir ou manter o seu negocio.\r\n\r\nPara Sabado \u00e9 o segundo empr\u00e9stimo na Hluvuku e primeiro no Kiva e nunca teve empr\u00e9stimo em outras institui\u00e7\u00f5es. O primeiro foi de 15000,00mt com qual comprou mercadoria aumentando o seu stock. Assim com este empr\u00e9stimo Sabado quer comprar novamente mercadoria para de novo aumentar o stock e assim espera melhorar o seu negocio.\r\n\r\nO plano com o negocio daqui em diante \u00e9 abrir mais estabelecimento no bairro onde ele reside bairro 07 e futuramente ampliar os neg\u00f3cios."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":171694,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchase merchandise to increase stock.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Boane, Maputo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-26.041667 32.325278","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":"2008-06-19T22:50:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":850,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sabado Samuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-07-12T13:54:42Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":20000,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2222.22},{"due_date":"2008-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2222.22},{"due_date":"2008-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2222.22},{"due_date":"2008-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2222.22},{"due_date":"2008-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2222.22},{"due_date":"2009-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2222.22},{"due_date":"2009-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2222.22},{"due_date":"2009-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2222.22},{"due_date":"2009-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2222.24}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":94.44},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":94.44},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":94.44},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":94.44},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":94.44},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":94.44},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":94.44},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":94.44},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.48}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":95,"local_amount":2235.29,"processed_date":"2008-07-30T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T05:14:25Z","rounded_local_amount":2265.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":281242,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":95,"local_amount":2235.29,"processed_date":"2008-08-30T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-09T02:06:32Z","rounded_local_amount":2265.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":311077,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":95,"local_amount":2235.29,"processed_date":"2008-09-30T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-01T07:22:42Z","rounded_local_amount":2265.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":342182,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":92.78,"local_amount":2183.01,"processed_date":"2008-11-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T05:54:16Z","rounded_local_amount":2212.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5322621,"comment":null},{"amount":94.44,"local_amount":2222.22,"processed_date":"2008-12-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T23:12:10Z","rounded_local_amount":2252.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9941808,"comment":null},{"amount":94.44,"local_amount":2222.22,"processed_date":"2009-01-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-20T09:02:46Z","rounded_local_amount":2252.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14865418,"comment":null},{"amount":94.44,"local_amount":2222.22,"processed_date":"2009-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-03T08:20:53Z","rounded_local_amount":2252.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20407663,"comment":null},{"amount":94.44,"local_amount":2222.22,"processed_date":"2009-03-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-22T08:06:08Z","rounded_local_amount":2252.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27100574,"comment":null},{"amount":94.46,"local_amount":2222.24,"processed_date":"2009-04-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-20T08:28:04Z","rounded_local_amount":2252.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35994771,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-06-28T13:54:42Z","paid_date":"2009-05-20T08:28:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":52823,"name":"Daniel","description":{"languages":["fr"],"texts":{"fr":"Daniel A. is 29 years old, single and has no children.

Amelia","description":{"languages":["pt"],"texts":{"pt":"Sara is 41 years and she was born in the province of Maputo. She has a 23-year-old son. She moved from the Namaacha district to Boane along with her husband because of a job transfer. She supports her son and a 15-year-old stepson. They are both in school.\r\nSara completed middle school (7th grade) e did not continue her education because she got pregnant of her only son. She moved from the district of Namaacha to Boane because she got married. She met her husband while he was working in Namaacha. Nowadays, she lives in her own home in zone 7.\r\nShe has been working as a permanent retailer selling products to children out of a commercial establishment in front of a school. The store is open form 7:30am to 5:30pm and she works by herself -- her son fills in when she is absent. She learned the skills to perform this activity from friends and she has  8 years of experience now. On top of selling to the children she also sells clothing -- specially pants for 300,00mt, skirts for 250,00mt, shirts for 150,0 and dresses for 350,00mt. It has been hard to keep the business functioning for she relies on public transportation to travel to South Africa where the products are bought. Sara states that the sale of clothing generates between 750,00 and 1000,00mt, depending on the season, and the children's product sales bring in between 50,00mt and 100,00mt daily. Sara has been able to even set aside some money at the end of the month. Her challenge at this time is to expand the business. \r\nThis will be the first loan Sara requests and she has never requested loans from any other institution before. This loan will be used to purchase more merchandise (increase stock). Sara came to know about Hluvuku through a neighbor. With this loan she believes she will improve her business, although she understands that its growth will require extra dedication and sharper focus in her activity.\r\nHer plans include not only selling clothing but also selling beverages and sodas. In the future, she intends to request another loan to build a solid commercial establishment and also get married. \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Portuguese by Bertolt Cantalice, Kiva Volunteer<\/p>  \r\n\r\nSara tem 41 anos e nasceu na prov\u00edncia do Maputo. M\u00e3e de 1 filho com 23 anos de idade,  se mudou do distrito de Namaacha para Boane acompanhando o seu marido transferido pelos servi\u00e7os. Sustenta um filho mais um enteado de 15 anos, que n\u00e3o v\u00e3o para a escola. \r\n\r\nSara completou o ensino prim\u00e1rio (ate a 7a classe) e n\u00e3o continuou por ter ficada gravida do seu \u00fanico filho. Mudou-se do distrito de  Namaacha para Boane devido ao seu casamento, porque encontrou-se com o marido quando ele trabalhava em Namaacha. Hoje vive numa casa pr\u00f3pria no bairro 7.\r\n\r\nComerciante permanente desde 2000, Sara tem um estabelecimento comercial em frente da escola onde vende produtos diversos para crian\u00e7ada. Funciona das 7:30 at\u00e9 17:30, trabalha pessoalmente s\u00f3 quando esta ausente o filho \u00e9 que toma conta. Aprendeu a atividade comercial com as amigas e tem  8 anos de experi\u00eancia. Para al\u00e9m da venda de produtos para alunos tamb\u00e9m vende roupa diversa , onde destaca cal\u00e7as que vende por 300,00mt, saia por 250,00mt, blusas 150,00mt, vestidos por 350,00MT. Tem sido dif\u00edcil exercer o negocio devido ao transporte, dado que ela compra na \u00c1frica do Sul e vai de transporte publico de passageiro. Sara diz que com a venda de roupa  tem rendimentos que variam entre 750,00 a 1000,00mt, dependendo dos momentos cr\u00edticos, e pelos produtos da crian\u00e7ada tem rendimentos di\u00e1rios que variam entre 50,00mt e 100,00MT. Sara consegue poupar algum valor nos finais do m\u00eas. O desafio que tem Sara \u00e9 ampliar o seu negocio.\r\n\r\nPara Sara este \u00e9 o primeiro empr\u00e9stimo e nunca teve em nenhuma institui\u00e7\u00e3o antes. Este  empr\u00e9stimo destina-se para compra dos produtos (aumentar stock). Sara conheceu Hluvuku atrav\u00e9s do seu vizinho. Com este empr\u00e9stimo acha que vai melhorar o seu negocio mesmo reconhecendo que o crescimento exigira mais dedica\u00e7\u00e3o e seriedade na sua atividade.\r\n\r\nTem como plano para al\u00e9m de vender roupa vender bebidas e refrigerantes e futuramente pretende pedir mais empr\u00e9stimo para construir um estabelecimento fixo e casar-se."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":171702,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase

Jeremias","description":{"languages":["pt"],"texts":{"pt":"Luis is 36 years old and he was born in the province of Maputo, in the district of Boane. Luis is single and father of 4 children with ages ranging between 4 and 15 years old. They are all in school. Besides his children he also supports his mother and father -- both live with him. \r\n\r\nLuis went to school until the 5th grade and he says he did not continue due to financial hardship his family encountered and the civil war in Mozambique. The war caused the family to flee to the neighboring country Swaziland. Today Luis lives in his own home located at the 14th kilometer in Boane. \r\n\r\nLuis is a construction worker and a retailer since 2003 and, gradually, he has been taking over the family's business. He learned how to be a construction worker in Swaziland, and he learned how to be a retailer with friends by selling cookies and sheets around town. He has been doing this for 5 years. The best selling products are sugar, sold for 23,00 MT per kilo, and peanuts for 35,00 MT per kilo. Running his business is difficult because he gets the products in the city of Maputo once a week by public transportation. He generates 300,00 Mt daily and 2.100,00 Mt weekly which amounts to approximately 9.000,00 monthly. Luis has not been able to save any money because he invests largely into the business. The challenge to increase business volume and maintain it moving along is to have enough merchandise and good customer service. \r\n\r\nThis is Luis' second loan. The first one was in the amount of 15000,00 Mt and it was used to purchase basic need products which triggered business expansion. Luis has never requested loans from any other institution. He found out about Hluvuku through friends and made contact with it to request his first loan. This second loan will be used to purchase additional merchandise to beef up stock and, therefore, improve business performance. \r\n\r\nLuis' plans include fostering business growth and, in the future, he intends to request another loan to further expand this venture. \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Portuguese by Bertolt Cantalice, Kiva Volunteer<\/p>\r\n\r\nLuis tem 36 anos de idade e nasceu na prov\u00edncia de Maputo no distrito de Boane. Luis \u00e9  solteiro e pai de 4 filhos com idade variando entre 15 anos o mais velho e 4 anos o mais novo. Todos v\u00e3o a escola. Para alem dos seus filhos sustenta a sua m\u00e3e e seu pai que vivem com eles na mesma casa.\r\n\r\nLuis estudou apenas at\u00e9 5\u00aaClasse e diz que n\u00e3o continuou por dif\u00edcil situa\u00e7\u00e3o financeira da fam\u00edlia e devido a guerra civil de Mo\u00e7ambique, que fez a fam\u00edlia abandonar a zona para o pais vizinho Swazilandia. Hoje Luis vive na casa pr\u00f3pria no Km 14 em Boane.\r\n\r\nLuis \u00e9 pedreiro e comerciante permanente desde 2003 e vem assumindo na integra a quest\u00e3o de negocio da fam\u00edlia. Aprendeu na Swazilandia a ser pedreiro, e com os amigos a ser comerciante, vendendo biscoitos e mantas  na zona. Fazem 5 anos que se dedica ao negocio. Os produtos com destaque \u00e9 a\u00e7\u00facar que vende o kg por 23,00mt e amendoim por 35,00mt o kg. A sua atividade \u00e9 um pouco dif\u00edcil por que os produtos adquire na cidade de Maputo e vai dos transporte p\u00fablicos uma vez por semana. Tem rendimentos di\u00e1rios entre 300,00mt e 2.100,00mt semanais e aproximadamente 9.000,00mt mensal. Luis n\u00e3o consegue poupar algo por que a tend\u00eancia \u00e9 investir mais no negocio. O desafio para aumentar ou manter o seu negocio ser\u00e1 ter sempre mercadoria e um bom atendimento aos clientes.\r\n\r\nEste \u00e9 o segundo empr\u00e9stimo para Luis onde o primeiro foi de 15000,00mt que usou para compra de produtos da primeira necessidade ampliando assim o seu negocio. Luis nunca levantou empr\u00e9stimo noutras institui\u00e7\u00f5es. Conheceu a Hluvuku atrav\u00e9s dos amigos e assim contactou e solicitou o seu primeiro empr\u00e9stimo. Este segundo empr\u00e9stimo Luis usara para compra de mercadoria para aumentar o stock para melhorar assim o seu negocio.\r\n\r\nLuis tem como planos fazer crescer mais o seu negocio e futuramente pretende solicitar outro empr\u00e9stimo para ampliar o seu negocio."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":171707,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchase

Magreth Lwambano is 38 years old, is married, and has four children between the ages of 3 and 12. She has two dependents, who live with her because they are orphans. In 2007, Magreth began her poultry business. She operates her business 7 days a week and 16 hours a day. Her husband assists her in the business. \r\n<P>Raising kuku is a popular micro-business in Tanzania, especially among SELFINA clients. In fact, if you are a regular lender on kiva.org, you may be tired of reading about kuku. Kuku means chickens in Swahili, and raising them for sale is popular for a number of reasons. \r\n<P>First, they require little start-up capital. You can start with one or two kuku, and add to them as you go, or wait for them to multiple naturally! Second, they require little space, so sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. Third, while they are growing, they produce eggs that can  be sold to provide a supplementary source of income, or eaten to provide another source of protein.

Only eight of the members finished their schooling, the rest of the group sadly learned to read and write only at a very basic level. It has been a dream for them to enroll in a school for adults to finish their education but at the moment they lack the necessary resources to do it. The majority of the members are mainly dedicated to the sale of fruits and vegetables on the distinct city streets of El Alto. With winter here, the prices for these products tend to rise as a result of frosts on the plantations. It's for this reason they needed to reinforce their capital to acquire their goods, which they do every two weeks. They also want to be able to rent or buy sales posts in the city markets to ensure their sales and better preserve their products. In this way they'll be able to increase their earnings and be able to afford going to school and give their families a better quality of life.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein,

Their house is located in the eastern zone of the province in a neighborhood called Alfredo Vaca. Medardo is a full-time bricklayer and part-time motorcycle taxi driver. He has a great deal of experience in both fields. He has medium competition because of the amount of bricklayers and motorcycle taxi drivers that exist in the community, but since there is a demand for both, there is always work available. Merdardo has been planning on purchasing a refrigerator with the loan as well as goods that his wife can sell during her free time. She currently works sweeping streets, but they only had enough money for their second goal. This is Medardo\u2019s third loan request with the institution, and he has demonstrated to be a punctual and responsible member. He currently has another debt with a different institution. \r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by Elizabeth Casian, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nSalustiano Medardo cuenta con 34 a\u00f1os de edad y vive en casa propia junto a su esposa de 37 a\u00f1os y sus tres hijos de 12, 10 y 8 a\u00f1os de edad. La casa se encuentra ubicada en la zona este de la provincia en un barrio denominado Alfredo Vaca. Medardo es alba\u00f1il y desempe\u00f1a en este rubro a tiempo completo y en sus momentos libres se dedica al transporte p\u00fablico urbano en su moto taxi. En ambos rubro tiene bastante experiencia. La competencia es de nivel medio, debido a la cantidad de alba\u00f1iles y mototaxistas que hay en la comunidad, pero debido a la demanda que existe no le falta trabajo. Medardo ten\u00eda previsto comprar una heladera con el prestamo y tambi\u00e9n mercader\u00eda de abarrotes para que su esposa pueda vender en sus momentos libres, ya que ella actualmente trabaja barriendo las calles, pero el dinero s\u00f3lo alcanz\u00f3 para el segundo objeto. Esta es la tercera frecuencia de Medardo con la instituci\u00f3n y en el tiempo que trabajo en la misma demostr\u00f3 puntualidad y responsabilidad.

These women are all mothers from the remote highland village of San Jose Chacaya. They are mainly dedicated to raising livestock and planting\/sowing agricultural products. Others dedicate their lives to making and selling food, and administrating fruit stands and a small grocery store. \r\n<P>These women are openly very happy with their hometown. The general feeling is that they like the sense of community in their town and its citizens' latent desire to grow and prosper. Silvia Feliciana P. P. pointed out how much they enjoyed dancing or watching people dance at the yearly fair, which brings the entire town together in the church\u2019s central square. Events like the fair are the ones for which the credit proves most helpful, allowing them to stock up in order to maximize profits during these periods of condensed sales.\r\n<P>They unanimously made a point of mentioning how thankful they are of the possibility of receiving these \u201cvery helpful\u201d loans that allow their microenterprises to \u201cgo very well,\u201d as Maria R. A. expressed. She went on to say that they feel a sense of empowerment when receiving the funds, a kind of responsibility to do something bigger than ever before with it, and prove to their group and, most importantly, their family, that they can pay back the money. They unanimously agreed as well that it was relatively easy to pay back the money. In addition, they all enjoy meeting with their communal bank, which not only allows them to support each other mutually in repaying loans, but provides a few fun social hours every month.\r\n<P>\u201cWithout this money, it is impossible to overcome,\u201d stated Natalia T.. She mentioned the barriers of the cycles of steady profits and expenses, but the drowning and constant increases in costs of living that keep their businesses at such a minimal size. Reliable microloans allow them to overcome these barriers. \r\n<P>Their ultimate investment goal is growth, which will lead to money, which will allow them and their children to live comfortable lives, despite today\u2019s unprecedented costs of living.  The fact that every one of these mothers sends her children to public school is proof of their claims of dedication to the family. They send all of their children to school despite the large expenses and the need for labor at the business. Esperanza Juliana started receiving small loans when she was a mobile sweets and chips vendor, and today, she requests and consistently repays 400 USD and higher to purchase wholesale items for her well-established store, while sending her two girls to school. Natalia T. passes house to house selling from two large (head carried) baskets tamales, rice, beans, and atol de platano, some of which she grows on her own fields with the help of her husband. She brings her children along to help if they are not in school.\r\n<P>Increased profits from growing more vegetables, buying wholesale to supply larger family stores or investing in buying and raising more livestock at once are the economic benefits which keep these mothers consistently pay off and return for more loans. This dedication holds as an ultimate goal to lift their children to a higher starting platform by paying for their schooling successfully and providing them with adequate health care. It seems that their children, their ultimate pride, are a reflection of their own life, and through these loans they choose to better their children\u2019s lives, making up for the hardships that they have had to live through."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4975,"image":{"id":171930,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Most of these women either own a weaving business or a daily consumption store. The women of this group know one and other quite well from their San Juan La Laguna community and expressed determination to prove themselves to their families, their group members, and their microlenders. They were content with being part of a community of \u201cunited women without envy of each other\u201d as Cecilia C. V. put it. \r\n<P>There was consensus that the loans were going to be easy to repay. These loans would allow them primarily to invest in their business for higher future profit. Most women in the weaving industry create guipiles and cortes, the traditional indigenous outfits, to sell in the upcoming June 23rd town fair. Seven of them needed funds to invest in their stores which they hoped to set up near the fair. With more products to sell at once, their profits can be much larger during the peak sales of the festive season. They organized this meeting early precisely because of their hopes to receive their loans before the fair. \r\n<P>Melchora Isabel C. owns a traditional clothing store which focuses on sales to tourists. Thanks to her credit, she has been able to produce enough textiles to sell to an intermediary American friend, who exports to the USA. She hires friends to maintain her production rate and allow her time to continue to study in hopes of achieving the equivalent of a high-school degree. \r\n<P>She, along with five others of this new group, stood out as confident role models who began six years ago with loans of 40 USD and are now receiving loans of up to 400 USD. Most of them are in leadership positions such as group president or secretary. Iris Yolanda I. began without any business whatsoever, and is now the proud owner and manager of a crafts and textile business. Cecilia C. now travels to well-known Antigua, Guatemala, to sell the hammocks she makes in large amounts with the help of the loans. \r\n<P>The primary vision that these dedicated businesswomen share is to provide their children with the clothing, food, and education necessary for them to \u201chave it better off than they did as children\u201d and to go on into their adult life with a head start, as Cecilia C. expressed. Alicia C. Y. emphasized the need for this type of individual effort aided by the loans to collectively help their entire town, region, and soon country, prosper."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4850,"image":{"id":171969,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"Wholesale purchase of market items.

Living in a rural area with agricultural tradition, Mr. Nguyen Kham Hoa, her husband, always encouraged her to used borrowed money to improve family economy. At first, she used 200 USD in breeding pigs. Their advantage was that they had a big yard. Since breeding pigs, she saved a small area of her yard for gardening, planting a variety of vegetables. Therefore, they did not have to spend too much money in feeding the pigs. Seeing that combining breeding and gardening is very productive, they spend time in doing those. Mrs. T. has 5 children, 4 of whom are going to school. Her oldest child is working and earns 100 USD\/month. This time, she wants to borrow 625 USD to invest in breeding pigs.

After gaining the necessary knowledge and training in this field, she and her husband were determined to invest some money in opening a salon, with the advantage of being right in town and accessible to the local townspeople.  After a short time her salon had become the destination for many brides and grooms in town.  As the business grew, their salon also expanded in size.  She has one child who is still in school.

Thi Tran has been a participant with the Fund since 2000.  Before joining the Fund the family\u2019s income depended mainly on working the fields.  After joining the Fund, Ms. Tran has discussed with her family regarding using the loans to invest in retail businesses and opening a restaurant to serve the people in the neighborhood.  Ms. T.\u2019s house is in the center of the town, so she has many advantages in business endeavors.  Everyday her husband goes to buy food from large retailers for her resell and serve the customers.  Thanks to her husband\u2019s help and her determination, the business has improved and become more stable day by day.  Since receiving more income from the business, she has saved up money and built a nice 2-story house and bought some other conveniences for the family.  In this round of funding Ms. Tran would like to borrow 10,000,000 VND to invest more in the store to better serve the customers, increase profit, improve the family\u2019s income, and provide for her two children to attend school.

Thi Vu, 31 years old, has been participating in the Fund for 9 years.  Before joining the Fund she worked in the fields like many other women in the region.  In 1999, she started planning with her husband to join the Fund for seed money to go into business and improve their family\u2019s finances.  Everyday her husband uses the money borrowed to go buy baby pigs in town and surrounding areas to sell to retailers with freezers.  Mrs. Vu buys wheat from farmers and resell it to processors who grind the wheat.  In the first few funding rounds, since they were new to their respective businesses, the couple only borrowed a small amount.  After some time the couple became familiar with their businesses and bravely increased their loan amounts.  The businesses have increased the family\u2019s income day by day; currently the family\u2019s income ranges from 3,500,000 VND to 4,500,000 VND per month.  Thanks to this improvement the children are better off in their daily lives and their schooling.  Mrs. Vu would like to borrow 10,000,000 VND to buy more stock for her business without having to pay a high interest rate with credit.  \r\n<p><b>Translated from Vietnamese by Chi Nguyen, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nCh\u1ecb V\u0169 Th\u1ecb Tuy\u1ebft n\u0103m nay 31 tu\u1ed5i v\u00e0 \u0111\u00e3 tham gia v\u00e0o Qu\u1ef9 T\u00ecnh th\u01b0\u01a1ng \u0111\u01b0\u1ee3c 9 n\u0103m.Tr\u01b0\u1edbc khi tham gia v\u00e0o Qu\u1ef9 t\u00ecnh th\u01b0\u01a1ng ch\u1ecb ch\u1ec9 l\u00e0m ru\u1ed9ng nh\u01b0 bao ng\u01b0\u1eddi ph\u1ee5 n\u1eef kh\u00e1c t\u1ea1i \u0111\u1ecba ph\u01b0\u01a1ng.

Before, she and her husband took building materials to other areas to sell. However, this activity required them to be away from home, making it difficult to take care of their children who were still going to school. In 2005, she joined the TYM Fund. She sold her boat and combined the profit with the borrowed money to sell coals to local people. Because of her experience in selling building materials, she uses the borrowed money effectively. Every day, Mrs. D. and her husband buy coals from wholesale people, then sell it to local people. Her income from this activity is approximately 200 USD\/ month.

She has 2 children who are still going to school.  Before joining TYM FUND (Kiva Partner in Vietnam), her family as well as other families in the village earned their living mostly by farming.  They might also knit hats and gloves to earn some extra income.  In 2004, Mrs. H. decided to join TYM Fund to take a loan and invest in some business.  She saw that there was a demand for fuel, she decided to open a store selling charcoal.  Mrs. H. is good at taking the opportunities.  Thus, her business is doing very well.  Her children are given a good education.  Besides this business, her family also takes order to make hats from other retailers in the village.  Mrs. H.'s family has a current monthly income of 4 000 000 VND (around 250 USD).  This loan cycle, she would like to borrow 15 000 000 VND (925 USD) to continue to invest on her business.

In her first loan, she borrowed 2 million VND to invest in breeding pigs and poultry and profit almost 1.2 millions VND.  After searching around, she realized that putting money into producing wine also make big profit so that were the focus of later loan cycles.  Apart from selling wine to local area, the left over ingredient (after making the wine) can be used as food-stuff for their breeding pigs.  Hard work evidently paid off as her family's total earning monthly is about 3 millions VND.

She has a family with four school-aged children. Before joining the TYM Fund, her family experienced many hardships because of her large family. Their income from raising livestock and cultivating plants was not enough to pay for their living. \r\n\r\n<p>In 2002, Ch\u1ecb T. joined the fund and her first loan request was for 3,000,000 VND to put more money into raising livestock for an income of 2,000,000 VND. Yet, she saw that raising livestock only helped to relieve some of her family\u2019s hardships and couldn\u2019t help them escape poverty. Therefore, after becoming more familiar with the fund\u2019s lending process, she and her husband requested a larger loan to buy a tractor pulled plough and grain harvesting machine. They rent out the equipment according to the seasons. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Outside of their rental business, her husband is a construction worker and she continues to raise livestock and cultivate plants. Their family\u2019s financial situation continues to improve because of their business-mindedness. They have a monthly income of about 4,000,000 VND. Ch\u1ecb T. and her husband have been able to purchase personal items for their family and put money towards raising their children and helping them get an education. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>They currently want to raise another 12,000,000 VND to invest in raising their livestock and to purchase engine oil for the upcoming harvesting season.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Vietnamese by Catherine Tran, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><\/p>\r\n\r\nCh\u1ecb Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb T. n\u0103m nay 29 tu\u1ed5i,  hi\u1ec7n gia \u0111\u00ecnh  ch\u1ecb c\u00f3 4 con \u0111ang tu\u1ed5i \u0111i h\u1ecdc.

Thi Nguyen is 47 years old and has 3 children, one of which is still in school.  Before joining the Fund her family worked as manufacturing technicians, both she and her husband had strong professional experience.  However, due to a lack of capital to buy raw materials for manufacturing, the family\u2019s income was not very good.  In 2006, she joined the Fund and borrowed 300,000 VND in the first round of funding.  With this money, the family bought equipment and invested in the factory, resulting in an income of 3,000,000 VND per month.  Besides the income from the factory, her two grown children also work and help their parents.  Therefore, the family\u2019s finances are improving day by day.  In the coming round of funding, she is requesting 9,000,000 VND to invest in buying more iron and other raw materials for use in the manufacturing activities by the family.  \r\n<p><b>Translated from Vietnamese by Chi Nguyen, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nCh\u1ecb Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb C\u1ea3nh  n\u0103m nay  47 tu\u1ed5i, gia \u0111\u00ecnh ch\u1ecb c\u00f3 3 con trong \u0111\u00f3 c\u00f3 1 con \u0111ang trong \u0111\u1ed9 tu\u1ed5i \u0111i h\u1ecdc.

Thi Nguyen is 26 years old.  She has one 3-year-old son.  Before joining the Fund, both she and her husband worked as hired hands for a candle factory.  Due to the unstable jobs, the family\u2019s life was very difficult.  In 2006, with the experience gained from working at the factory and with the determination to rise up in their lives, the couple discussed and decided to join the Fund to open their own candle factory.  Thanks to their family\u2019s support, the couple was able to establish and open their own factory.  Currently, she has a factory with 7 candlemaking machines and 3 employees.  Because she knows how to run a business well, the family\u2019s finances have improved and stabilized, with an average income of 4,500,000 VND per month.  In this round of funding she is requesting 9,000,000 VND to buy more molds for candles to supply the market.  The remainder of the loan will be used to buy more feedstock materials for the factory.  \r\n<p><b>Translated from Vietnamese by Chi Nguyen, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nCh\u1ecb Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb T. n\u0103m nay 26 tu\u1ed5i.

After 11 years old membership, her family economy has improved a great deal. At first, she borrowed 80 USD to invest in raising pigs. Then, she decided to buy rice-husking machine because she realized that combining both activities would be more effective. She could use the remaining, unwanted rice to feed the pigsAlso, the rice-husking machine would be a great assistance to the local people. Currently, she has 5 pigs. Her two children are still going to school. This time, she wants to borrow 1100 USD to fix the machines and to invest in breeding animals. Her average income is 225 USD\/month. \r\n<p><b>Translated from Vietnamese by Duy Hua, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\u1ede tu\u1ed5i 42 nh\u01b0ng nh\u00ecn ch\u1ecb Tr\u1ea7n Th\u1ecb Th\u1eafm c\u00f2n r\u1ea5t tr\u1ebb, T. gia Qu\u1ef9 n\u0103m 1997.

When she first joined the TYM Fund, she borrowed 200 USD and invest in breeding pigs and small retail. Then, she started saving money and was able to open a small woodshop. Their hard work and clever hands earned them more income. Currently, her family income is 200 USD\/month. She wants to borrow 550 USD to buy more wood and expand the workshop.

Thi Nguyen is 44 years old.  Her famiL. includes three children, one grown daughter and two school-aged children.  Before joining the Fund the famiL. depended on income from raising livestock and farming, ventures in which there were no shortage of difficulties.  In 2006, Mrs. Nguyen joined the Fund.  With receipt of the first loan, she invested in renovating the livestock pens and buying more pigs to raise.  Her husband works as a construction worker to supplement the famiL.\u2019s income.  Thanks to the livestock business doing well, and thanks to the extra income from her husband, the famiL.\u2019s income has reached 3,500,000 VND per month.  To buy more sows for breeding and more wheat for use as livestock feed, she hopes to receive the requested loan of 9,000,000 VND.  \r\n<p><b>Translated from Vietnamese by Chi Nguyen, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nCh\u1ecb Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb L\u00fd n\u0103m nay 44 tu\u1ed5i.

Thi Thai is 58 years old.  Her family includes three grown children who have started their own families.  Joining the Fund in the beginning of 2007, she borrowed 3,000,000 VND to invest in the family\u2019s business of making pots for landscape and garden use.  The varieties of landscape pots that the family brings to market are always loved by the customers, so their revenue stream is very stable.  Besides the income from the manufacturing and selling of the pots, the family also has an income from her husband\u2019s pension which makes the family\u2019s finances even more stable.  To expand the manufacturing operations and create more jobs for the people in town and her own children, Mrs. Thai is requesting to borrow 9,000,000 VND.  The family\u2019s income is 7,000,000 VND per month.  \r\n<p><b>Translated from Vietnamese by Chi Nguyen, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nCh\u1ecb Th\u00e1i Th\u1ecb H\u1ed3ng n\u0103m nay 58 tu\u1ed5i.

She is frequently able to predict the market\u2019s demands in each time period, so the task of investing in certain goods is constant changing.

Thi Nguyen, 50 years old, has gone through four rounds of funding.  Her family\u2019s finances have improved markedly, resulting from the bold move to invest in raising livestock and expanding the livestock operations.  In the first round of funding, not yet familiar with the weekly repayment structure, the family borrowed a very conservative amount of 2,000,000 VND.  After seeing that the method of weekly repayment fit their needs well, in subsequent rounds of funding Mrs. Nguyen consistently borrowed higher amounts.  Her experience in the keeping of livestock also improved with time, so the family did not encounter many difficulties in this business.  Mrs. Nguyen and her husband has 3 children, one of which is grown and 2 still live at home.  The grown child has found work that pays 2,000,000 VND a month.  In this round of funding the family is requesting 15,000,000 VND to invest in pigs and fixing up the pens.  Their total income is 4,000,000 VND per month.  \r\n<p><b>Translated from Vietnamese by Chi Nguyen, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nTham gia v\u00e0o Qu\u1ef9 n\u0103m 2004, Ch\u1ecb Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb Li\u1ec5u 50 tu\u1ed5i, tr\u1ea3i qua 4 v\u00f2ng v\u1ed1n vay c\u1ee7a Qu\u1ef9 kinh t\u1ebf gia \u0111\u00ecnh ch\u1ecb \u0111\u00e3 thay \u0111\u1ed5i r\u00f5 r\u1ec7t, t\u1eeb suy ngh\u0129 m\u1ea1nh gi\u1ea1n vay v\u1ed1n v\u1ec1 \u0111\u1ea7u t\u01b0 ch\u0103n nu\u00f4i v\u00e0 m\u1edf r\u1ed9ng m\u00f4 h\u00ecnh ch\u0103n nu\u00f4i, v\u00f2ng v\u1ed1n \u0111\u1ea7u ti\u00ean do ch\u01b0a quen v\u1edbi ph\u01b0\u01a1ng th\u1ee9c tr\u1ea3 tu\u1ea7n n\u00ean gia \u0111\u00ecnh ch\u1ecb vay m\u1ee9c r\u1ea5t khi\u00eam t\u1ed1n l\u00e0 2.000.000\u0111.

Thi Nguyen, 51 years old, joined the Fund in 2007.  She runs a business that her family has ran for more than 10 years, a restaurant.  She is very proud when speaking about her restaurant; when customers visit it even once, they want to come back to her restaurant again.  Not only are the food fresh and clean, but the family\u2019s service is also very friendly and attentive with their customers.  When leaving the restaurants customers always receive a smile and thanks from Mrs. Nguyen.  Because of these points, her family\u2019s restaurant is always busy and full of diners, and is also the number one eatery in the area.  Mrs. Nguyen and her husband have two children, one who is still in school, and one who is grown and help out at the restaurant.  Continuing to invest in their restaurant, in this round of funding the family is requesting 7,000,000 VND.  Their monthly income is 5,000,000 VND.  \r\nTranslated from Vietnamese by Chi Nguyen, Kiva volunteer.\r\nTham gia v\u00e0o Qu\u1ef9 n\u0103m 2007, ch\u1ecb Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb L. 51 tu\u1ed5i v\u1edbi m\u1ed9t m\u00f4 h\u00ecnh kinh doanh m\u00e0 gia \u0111\u00ecnh ch\u1ecb \u0111\u00e3 l\u00e0m tr\u00ean 10 n\u0103m nay \u0111\u00f3 l\u00e0 kinh doanh h\u00e0ng \u0103n.

She has a very difficult life: her husband passed away, and she was taking care of 4 children by herself. She is very hard-working and self-motivated. Her children are now grown-up, working and building their own families. Living in rural area, her income is mainly from agricultural activities and breeding animals. Joining the TYM Fund, she is able to borrow money and use it in breeding animals. Therefore, she is now having a fair amount of saving money to help her children. Her children also come to assist her with her agricultural works. Her income is 100 USD\/month. This time, she wants to borrow 550 USD to invest in breeding pigs and chickens. \r\n<p><b>Translated from Vietnamese by Duy Hua, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nCh\u1ecb Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb Tuy\u1ebft 57 tu\u1ed5i, tham gia v\u00e0o Qu\u1ef9 n\u0103m 2004 v\u1edbi ho\u00e0n c\u1ea3nh v\u1ea5t v\u1ea3 ch\u1ed3ng m\u1ea5t s\u1edbm, b\u1ea3n th\u00e2n ch\u1ecb g\u00e1nh v\u00e1c t\u1ea5t c\u1ea3 c\u00f4ng vi\u1ec7c gia \u0111\u00ecnh v\u00e0 nu\u00f4i 4 ng\u01b0\u1eddi con.

She has 4 children, 2 of whom are working and the other 2 are still going to school. To be able to fulfil her children\u2019 needs for school supplies, she and her husband have to cut down on their living costs. In 1999, she talked to her husband and decided to join the TYM Fund and borrow money. At first, she used the borrowed money to breed animals. However, breeding animals did not bring her much profit while she had to spend money to buy food for them. After researching about the local\u2019s need, she decided to borrow money to invest in making tofu. This activity brought her profit. They could also feed the pigs from the remaining tofu. Their family economy becomes stable through time. Currently, her husband and children are responsible for making the tofu at home and she does the selling process. Their average income is approximately 200 USD\/month. This time, she wants to borrow 625 USD to buy more tofu-making machines. \r\n<p><b>Translated from Vietnamese by Duy Hua, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nCh\u1ecb Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb Q. n\u0103m nay 50 tu\u1ed5i. hai v\u1ee3 ch\u1ed3ng ch\u1ecb \u0111\u1ec1u l\u00e0 c\u00e1n b\u1ed9 h\u01b0u tr\u00ed v\u00ec th\u1ebf \u0111\u1ec1u c\u00f3 thu nh\u1eadp t\u1eeb l\u01b0\u01a1ng h\u01b0u.
