She is married to Remigio who is a master builder. She lives in the company of her husband and their 19 and 12 year old children living comfortably in their own house. Maria's business is renting out rooms, which she has built in her own house, starting with a total of 4 rooms three years ago with a loan from MFP. They saw the economic need and, based on an idea of her husband's, they decided to start their business with only her dedicated to the care and collection of the rent. She likes her business since it doesn't take up too much time and the rest she can use for other activities as well as for the demand her rooms have by young students and single people so they are always occupied and she has a constant stream of income. Seeing this demand, she has plans to expand her business and build at least 3 additional rooms so she can earn more and maintain her spending needs for her old age. This will be her tenth loan with the MFP institution and she hope to continue with her objectives with this collaboration. She also notes that she feels good with her community bank since she considers the members to be good people. With the loan requested of 1500 new \"soles\" she will invest in the purchase of wood and strips to build at least 3 additional rooms."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":193.5,"image":{"id":954372,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Property","sector":"Housing","use":"to purchase wood and strips of wood for the building of more rooms.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-12-22T04:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":163.03},{"due_date":"2012-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":173.17},{"due_date":"2012-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":168.57},{"due_date":"2012-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":185.92},{"due_date":"2012-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":192.85},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":194.18},{"due_date":"2012-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":207.28},{"due_date":"2012-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":215}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.49},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.39},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.62},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.26},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.93},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.44},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.45},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":62.49,"local_amount":163.03,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:50:25Z","rounded_local_amount":168.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250836368,"comment":null},{"amount":66.39,"local_amount":173.17,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:17:52Z","rounded_local_amount":178.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257246154,"comment":null},{"amount":64.62,"local_amount":168.57,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:31:26Z","rounded_local_amount":174.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263386170,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-12-24T15:21:59Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":373535,"name":"Sandra Isabel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Se\u00f1ora Sandra es socia del banco comunal Nueva Juventud, vive en la ciudad de Cuenca, esta ciudad es desde diciembre de 1999 patrimonio cultural de la humanidad, cuenta con una gran belleza, riqueza natural y cultural, su gente es amable, cordial, mantienen la cultura y tradiciones de sus pueblos.\n\nLa Se\u00f1ora.

That work was very difficult for Ang\u00e9lica but she liked to do it with enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nAng\u00e9lica stopped working for other people and decided to start her own life project.  She set up a grocery store and bookstore in her own home where she would be able to work and own her own business.  This business is her source of income as she says that she no longer has the youth and energy that she used to have years ago.  She would like to buy groceries, dairy products, tortillas, soft drinks, Bibles and cassettes so that her business is stocked with merchandise."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":33.62,"image":{"id":954600,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy groceries, dairy goods, Bibles, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Acuna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"29.3 -100.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":18,"posted_date":"2011-12-22T12:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Angelica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":8489.47,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":456.73},{"due_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":491.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":529.28},{"due_date":"2012-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":569.77},{"due_date":"2012-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":613.35},{"due_date":"2012-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":660.27},{"due_date":"2012-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":710.78},{"due_date":"2012-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":765.15},{"due_date":"2012-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":823.69},{"due_date":"2012-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":886.7},{"due_date":"2012-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":954.53},{"due_date":"2013-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1027.55}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.62},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.2},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.97},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.94},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.16},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.61},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.64},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.28},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.27},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":33.62,"local_amount":456.73,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-17T07:41:19Z","rounded_local_amount":467.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263704762,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-12-23T06:36:56Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":373557,"name":"Juan Jesus","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Juan Jesus es hombre muy trabajador y dedicado, hace 15 a\u00f1os por situaciones ajenas a el, perdi\u00f3 algunos dientes y desde ese tiempo se ha cuidado de no abrir tanto la boca cuando habla y hasta para reir por la pena de que alguien se burle de su estado.

Kyrgyzstan.  Similar to many families living in the rural areas, Ainagul and her husband are raising livestock, which they have started in 2009. Currently Ainagul owns 10 sheep and 1 horse.

is 41-year-old Hawa.  She is married to a businessman and has 4 children, aged 21, 19, 17 and 15 years. In 2006, Hawa established her pure drinking water and drinks business. She began her business because her parent did not see it necessary for a girl child to go to school. Instead, she was sent into early marriage at the age of 15 and since then she decided to go into business. \r\n\r\nWorking 7 days a week and 16 hours a day, Hawa earns about Le 2,076,000 every month from this business. She would like a loan in the amount of Le 4,500,000.  Hawa has already received and successfully repaid 1 loan, and now requires a new loan in order to buy spring water (50 bundles at Le 25,000), luvian pure water (50 bundles @ Le 25,000), luvian water packets (58 packets of 1 litres @ Le 15,000), and magram (30 packets of 1.5 litres  @ Le 25,000).  The balance 380,000 is to be used for transportation.  \r\n\r\nHawa hopes that this loan will enable her to increase her monthly profits by approximately Le 416,000. In the future, she plans to give a quality education to her children, build a house, and have a bigger shop.  She felt good about taking this loan, which will help her to develop her business and generate more income.  A major challenge for her is the rise in cost and the scarcity in the supply of goods, which are so since several people are dealing in this product.  \r\n\r\nHawa always goes for the best that makes her business different  She serves 20 customers each day.  Her business is popular because she knows how to interact with customers and the items are used by the majority of people.  She treats her customers fairly and gives them the best of their demand.  She has one shop attendance.  She usually go for her supplies in Freetown three times each month by public transport.  She saves the profit she makes from the business.  She is hard working and honest.

Animal husbandry business, started by Arslanbek in 2010, is the family's primary source of income.  Thanks to his tenacity and persistence, his business now has three cows and ten sheep and yields about 10,000 som (KGS) per month from sales of dairy and meat products.  In order to further increase livestock headcount, Arslanbek requested a loan in the sum of 60,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to purchase sheep for fattening up.

She began her business because she became pregnant when she was in school and after given birth, her parents refused support her.  Her fianc\u00e9e gave her some money to start selling food and from then the business has grown to this day.  \r\n\r\nWorking 7 days a week and 10 hours a day, Zainab earns about Le 1,874,600 every month from this business. She would like a loan in the amount of Le 4,500,000.  Zainab has already received and successfully repaid 2 loans, and now requires a new loan in order to buy the following: tomato paste (30 cartons @ Le36,000), onions (10 bags @ Le100,000), vegetable oil (8 containers @ Le140,000), Maggie (6 cartons @ Le160,000), bottled water (2 bundles @ Le120,000).  The balance will be use to pay labourers.  \r\n\r\nZainab hopes that this loan will enable her to increase her monthly profits by approximately Le 374,920.  In the future, she plans to build a house and a shop, and educate her children to tertiary level.  She feels happy about taking this loan since it will help to improve her business.  Her major challenge is the weather, especially during the rains.  She only has one umbrella.  Her business is so popular because the items are use by the majority of people every day.  Her suppliers are in Freetown and she transports her items by public vehicle twice a month.  She ploughs some of her profit back into the business and keeps the balance to make her loan repayments.  She plans to expand her business and believes this can be achieved by proper utilization of her capital and profit.  She is hard-working and honest.

She is married to a mechanic & businessman, and has 3 children, aged 13 years, 4 years, and 4 months.  Two of her children are going to school.   \r\n\r\nIn 2008, Wulaymatu established her business selling baby diapers, pants, towels, babywear and wrappers.  She began her business because when her father died she was brought up by her stepmother who did not think it wise to see her through school.  She taught herself this business, which has been her source of income ever since.  Working 7 days a week and 10 hours a day, she earns about Le 1,961,000 every month from her business. \r\n\r\nWulaymatu would like a loan in the amount of Le 4,000,000.  She has already received and successfully repaid 1 previous loan, and now requires a new loan in order to buy children's jeans (2 dozens @ Le400,000), jeans skirts (2 dozen @ Le450,000), babywear (4 dozen @ Le250,000),  and blouses (3 dozens @ Le300,000).  The balance of 400,000 will be used for transport and other costs.   She hopes that this loan will enable her to increase her monthly profits by approximately Le 490,000. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Wulaymatu plans to open a well-secured shop where she can display her large stock.  She also wants to build a house and give her children a good education. She hopes to access more help in terms of loans for her business, as it is her only source of generating income.  The rain  is a major factor for her because her stall is not well covered.  The competition is high, but she always has a regular supply of goods that customers demand.  She serves people around the town, about 20 per day.  She treats her customers fairly and respects their wishes.

She is married to a driver and has two children, ages 31 and 28 years old. Her parents gave her to an aunt at the age of 5 to be taken care of, but her aunt's husband would not allow a girl child to attend school. They were business people; therefore, they introduced her to business. After she fully matured, she got married and started working on her own business.\r\n\r\nIn 1991, Kadiatu established a rice and palm oil business. Her suppliers are located in Freetown and Makeni. She transports her items by public vehicle and she buys her stock twice a month. Working 7 days a week and 12 hours a day, she earns about 1,413,600 leones (SLL) every month from this business. Her challenges are limited capital to buy more stock and fluctuation in foreign currency. Competition is high, but what makes her different from her competitors is that those who keep their business with her store buy more from her. She serves ten customers each day. Her business is popular because of good customer service.  \r\n\r\nKadiatu would like a loan in the amount of 4,000,000 SLL. Kadiatu has already received and successfully repaid one loan, and now requires a new loan in order to buy the following items: Indian rice (15 bags @ 152,000 SLL) and American rice (11 bags @ 145,000 SLL). The remaining 125,000 SLL will be used for transport. Kadiatu hopes that this loan will enable her to increase her monthly profits by approximately 2,827,200 SLL. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Kadiatu plans to build a house for her children. She feels good about taking this loan, because she will earn more income. This loan will help her to improve the business. She will plough back her profits into the business. Kadiatu is planning to expand and this can be accomplished through adequate utilization of her capital. She is hardworking and honest.

Therefore, he was left with no other option but to go into business so that he could earn a living. \r\n\r\nIn 1994, Osman established a business selling shirts, shorts, T-shirts, sneakers and shoes for both men and women. He is assisted by his distant cousin. Competition is high but he buys quality goods. He usually goes to Conakry twice per month by public vehicle. He serves people around town and his business is popular as his goods are always available when his customers need them. Working 7 days a week and 10 hours a day, he earns about 2,742,000 leones (SLL) every month from this business. Rise in foreign exchange is one of his major problems. \r\n\r\nOsman would like a loan of 4,000,000 SLL. He requires a loan to buy jeans (50 pairs @ 47,000 SLL) and T-shirts (50 @ 24,000 SLL). The balance of 450,000 SLL is for transport. He hopes that this loan will enable him to increase his monthly profits by approximately 411,000 SLL.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Osman plans to build a house and send his elder daughter for studies abroad. It is good for him to take out this loan because he will make extra profit from it. Osman will save some of his profit and add the balance to his existing capital.

He is married to a businesswoman and has three children aged 7, 5 and 1 year old. One of his children is a school-going child. In 1999, Lamin established his jeans, polo, shirts, lacoste and trousers etc. business. He began his business because he did not go to school but rather joined his father in farming. After he fully matured, he left farming in the village for the city. In the city, he helped to sell for somebody on commission where he accumulated some funds, which he used to start his own business. Working 7 days a week and 10 hours a day, he earns about Le 1,437,100 every month from this business. \n\nHe would like a loan for Le 4,000,000.  Lamin has already received and successfully repaid three loans and now requires a new loan in order to purchase used clothing. He wants to purchase the following items:  T-shirts 2 bales @ Le 580,000, Lacoste 2 bales @ Le 650,000 and trousers 2 bales @ Le 700,000. He will use the balance of the loan to pay for transport. He hopes that this loan will enable him to increase his monthly profits by approximately Le 287,420.  \n\nIn the future, Lamin plans to provide a quality education for his children, build a house and have a shop.  He felt good about taking this loan and the loan will help him to improve his business and his family's standard of living.  His major challenge is that sometimes the bales he buys contain spoiled\/damaged clothing. He serves 15 customers each day. His business is popular because he sells quality used clothing. Lamin does not have any employees. His suppliers are located in Conakry and he transports his good by public transport. He buys three times in a month.  He plows back the profit into the business. He is planning to expand and this will accomplish by acquiring more loans.

She is widowed and has four children; two of them are still in college, and the others have graduated from college. Veronica finished sixth grade and did not continue with school because she could not afford it. She lives in her own house with her family and supports her mother-in-law by sending her some money to help with household expenses.\r\n\r\nShe has been a businesswoman for more than 20 years, and her favorite product to sell is meat. She buys it in the Kingdom of Swaziland and resells it in Boane, which gives her an income of around 4,000 to 5,000 meticais per month. She uses the money for household expenses and saves some in her bank account (at BIM).\r\n\r\nVeronica has never had loans from other banks. She learned about Hluvuku through a friend who is also a customer of this institution.

He is married to a businesswoman and has 4 children aged 18, 13, 11 and 3 years respectively. In 1996, Yusifu S established his jeans, polo shirts, Lacoste clothes, and bags business. He started business at the time his father died when he was in form two (education level) and there was no other financial support. He decided to leave school and went to a mining area. He engaged in mining and acquired some funds which he used to start his business.   Working 7 days a week and 12 hours a day, he earns about Le 1,510,800 every month from this business. He would like a loan in the amount of Le 4,000,000. Yusifu S has already received and successfully repaid 2 loans, and now requires a new loan in order to purchase jeans 70 pieces @ Le35,000, shirts 36 pieces @ Le25,000, lacoste - 24 pieces @ Le22,000. The balance of the loan will be used for transport. He hopes that this loan will enable him to increase his monthly profits by approximately Le 300,160. In the future, Yusifu S plans to complete his construction building, educate his children, and he also wants to open another shop. His major challenge is the fluctuation in foreign currency.  Competition is high but he is different from his competitors because he always has what the customers want.  He serves 10 customers each day.  His business is popular because he provides good customer care and he has quality items. Yusifu does not have any employees. His suppliers are located in Conakry, Guinea and he transports his goods by public transport. He buys three times in a month.  He ploughs the profit back into the business.  He plans to expand and this will be accomplished by acquiring more loans. He thanks you for your support."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":237.5,"image":{"id":955468,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to purchase jeans, shirts, and Lacoste clothes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Makeni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.883333 -12.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":148,"posted_date":"2011-12-22T05:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":950,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yusifu S","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":4000000,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.75},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.75},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.75},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.75},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.75},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.75},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.75},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":118.75,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:40:12Z","rounded_local_amount":510625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257124804,"comment":null},{"amount":118.75,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-16T07:49:06Z","rounded_local_amount":510625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263505710,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-23T03:53:02Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":373946,"name":"Tigran","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tigran lives in the Ddmashen village area of Sevan.

This will allow Tigran to develop his farm and thus to increase his family\u2019s income.     \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":129.78,"image":{"id":955475,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy some bee families, a cow and fodder for his farm animals","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AM","country":"Armenia","town":"Sevan","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"40 45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":146,"posted_date":"2011-12-22T05:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tigran","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"AMD","disbursal_amount":1000000,"loan_amount":2625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":23060},{"due_date":"2012-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":26380},{"due_date":"2012-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":28670},{"due_date":"2012-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":27710},{"due_date":"2012-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":27250},{"due_date":"2012-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":29830},{"due_date":"2012-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":29420},{"due_date":"2012-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":29050},{"due_date":"2012-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":30280},{"due_date":"2012-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":30730},{"due_date":"2012-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":30830},{"due_date":"2012-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":31640},{"due_date":"2013-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":30810},{"due_date":"2013-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":33180},{"due_date":"2013-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":33640},{"due_date":"2013-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":33280},{"due_date":"2013-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":33790},{"due_date":"2013-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":34540},{"due_date":"2013-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":35050},{"due_date":"2013-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":35370},{"due_date":"2013-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":35910},{"due_date":"2013-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":36280},{"due_date":"2013-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":37320},{"due_date":"2013-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":37720},{"due_date":"2014-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":38040},{"due_date":"2014-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":38840},{"due_date":"2014-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":39570},{"due_date":"2014-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":39820},{"due_date":"2014-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":40670},{"due_date":"2014-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":41320}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.53},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.25},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.26},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.74},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.53},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.3},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.23},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.26},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.48},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.93},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.05},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.88},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.1},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.3},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.36},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.7},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.85},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.26},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.24},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.96},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.02},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.85},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.96},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.87},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.53},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.76},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.46}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":61.06,"local_amount":23260,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:31:46Z","rounded_local_amount":23342.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257263736,"comment":null},{"amount":68.72,"local_amount":26180,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:44:04Z","rounded_local_amount":26273.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263404931,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-12-29T18:53:12Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":373948,"name":"Mamie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mamie lives in Buchanan.

She is married to a driver and has five children aged 17, 15, 10, 7 and 3 years. Four of the children are going to school. In 1993, Adamsay G. established her groundnut business. She began her business because her parents did not allow her to go to school and she had to take care of the younger ones and assist her mother in selling local foodstuffs.  After she was fully grown, her mother gave her some money to start her own business. Working 7 days a week and 11 hours a day, she earns about Le 1,349,000 every month from this business. \r\n\r\nShe would like a loan of Le 4,500,000. Adamsay G. has already received and successfully repaid two loans and now requires a new loan to purchase 10 bags of groundnuts @ Le 420,000. The remaining funds from the loan will be used for transport. She hopes that this loan will enable her to increase her monthly profits by approximately Le 269,920. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Adamsay G. plans to build a house, educate her children to tertiary level and to have a store. She felt happy about taking this loan because it will help her to improve her business and earn more income.  Her major challenge is the frequent changes in the price of the goods.  Competition is keen and she overcomes her competitors by selling at a reduced cost. Adamsay G. serves 10 customers each day. Her business is popular because she has good interpersonal relationships with her customers.  She is assisted by family members. Her suppliers are located at Bamoi Town Lumor (Market Days Centre) and she transports her goods by public transport.  She buys four times a month.

She runs a small shop selling groceries but is mostly in the business of raising sheep.  She buys purebred sheep that she raises and resells after 10 to 12 months.

She is married to a mechanic and has 2 children, aged 7 and 16 years. She has 1 additional dependent, who lives with her. She came to live with Hawa to attend school in the city and also help with domestic work.  \r\n\r\nIn 2001, Hawa established her secondhand electrical equipment\/appliances, carpet etc. business. She began her business because her parents could not afford to pay her school fees. Since she could not further her studies, she joined her mother in business, and when her mother died she had to partner with her elder brother in the business.  Working 7 days a week and 10 hours a day, she earns about Le 2,508,000 every month from this business. \r\n\r\nShe would like a loan in the amount of Le 5,000,000. Hawa has already received and successfully repaid 2 loans, and now requires a new loan in order to purchase 10 small pieces of secondhand carpet @ Le150,000 each, 10 DVD players @ Le125,000 each, 10 rolls of electrical cable @ Le100,000 each, 10 boxes of plugs @ Le80,000 each and 450 packets of light bulbs @ Le1,000 each. She hopes that this loan will enable her to increase her monthly profits by approximately Le 976,000. In the future, Hawa plans to build a house.  \r\n\r\nShe feels good that her business is growing.  She is planning to expand and give her children a better life.  She is excited about the future because in acquiring this loan she will be able to buy more stock to add to her existing business. Her major challenge is the high rate of taxation.  Competition is low as she is the only retailer in that area.  She serves people around the town and customers from interior villages.  She serves about 12 people per day as she offers quality products at affordable prices to suit her customers.  She buys her goods in Freetown three times a month through public transport.  She uses his profit to buy more stock for her business.  \r\n\r\nHawa is planning to expand by acquiring more loans and making better profits so that she will be able to achieve her plans.  She is hardworking and honest.

Halprat is 19 years old and lives in the town of Kyotera in the Masaka region of Uganda. For the past 3 years, she has been working hard to manage her small market, which sells firewood and milk. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, she has requested a loan of 500,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more firewood for her business, and will help her to generate greater profits and pay school fees for her young brothers and sisters. Halprat hopes that in the future she will be able to buy cattle. \r\n\r\nHalprat is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to micro-finance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills training. The ELA program has increased Halprat's future prospects by helping her to learn how to negotiate with her customers.

He is married to a trader, and has 1 child aged three years old. In 2006, Mohamed L established his fast food business. He began his business because the culture of Fullas prefers business to any other thing in life. He also maintains that culture, so that was why he joined his father in business. After spending several years with his dad, he then decided to stand on his own by setting up his own business centre. Working 7 days a week and 7 hours a day, he earns about Le1,888,000 every month from this business.\r\n\r\nMohamed L would like a loan in the amount of Le 3,000,000. He has already received and successfully repaid 1 loan, and now requires a new loan in order to purchase 4 cartons of mayonnaise @ Le240,000 each, 5 cartons of milk @ Le210,000 each, 7 cartons of ketchup @ Le60,000 each, 1 bag of beans @ Le520,000 and 1 dozen cocoa @ Le50,000 each.  He hopes that this loan will enable him to increase his monthly profits by approximately Le 583,000. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Mohamed L plans to expand into a restaurant.  His feeling in taking this loan is good as it has helped him a lot.  He hopes to form a classic restaurant with a variety of food in service.  He wants his child to have a better life.  The loan will create a source to generate more income for him.\r\n\r\nChanges in the prices of goods that the customers demand is his major problem in this business.  Competition is not too great, as his food service is different from others.  He serves about 50 people per night around the city.  His business is popular because he makes good and tasty food to meet the standard of living of his customers.  \r\n\r\nMohamed has two employees.  He normally goes to Freetown once per month to buy his goods and to Makeni three times per week.  He also goes by public transport.  He uses some of his profit for his business and saves the rest for his future plans.  He is planning to expand by making good use out of the profit he will realize from the business.

It has improved since she started with the help of a loan she got from Kiva partner, Al Majmoua.
