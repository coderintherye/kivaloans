Since her pigs now grow very fast and eat a lot, Mrs. Chum M. does not have enough money to buy pig food for them, so she decided to ask for a loan for this purpose.  Her husband, Mr. Nuon Kimkuon, is a construction worker who makes $2.50 to support his family, and it is not enough income to meet the needs of the family.  Mrs. Chum M. is 36 years old and the mother of four children, two of whom are attending school while the remaining two are too young to work or study because they are at the ages of one and three. \r\n\r\nTwo members in the village bank have end-of-term loans and the rest have monthly payment loans.  These two members are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term.  End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK's main product because they are the most beneficial to Cambodia's poor.  It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to.  Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term.  Almost all of AMK's clients make their payments on time.

During the rainy season, she cultivates rice while growing vegetables in the dry season.  Her husband, Mr. Kem Touch, is a cow middleman who buys cows and re-sells them later at a better price.  Since this business is going well, he wants to expand it, so his wife, Mrs. Duch C., decided to ask for a loan to buy more calves for breeding in order to re-sell.  Mrs. Duch C. has five children, three of whom are employed in a garment factory, while the remaining two are attending school. \r\n\r\nThis village bank loan is an end-of-term loan and all the members are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term.  End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK's main product because they are the most beneficial to Cambodia's poor.  It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to.  Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term.  Almost all of AMK's clients make their payments on time.

After taking her children to school and finishing house chores, she starts making traditional delicacies. This is an everyday activity from 9 AM until 12 PM. It is a long process before the delicacies can reach her customers. From mixing the ingredients and sun-drying them, it takes one whole day. The capital she needs to buy ingredients suh as sticky rice, sugar and others is USD 55. Her lack of capital, makes her in need for capital loan from Dinari that cooperates with her village organization. Ready for sell delicacies are directly taken to her customers in the market. The delicacies are easy to be sold, as it is always used as an offering for Hindu's rituals in Bali.

kesehariannya bekerja sebagai saudagar sapi yang mengangkut sapi ke pasar penjualan harus memperbaharui sarana pengangkutannya supaya bisa mengangkut lebih banyak dan lebih cepat. Usaha yang ditekuni sejak lama ini memang memberi penghasilan yang lumayan untuk keluarga kecilnya bersama istri dan kedua anaknya yang masih kecil. Istrinya juga turut membantu usaha Made ini disamping juga memelihara ternak babi sebagai sampingan. Made bermaksud mengembangkan usahanya dengan menjual alat angkut sapinya yang terdahulu yaitu sebuah truk yang kecil dan sudah tua lalu kemudian menggantinya dengan yang baru dan lebih besar. Karena kekurangan modal untuk membeli alat usahanya dan Made mendengar bahwa DINARI mempunyai program yang bisa meningkatkan modal usaha masyarakat maka Made memutuskan untuk meminjam modal ke DINARI lewat program KIVA dengan jangka waktu 12 bulan. Dimana pembayaran akan dilakukan setiap bulannya. Dengan meminjam sebesar Rp. 5000.000,- ke DINARI mampu menambah modalnya untuk bisa mendapatkan alat angkut berupa truk yang lebih besar dengan kondisi lebih baru. Dengan truk ini Made mampu memasarkan sapi sampai 3 kali seminggunya dengan menggunakan 2 orang tenaga kerja serta jangkauan pembelian sapinya sampai ke daerah yang lebih jauh. Penghasilan yang didapat pu makin meningkat setiap bulannya sehingga mampu memenuhi gaji tenaga kerja yang dipakai serta sekaligus bisa mencukupi kebutuhan keluarganya.","en":"Due to the development of cow raising\/farm in his neighborhood, Made Yudana needs to renew his transportation vessel that can transport cows more and faster.

and is a taxi driver with his own automobile.  He works the route between Dushanbe and Yavan.  This business brings in income, but to increase his earning and reduce the cost of each trip Saidbek wants to install equipment to reduce gasoline consumption. To do so, he must take out a 12-month loan.  This would attract clients whose ride in his taxi would be less expensive.  In addition, he would be able to make more runs, earn more, and better support his family.  He is married and has four children.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Joyce K., Kiva

Mrs. Deang S. is the village bank president.  She is farmer and poultry breeder who raises 40 chickens.  Her husband, Mr. Pho Phat, is a motorbike taxi driver who makes $4 per day.  Even though she and her husband have different businesses, they sill cannot support their family well, so Mrs. Deang S. decided to ask for a loan to buy piglets to start a new business.  Mrs. Deang S. is 32 years old and the mother of two children who are both enrolled in the local school. \r\n\r\nTwo members in this village bank have end-of-term loans and the rest have monthly payment loans.  These two members are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term.  End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK's main product because they are the most beneficial to Cambodia's poor.  It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to.  Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term.  Almost all of AMK's clients make their payments on time.  AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09% and AMK has a default rate of 0% on

Each will use the loan for a different purpose.  For instance, Mrs. En T. is a farmer who is requesting a loan to buy fertilizers in order to produce a better crop while she faces infertile soil on her field.  Her husband, Mr. Seng Vuth, is laborer who makes $3 per day.  Mrs. En T. is 44 years old and she does not have any children.  She hopes to make a better crop with this loan. \r\n\r\nThis is a group loan consisting of mainly end-of-term loans.  Three members have end-of-term loans and the rest have monthly payment loans.  These three members are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term.  End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK's main product because they are the most beneficial to Cambodia's poor.  It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to.  Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term.  Almost all of AMK's clients make their payments on time.  AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09% and AMK has a default rate of 0% on Kiva."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":204244,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy fertilizers in order to produce a better crop while she faces infertile soil on her field.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":109,"posted_date":"2008-09-18T20:20:22Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"En","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pak","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Suon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-02T22:53:30Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":1600000,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2008-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":37.52,"local_amount":150100,"processed_date":"2008-11-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-15T20:08:10Z","rounded_local_amount":155653.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5285939,"comment":null},{"amount":18.8,"local_amount":75200,"processed_date":"2008-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T12:10:40Z","rounded_local_amount":77982.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9899038,"comment":null},{"amount":68.78,"local_amount":275100,"processed_date":"2009-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T09:55:56Z","rounded_local_amount":285278.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14823190,"comment":null},{"amount":18.77,"local_amount":75100,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:53:09Z","rounded_local_amount":77878.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20359622,"comment":null},{"amount":18.78,"local_amount":75100,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:49:41Z","rounded_local_amount":77878.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27048673,"comment":null},{"amount":18.77,"local_amount":75100,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T10:58:49Z","rounded_local_amount":77878.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35940344,"comment":null},{"amount":60.38,"local_amount":241500,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T16:44:55Z","rounded_local_amount":250435.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44397929,"comment":null},{"amount":33.2,"local_amount":132800,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-22T07:39:02Z","rounded_local_amount":137713.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52905750,"comment":null},{"amount":125,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T11:57:43Z","rounded_local_amount":518500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86985184,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-09-18T22:53:30Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T11:57:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":65703,"name":"Mwanahamisi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mambo from Dar es Salaam, Tanzania!

She now focuses on selling maize because it is the most marketable, being used to make ugaali, a staple food in this country. She earns about 180 USD in profit monthly from this business. She is requesting a loan to purchase maize in bulk. In the future, she hopes to increase the scale of her business.\r\n<P>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of microcredit in Tanzania. The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

Prohok is made by using small fish as an ingredient for soup. Roast Beef with Prohok is an exceptionally delicious menu in Cambodia.

Seven members have end-of-term loans and the rest have monthly payment loans. These members are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK's main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia's poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to do so. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK's clients make their payments on time.

The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

Fourteen members have end-of-term loans and the rest have monthly payment loans. These members are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK's main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia's poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to do so. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK's clients make their payments on time.

The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

Zulfiya has a small trade outlet at the regional central market, where she deals in household cleaners.  Her neighbors do not need to go to town for laundry powder, soap, etc.  They know that they can buy all that not far from home.  As the sole source of support for her children, Zulfiya wants to increase the variety of goods she has to offer.  The higher the quality of the goods she has, the greater the income.

As time has passed, Nohemi has been selling brand-name beauty products and says she has already found a supplier who offers products of higher quality and more usefulness. <p>\r\nWe invite you to support Nohemi so her business keeps growing!<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":209604,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"Revamp supply of beauty products to sell via catalog","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Garc\u00eda, Nuevo Le\u00f3n","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":16,"posted_date":"2008-10-03T16:10:25Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nohemi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-17T18:37:12Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":5000,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2008-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":833.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2008-11-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-17T09:06:29Z","rounded_local_amount":848.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5279867,"comment":null},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2008-12-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-21T08:53:36Z","rounded_local_amount":848.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9891650,"comment":null},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2009-01-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-24T08:49:16Z","rounded_local_amount":848.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14814881,"comment":null},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2009-02-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T07:52:44Z","rounded_local_amount":848.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20349713,"comment":null},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2009-03-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:00:24Z","rounded_local_amount":848.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27037017,"comment":null},{"amount":79.15,"local_amount":833.35,"processed_date":"2009-04-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-02T07:51:10Z","rounded_local_amount":848.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35927452,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-10-03T18:37:12Z","paid_date":"2009-06-02T07:51:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":65796,"name":"Las Tres Estrellas Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The Las Tres Estrellas (\"The Three Stars\") group is maD. up of thirteen women who live in the Villa Ingenio neighborhood of El Alto, Bolivia.

He has been in business for over 13 years, making jackets, g\u00fcipiles (traditional Guatemalan dresses) and other traditional apparel in assorted styles and varieties. He sells his merchandise in Antigua Guatemala and Sol\u00f3la. A few years ago, he visited the Asdir office to request a loan in order to increase his capital and stock up on merchandise. With his previous loan, his business was able to grow financially and develop in a different way. Upon noticing that both his business and his family\u2019s standard of living have been improving on a daily basis, he once again feels the need to obtain another loan that will be invested in increasing his work capital and improving production. Because the town fair is approaching, he would like to be able to produce more and earn more profits for his own benefit. Furthermore, the end of the year is coming up, and with this loan he wants to display his work to the tourists who visit the country so that they can purchase our traditional clothing.<br

She buys and sells cows at the markets in Pilcuyo, Acora and Ilave for a living. <p>\r\nWith this loan of 2,000.00 PEN, which she will repay in 4 monthly installments, she will purchase 2 cows for 900.00 and 1,000.00 PEN each. Her vision is to have her own cow shed because it would bring her luck, and because selling cows is more lucrative for her than selling bulls. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Elizabeth Casian, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":204466,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase cattle (cows)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Pilcuyo - Collao, Puno","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2008-09-17T20:50:23Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alejandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-02T03:00:13Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":168.75},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":168.75},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":168.75},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":168.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":168.75,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2008-11-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T07:55:15Z","rounded_local_amount":503.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5330861,"comment":null},{"amount":168.75,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T00:39:27Z","rounded_local_amount":503.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9951231,"comment":null},{"amount":168.75,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T13:39:06Z","rounded_local_amount":503.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10224258,"comment":null},{"amount":168.75,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T19:42:59Z","rounded_local_amount":503.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20416991,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-09-18T03:00:13Z","paid_date":"2009-03-16T19:42:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":65803,"name":"Brigida","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Do\u00f1a Br\u00edgida cumpli\u00f3 37 a\u00f1os de edad.

Sometimes travelling T. these remote villages can be a tedious part of the job of a Fellow, but Santa Clara is one of my favourite villages that I have visited, and I don't hesitate T. agree T. go.\r\n<P>\r\nAfter the long but easy journey there, I meet with the Ca\u00f1averales group on the patio next T. the kitchen of a senior member just off  one of the main streets of Santa Clara.  The bright floral-patterned blouses and skirts of the women nearly blind one with their brilliance and the space is abuzz with their happy conversation and laughter.  Children of all ages dart back and forth between the women, being so affectionate with each that it's difficult T. tell which woman is a particular child's mother.  Despite the commotion, it takes only a few moments before I can quiet everyone so I can ask them a few questions.\r\n\r\n<P>Despite the fact that Santa Clara is most famous for basket-making (as proudly displayed on the sign that welcomed me inT. the town), the common thread of the group is that all 17 women tend small farms, raising either chickens or pigs or both.  Fourteen of them also supplement their income with embroidery while three others put their sewing skills T. work.  One of the women also buys and sells clothing.  The group's president, Carmen Rosa, who has a farm of 50 chickens and embroiders as well, tells me that none of the women has T. leave the town T. sell their products as Santa Clara is the commercial hub for the surrounding area.\r\n<P>\r\nThese women are no strangers T. micro-credit.  They already know the life-changing potential of this money; for some of them, this will be their eighth loan.  Friendship Bridge is implementing a new repayment scheme for experienced groups such as this one.  The Ca\u00f1averales will pay back this loan in 9 months instead of the normal 13, and they're quite confident of their ability T. meet this more demanding schedule.\r\n<P>\r\nT. my question about the benefits this loan may bring, one of the older women, Catalina, tells me that she just recently had all her chickens and her pig slaughtered.  With the credit that she's applying for now, she hopes T. replenish her stocks and this time she'll try T. raise two pigs.  Another younger woman, Florinda, stands up and says  that with the profit she makes with her embroidery design, her ever-growing young children will finally be able T. have clothes that fit them for school.\r\n<P>\r\nMy last question of the session: what are your dreams?  The answer is never very different from group T. group, or even person T. person, anywhere across the world.  All the women want their children T. have a better life with more opportunities than they have had.  Resoundingly and almost in one voice, they hope that their children can achieve a level of education that was unavailable T. them.  The extra money from micro-credit loans like the ones provided by Kiva and Friendship Bridge will help ensure that this will

There, life were going well, but when they returned home, they confronted some financial problems. Because they had to rebuild their destroyed home and buy some necessary equipment for their house with their own savings.<P>\r\n\r\nQudrat's father was an active man and immediately started farming on their own lands. He grew rice and able to get US$ 1000 net profit from that. After a few months he bought a small retail shop for his son, and their problems were solving themselves day by day.<P>\r\n\r\nIn the last 2 years, Qudrat's father has been faced with some serious illnesses and the doctors recommended him to rest.<P>\r\n\r\nBefore his wedding, Qudrat U. was working with his brother in his shop, but when he got married, he decided to start an independent business. Definitely he had 150,000 Afghanis (US$ 3000) of his own capital, and he opened a retail shop in Jalalabad city and purchased some goods. <P>\r\n\r\nAs Qudrat U. is as active as his father, he wants to expand his business more, and through it pave the way for his younger brothers to continue their studying, and have money to cure his sick father. For this purpose he doesn't have enough money, so he has requested from AFSG a 50,000 Afghani loan for 18 months. He wants to purchase rice, sugar, oil, and flour for his shop with this money, and increase his customer base.<P>\r\n\r\nQudrat hopes that if he is able to achieve his goals, then he will change this business and will make a poultry farm. Because he thinks that those farms are more profitable than other businesses in this area.

She buys the clothing in bags or bales from Kampala, which usually include children's and ladies' clothing. This is not an easy job and most, like Aisha, would like to be able to afford to rent a storefront. She says that if she opens a shop in the future, she would want to keep up her current trade and, due to old age, maybe hire someone to do the moving around for her since it is also a profitable business.<p>\r\n\r\nAisha has been in the business for a very long time.

He also sells baskets in the market to supplement his income. \r\n<p>\r\nThis will be Mohamed's sixth loan from Tujijenge Tanzania. He used the previous loans to buy a sofa set for his house and to purchase more utensils and pots to cook the soup. He paid back all the loans successfully. With the loan he hopes to receive now, he will increase his soup business.\r\n<p>\r\nMohamed is a member of Nguvu Moja group (meaning \"together we are one\" in Swahili). The members of the group hold each other accountable in paying back their loans. In the picture, Mohamed is with his subgroup and is standing in the back row on the right. To his left is Juma Z. (salon owner). In front from left to right is Shani A. (clothing sales), Nasra S. (general store owner) and Halima A. (food vendor)."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1225,"image":{"id":204685,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"To increase soup selling business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":87,"posted_date":"2008-10-01T07:01:21Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mohamed","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Shani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juma","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nasra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Halima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-15T21:43:49Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":1410000,"loan_amount":1225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":352500},{"due_date":"2008-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":352500},{"due_date":"2009-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":352500},{"due_date":"2009-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":352500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":306.25},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":306.25},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":306.25},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":306.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":306.25,"local_amount":352500,"processed_date":"2008-11-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T00:40:00Z","rounded_local_amount":355096.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5354307,"comment":null},{"amount":306.25,"local_amount":352500,"processed_date":"2008-12-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T04:09:24Z","rounded_local_amount":355096.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9977902,"comment":null},{"amount":306.25,"local_amount":352500,"processed_date":"2009-01-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:40:08Z","rounded_local_amount":355096.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14893979,"comment":null},{"amount":306.25,"local_amount":352500,"processed_date":"2009-02-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:27:06Z","rounded_local_amount":355096.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20445563,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-10-01T21:43:49Z","paid_date":"2009-03-16T21:27:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":65914,"name":"Pov","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is the second time Mrs. Pov S. has asked for a loan to improve her business activity.

A widow with four school-aged children, she and her domestic employee Suzanne work together selling fresh tomatoes and peppers.  Suzanne handles itinerant sales in nearby districts, while Therese has set up shop in the Degakon district market.  She procures her stock from Houegbo in Atlantique province, 70 kilometers from Cotonou, as tomatoes and peppers are less expensive at that market.

Baptist Primary School was founded by the Baptist Church in 1974. <P>\r\n\r\nSince its inception in 1974, this school lacked a formal building of its own. The school depended on renting one unfinished house after another. But thanks to the government, through a World Bank-sponsored programme they had their first building constructed in 1993 with only five classrooms. This was not enough, however, to host the growing number of pupils in the community; the school was, and still remains, the only primary school around the Back of Police Community. Thus in 2000, the United Nations Observers' Mission in Sierra Leone (UNOMSL) built them another five-classroom building. <P>\r\n\r\nToday, they are proud of two buildings with a well trained and qualified staff of eighteen. They have a very good record in terms of public examinations. They always achieve a record of 100% at the National Primary Schools Exams (NPSE).<P>\r\n\r\nThis is their second loan from Kiva through SMT (Kiva\u2019s Field Partner). The previous loan was a great success for these teachers. Some used their loans to attend to their children's schooling; others invested theirs in businesses or agriculture; and others used them for personal expenses, like purchasing furniture. Still others used their loans to start or finish the construction of a house.<P>\r\n\r\nTheir head teacher, Mr. Henry S. K. (at the back left, in green), was one among those who invested their loans in building a house. That loan (Le 1,000,000), though small he said, helped him to start the construction of a house. With this new loan (Le 1,500,000), he will now be able to push the building process to another level. This is a great help to them, said Mr. Henry, who has been a teacher for the past 35 years. With a loan, each of the teachers will be able to handle a large sum of money in bulk, invest it in something great, and then repay gradually out of their meager salaries. <P>\r\n\r\nMr. Henry is now 55 years of age. He was born in a village called Bumbuna, about 30 miles from Magburaka, the Tonkolili District head-quarter town, Northern Sierra Leone. He is married with three children, who are all still in school."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4450,"image":{"id":204766,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction","sector":"Construction","use":"To

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":205020,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"To buy more grocery inventory","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-09-21T16:40:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-05T16:46:15Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2008-11-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:19:26Z","rounded_local_amount":52177.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347996,"comment":null},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2008-12-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:07:15Z","rounded_local_amount":52177.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970574,"comment":null},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-01-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:12:15Z","rounded_local_amount":52177.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886791,"comment":null},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-02-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:01:39Z","rounded_local_amount":52177.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436051,"comment":null},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:54:01Z","rounded_local_amount":52177.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130324,"comment":null},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:22:41Z","rounded_local_amount":52177.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027153,"comment":null},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:12:21Z","rounded_local_amount":52177.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613193,"comment":null},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:00:37Z","rounded_local_amount":52177.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010276,"comment":null},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:36Z","rounded_local_amount":52177.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232587,"comment":null},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:51:41Z","rounded_local_amount":52177.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664403,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-09-21T16:46:15Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T21:51:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":66054,"name":"Gulom","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gulom M. is 45 years old.

This is 32 year-old Joyce M..  She is not married and has one child, aged 1. In 2003, Joyce established her crops business. Joyce has already received and successfully repaid three loans from SELFINA, and now requires a new loan in order to buy more crops in bulk. She thanks you for your support.  \r\n\r\nSELFINA is engaged in economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through leasing and leaseback facility as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women.\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing.

from Tanzania! This is 43-year-old Mary M. from Mwanza.  Married with four children between the ages of seven and twenty, Mary has been running a grocery business selling water, soda, biscuits, flours, and sugar since 2005. Working at the business 16 hours a day, seven days per week and assisted by husband, she currently earns about $400 each month. She is requesting a loan of $950 in order to buy more soda, flours, sugar, and water, and in the future plans to increase the quantity and range of her stock. Mary thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.

This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. <P>\r\n\r\nOne of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":205069,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Phone Accessories","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy more vouchers and phone accessories","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-09-19T16:20:27Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Esther","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-03T18:53:28Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2008-11-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:19:47Z","rounded_local_amount":52002,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5348013,"comment":null},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2008-12-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:05:56Z","rounded_local_amount":52002,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970596,"comment":null},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-01-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:11:47Z","rounded_local_amount":52002,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886813,"comment":null},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-02-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:00:42Z","rounded_local_amount":52002,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436073,"comment":null},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:53:33Z","rounded_local_amount":52002,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130346,"comment":null},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:22:12Z","rounded_local_amount":52002,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027171,"comment":null},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:11:54Z","rounded_local_amount":52002,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613211,"comment":null},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:00:06Z","rounded_local_amount":52002,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010294,"comment":null},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:36:59Z","rounded_local_amount":52002,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232605,"comment":null},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:50:50Z","rounded_local_amount":52002,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664421,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-09-19T18:53:28Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T21:50:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":66096,"name":"Prak","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Prak N. owns a small grocery store in the local market which is located in Kampong Chrey Village in Takeo Province.

(He is on the left in the photo.)<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is the rainy season now and Mrs. S. wants to cultivate rice on the plantation. Unfortunately, she cannot do this because she does not have enough animals to plow the field. Thus, she decided to ask for a loan to buy another cow to add to the old one and use them as draft animals. She would use the rest of the money to buy fertilizers to support her rice field later.<\/p>\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":205075,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":205079,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"To buy maize flour, soda, rice, and wheat flour","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-09-19T13:20:23Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Debora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-03T15:43:31Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2008-11-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:19:48Z","rounded_local_amount":52002,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5348014,"comment":null},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2008-12-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:06:03Z","rounded_local_amount":52002,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970597,"comment":null},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-01-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:10:04Z","rounded_local_amount":52002,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886814,"comment":null},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-02-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:00:51Z","rounded_local_amount":52002,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436074,"comment":null},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:53:18Z","rounded_local_amount":52002,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130347,"comment":null},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:22:14Z","rounded_local_amount":52002,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027172,"comment":null},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:11:57Z","rounded_local_amount":52002,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613212,"comment":null},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T23:59:54Z","rounded_local_amount":52002,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010295,"comment":null},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:02Z","rounded_local_amount":52002,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232606,"comment":null},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:50:52Z","rounded_local_amount":52002,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664422,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-09-19T15:43:31Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T21:50:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":66105,"name":"Hoang Thi","description":{"languages":["vi","en"],"texts":{"vi":"Mrs. Hoang Thi T. is 39 years old.

Elizabeth thanks you for her support!\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":205091,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pharmacy","sector":"Health","use":"To purchase more medicines.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-09-19T15:50:22Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-03T17:07:03Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2008-11-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:19:49Z","rounded_local_amount":52002,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5348015,"comment":null},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2008-12-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:06:09Z","rounded_local_amount":52002,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970598,"comment":null},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-01-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:10:09Z","rounded_local_amount":52002,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886815,"comment":null},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-02-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:00:54Z","rounded_local_amount":52002,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436075,"comment":null},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:53:22Z","rounded_local_amount":52002,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130348,"comment":null},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:22:17Z","rounded_local_amount":52002,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027173,"comment":null},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:11:58Z","rounded_local_amount":52002,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613213,"comment":null},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T23:59:55Z","rounded_local_amount":52002,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010296,"comment":null},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:03Z","rounded_local_amount":52002,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232607,"comment":null},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:50:54Z","rounded_local_amount":52002,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664423,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-09-19T17:07:03Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T21:50:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":66115,"name":"Hoang Thi","description":{"languages":["vi","en"],"texts":{"vi":"Mrs. Hoang Thi H. is 33 years old.
