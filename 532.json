She lives in the San Antonio neighborhood of the municipality of La Paz. She started her business because her husband abandoned her, and she needed a source of income to raise her children. Since there are no companies in her village where she could look for a job, it occurred to her that she could buy secondhand clothing and set up a small shop in her home. In addition to this, for the past two years, Elsa has operated a food stand in the local school. Her children are longer an economic burden for her, since they are now working, but she helps them with her grandchildren because she loves them very much. Elsa is requesting the loan to buy two bales of secondhand clothing to resell, as well as some mannequins to display the clothing. With the help of the loan, her life will change in a positive way, because she will maintain her source of income and continue to support her household. Her goals are to expand her business to other nearby communities, and also to see her family more united.

Rhodora lives in Baseco Port Area, Manila with her husband, Antonio A., who is a photographer. They have six children, three of whom are already working, two are in elementary and one is still toddling at home.\r\n\r\nRhodora presently owns and manages a food stall while overseeing their tricycle operation. Rhodora caters mainly to people near their residence in Baseco. Most of her customers are people who used to wake up early in the morning for work or studies who do not have enough time to cook for themselves and still others are tricycle operators and drivers who just parked their units in front of her store while waiting for passengers. Rhodora and Antonio gather a net income of PHP 10,000 monthly, which they use to meet the needs of the entire family.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she would like to apply for a PHP 22,000 loan. Rhodora plans to use this loan to further her food vending business and to finally install their own electrical power supply.  Basically, the loan will serve as additional capital that will enable Rhodora to make her business more profitable and lead to more savings.\r\n\r\nAt present, Rhodora experiences complaints from her customers about the quantity of her food serving because she just adjusted it due to increasing prices of the raw ingredients she uses at present.  She is determined not to be swayed by these struggles, explains to them these adjustments and aims to make her business grow.  Rhodora dreams of seeing her children finish their studies and be used as one family for the glory of the Lord whom they serve.

attained an elementary education, Beverly S., 37, wants to achieve more in life- not just for herself but for her family as well. Beverly lives in the Baseco Port Area, Manila, with her husband Reynaldo S., who is a warehouseman. They have three children, who are all in elementary grades at this time.\r\n\r\nBeverly presently owns a sari-sari (variety) store and a direct-selling business which caters mainly to people near their residence in the Baseco Port Area, Manila. Her variety store and direct sale of beauty products and other items depends largely on Beverly's perseverance and social connections. She basically offers customers of her store groceries, eggs, condiments, rice, and household detergents, among other items. She offers branded apparel, cosmetics, footwear, and accessories for her direct selling business.  Beverly buys these items in bulk quantities and sells them piecemeal with minimum mark up. Beverly and Reynaldo gather a net income of PHP 10,000 monthly, which they use to meet the daily needs of the entire family including the studies of their children.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she would like to apply for a PHP 20,000 loan. She plans to use this loan to purchase additional stock for her variety store, and to purchase those items ordered in advance by her customers from her direct selling business. Basically, the loan will serve as additional capital that will enable Beverly to make her business more profitable and lead to more savings.\r\n\r\nBeverly dreams of having her own house and lot for her family and sending all her children to school until college.  She looks forward to the growth of her business to sustain their living.  As a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends to their weekly fellowship* meeting, from which she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and pay microfinance loans.

is a married woman who lives in Kabankalan City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures: a pig fattening and a food vending business. Her husband Saol H., who is 56 years old, works as a laborer to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have 5 children who are between 15 and 32 years old. Melly joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 6 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Melly has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 9,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 7,800, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 7th loan, she is borrowing PHP 12,000, which she intends to use to pay for more funds in business operations so that she can continue to save up for family needs and her children\u2019s education. Melly is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon- a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Leticia F. is from the village of Marcos, Roxas, Isabela. She is 57 years old. Leticia is the group leader of a 7-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Leticia F.'s Group.\r\n\r\nLeticia is married and has 7 adult-aged children. To make a living, Leticia owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for fattening and sale. Leticia has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 2,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Leticia joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Leticia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future. Leticia is requesting a new loan of 3,000 PHP which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This loan will be the 10th loan taken out by Leticia from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the loan to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva

is 30 years old and supports her family by operating a business venture buying and selling eggs. She lives in Lapu-Lapu City, Cebu City. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2008 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard buying and selling eggs, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 31,800. Charie is borrowing PHP 9,000 so that she can purchase more stock to sell. This will be her 6th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 7,500, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Charie aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \n\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon- a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She lives in Bayawan City, Negros Oriental. Josephine joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 5 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Josephine has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 6th loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000, which she intends to use to purchase more stock to sell so that she can continue to save up for future business expansion. Josephine is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon- a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

In Multan, this is a very common and demanding business because people from other cities come to buy embroidered dresses and other clothes from here due to their cheap rates and good quality. She collects orders from her neighborhood clients and finishes the orders on time to earn an income. She is very good at it and wants to expand her business on larger scale.  \r\n\r\nThat\u2019s why she has applied for a loan from Kiva's partner Asasah.

Together they live in Baseco, Manila.\r\n\r\nImelda owns a sari-sari (variety) store, where she sells merchandise essential to busy people in her community. There are times when her neighbors are too busy to go to the market or grocery store to purchase their needs. Coming to the rescue, Imelda provides them with what they immediately need such as a bottle of vinegar for cooking, a sachet of shampoo, or a bottle of cold soft drink to quench their thirst. Other than the sari-sari store, Imelda also buys and sells bananas, a favorite fruit of Filipinos, and operates a water refilling station. Being twenty years in business, she earns around Php 750\/day.\r\n \r\nTo help her continue the operation of her growing business, she would like to apply for a Php 29,000 loan. She plans to use this money to boost her banana buying and selling business. She will also invest the money in her sari-sari store to further meet the varying needs of her community. She believes that her entrepreneurial skills are being honed and her businesses are becoming more profitable.\r\n\r\nThere are problems Imelda faces at present, but she considers none of them worth emphasizing. She believes that these are twists and turns in her life that make it more interesting. She is praying for an increased capacity to earn in order to be able to make her business flourish.\r\n\t\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

It is a residential business which has been in operation for fifteen years now. Their family mainly runs the store, catering to the immediate needs of their community, such as rice, milk in sachets, and instant food sold in pouches. Monthly they earn an average income of Php 10,500.\r\n\r\nTo further help her grow her business, Lolita decided to borrow Php 24,000. She wants to add more groceries to her store and also start selling beverages amd retailing charcoal which is widely used as household fuel in her community. A big part of the loan will go to these purchases, while Lolita intends to use part of the money for the improvement of their house. \r\n\r\nLife is as hard as a rock, but with the wisdom Lolita has gained through her experience, she claims that life can be smooth sailing for her. She hopes to maintain a savings account and dreams of a flourishing grocery business.\r\n\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

is a widow who lives in Siaton, Negros Oriental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures: a variety store and a carenderia (mini-restaurant). She has two children who are 26 and 20 years old. Gaudencia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1991 because she wanted something better for her family. \r\n\r\nWith the help of her past 16 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Gaudencia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 25,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of about $207, raising the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 17th loan, she is borrowing 25,000 PHP, which she intends to use as additional working capital so that she can continue to save up for future household expenses and for her family\u2019s future. Gaudencia is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

To make a living, she owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising pigs for fattening and sale. She is just starting this business.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Cecelia joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies.\r\n\r\nCecelia is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which again will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This will be her 7th loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful micro-finance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

S. is from the village of Kapatagan, Lanao Del Norte. She is 34 years old.

Rosalie has been engaged in her business for more than six years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Rosalie joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her business and living situation. Rosalie has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Rosalie is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be the second loan taken out by Rosalie from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

She also hopes that her business will continue to grow and that she will be able to send all her children all the way through college. To help her continue to operate her business, she is requesting a loan of 14,000 PHP. She plans to use this loan to purchase additional items for her store. Emma believes that through this loan, she will be able to expand her inventory and increase her earning capacity.\r\n<br>As a CCT community partner*, Emma faithfully attends her weekly fellowship meetings where she can draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God as a mother and as a micro-entrepreneur.\r\n<p>\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and pay microfinance loans.

All three are profitable and altogether yield earnings of about PHP 11,000 per month. Letecia focuses her attention on her variety store, which is situated at their home. Having been in business for around five years now, Letecia already knows the needs of her community and responds to them by filling her store with essential food items and other products. \r\n\r\nTo further help her grow her business, Letecia has applied for a PHP 12,000 loan. She intends to use this loan to add more products to the array of items in her store to cater to the changing needs of her customers. Also, part of the money will be invested in her water refilling station. \r\n\r\nLetecia admits that competition in the area gives her a headache, but she is determined not to lose hope but to remain strong and overcome the challenge. She looks forward to earning more than enough in order to be able to have her own commercial space. She dreams of having her own house and lot,  where she can enjoy the evening rest with her family.

But it can be a big responsibility, too, especially if you are going to run that big family alone. This is the experience of Aleja F., 46, one of CCT*'s Community Partners in Manila. She is a widow with seven dependents. They used to live in Samar, Visayas few years back, but at present she and her family reside in Tondo, Manila.\r\n\r\nAleja's business is the buying and selling of plastic wares, through which she earns an average earning of Php11, 000 a month. She has done this kind of business for around two years by now. She conducts her daily business at home, with the help of a hired vendor.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting for a Php12,000 loan. She will use this fund to level up her plastic ware business, purchasing more products as she looks for more regular customers. With this, she will also have enough to pay the vendor she hires to sell her products. Indeed, this loan is one big step to help Aleja augment her family's daily needs, as it sustains her business.\r\n\r\nAleja says that the availability of a sales assistant is one major problem in her business. Sometimes, she finds no one available to work for her, which should not happen in any case. Nevertheless, she has big hopes that this problem will be met with a solution. Aleja hopes to save up and own a commercial space for her business. And the biggest dream of all, to see all of her children finish their schooling, because her family, big as it is, is all her heart could contain.\r\n\t\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance

M. is 47 years old and lives in Parola, Binondo, Manila with her husband, Eduard Merced, who is also her business partner. They have four children who help them to run their restaurant business. Yolanda has a high school education and wants to achieve more in life, not just for herself but for her family as well. \r\n\r\nFor the past 20 years, Yolanda has been operating the family restaurant business. Family members make up the restaurant staff. The restaurant is strategically located at the populated area of Gate 54 Area C, Parola, Binondo, Manila. They have a large menu and serve all types of meals and snacks, including barbecue, smoked fish, and grilled meat and fish. At the end of the day, the family earns at least 1,000 PHP income.\r\n\r\nYolanda is requesting a loan of 31,000 PHP to help to continue her business. She will use the loan to purchase needed items to improve the restaurant and to provide working capital to increase profit and savings. Yolanda admits that cost increases to purchase raw ingredients have affected her business as well as difficulties providing good service to avoid complaints from her customers and patrons. Still, Yolanda is determined not to be swayed by these struggles and aims to make her business grow.  She prays that she will be able to sustain her business and make it flourish so she can leave it as a legacy to her children.\r\n\r\nYolanda wishes a good, healthy and peaceful life for her family and prays that their house will be renovated before the end of this first quarter.  As a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends weekly fellowship* meetings where she draws strength and inspiration from the Word of God and her life as a mother, a wife, and as a community partner.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and pay microfinance loans.

Lorna is married to Ibarra, a store owner. They live in Tondo, Manila, where they are raising their only child, who is now in elementary school.\r\n\r\nLorna co-runs a residential sari-sari (variety) store with Ibarra. Here, they buy sacks of rice and sugar and sell it retail. The rice is sold per kilo, while the sugar is repacked into pouches of usually a half kilo each. Lorna has been in business for twenty years, and they run their present sari-sari store without hiring any employees. Monthly they earn around Php 9,000.\r\n\r\nBecause she believes that her business has a future, she decided to borrow Php 14,000 to help her grow her business. She will use this loan money to purchase more sacks of rice and sugar. Lorna will make sure that her products are always available for her customers. Also, part of the loan money will go for the schooling of her child.\r\n\r\nLorna mentions having difficulties with customers who incur debts and with competitors in the area. However, she sees the future positively, when these difficulties are met with corresponding solutions. She dreams of a flourishing business, and a child of her own who will be finishing college with flying colors.\r\n\r\n\t\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

With the loan, she will buy a new sewing machine which will help her complete orders in a shorter period of time and make more income every month. \r\n \r\nNasira is hopeful that an investment will bring more profit for her and she will be able to marry off her elder son in the near future by saving money from her profit. \r\n\r\nShe is a regular loan user of Asasah and this is her 5th loan application. In previous loan years, she has always paid her installments on time and never missed a single meeting.

God is a God of chances, we ought to give other people chances to make right the mistakes they have done. Estella R., 33, lives to prove that, indeed, people deserve second chances. Estella is married to Jaime and together they raise a relatively young, big family of five children, of which one is adopted. One child is not yet of school age; two are enrolled in day care; and the other two are in elementary school.\r\n\r\nEstella's involvement in CCT* as a Community Partner enables her to run a two-year business in direct-selling. She sells products from the clothing brand MSE Apparel to friends, neighbors, and business connections. She has no commercial space yet, and thus works at home. Estella has also begun a food stall at home, where she prepares breakfast for neighbors who are in too much of a hurry to prepare one. With these businesses, she earns around 18,000 PHP monthly.\r\n\r\nMaking room for failures while achieving the best that she can, Estella is determined to make this food stall work. To help her grow her business, she applied for a 10,000 PHP loan. She will use these funds to buy can't-do-without items like plates, spoons and forks, a kettle, and most importantly, a gas stove. While preparing for this, she also plans to boost her direct selling business by purchasing more MSE products like shirts, shoes, and pants to sell.\r\n\r\nEstella admits struggling with the collection of payments from her customers. She mentions some have escaped the collection of payments. Also, she sees that there are times when her products would not sell. Nevertheless, Estella chooses to perceive these as second chances for her and for her customers to do better the next time. She aims to maintain a good savings account in CCT and grow her businesses so she will be able to make improvements on their house. Above all, she hopes that her children, young as they are, will not take chances, but will give it their best shot when it comes to their studies.\r\n\r\n\t\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":696948,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase utensils and facilities for cooking","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Manila City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-01-20T17:20:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Estella","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":3333.35,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:28:51Z","rounded_local_amount":3336.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191396079,"comment":null},{"amount":60,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:29:13Z","rounded_local_amount":2669.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195814188,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":3333.35,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:37:52Z","rounded_local_amount":3336.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201256753,"comment":null},{"amount":15,"local_amount":666.62,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:33:55Z","rounded_local_amount":667.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206123446,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-01-20T18:50:53Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T10:33:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":266817,"name":"Buchaguzi","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Buchaguzi N.  est entrepreneur, membre de groupe d\u2019affaire Tenez-bon, \u00e2g\u00e9e de 37 ans, veuve, m\u00e8re de 4 enfants.

She is 37, a widow, and a mother of 4. Her husband died from a sudden illness. She sells pork at the Kibabi communal market. She started her business with her own funds, which she received from her late husband. Around 2004, she was granted a $50 credit from Hekima, an MFI, in a \"Community Bank\" (a group of 30 to 45 women who can borrow up to $1000).

Having finished only high school, Ann knows that being a successful entrepreneur is a challenge she also has to take, and overcome. It is good that being a Community Partner in CCT* will help her do so. Ann is married to Raul, a maintenance worker in Honda Cars Makati. They currently live in Binondo with their three children, 2 of whom are still in elementary school.\r\n\r\nAnn is a rice retailer. Aside from that, she also sells eggs and charcoal. She would buy these items and sell them at a price her neighbors can afford. For two years, she has operated from home with the help of hired vendors. She earns around 10,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nTo further help her grow her business, Ann decided to apply for a 12,000 PHP loan. She intends to use this money to buy sacks of rice, as well as to replenish her charcoal supply in order to level up her business. She believes that a well-supplied store is a way towards profitability.\r\n\r\nOne specific business challenge Ann faces is the number of customers who take a long time to pay their debts, making it hard for her to replenish store supplies and buy other needed store materials. Aside from hoping to overcome this challenge, Ann also looks forward to a growing business in the next months. With full excitement, she dreams of seeing her children graduate from college.\r\n\r\n\t\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":696952,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase rice and charcoal to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Manila City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-01-20T17:50:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ann Marie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":12000,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.45},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.45},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.45},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.45},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":57.29,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:28:55Z","rounded_local_amount":2548.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191396080,"comment":null},{"amount":45.84,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:29:18Z","rounded_local_amount":2038.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195814189,"comment":null},{"amount":57.29,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:37:57Z","rounded_local_amount":2548.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201256754,"comment":null},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:34:00Z","rounded_local_amount":2038.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206123447,"comment":null},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:49:36Z","rounded_local_amount":2038.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211194695,"comment":null},{"amount":22.92,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:43:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1019.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216473942,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-01-20T19:34:17Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T10:43:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":266823,"name":"Kashenyi Twetungure Group B-Kihihi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"42-year-old N.

parenting is hard, all the more when you match it with being a hardworking entrepreneur. Jenneth V., 43, juggles both of these, but is not on the giving up side of the stick. Jenneth finished only high school, but she knows that her entrepreneurial training from CCT* will enable her to succeed. Jenneth is a widow raising three children. They used to live in Sultan Kudarat a few years ago, but now they reside in Tondo, Manila.\r\n\r\nJenneth owns a sari-sari (variety) store which she operates from her house. She has been in this business for two years now, and has managed to gain regular customers from her neighbors and friends. She earns around 9,000 Philippine Pesos (PHP) a month.\r\n\r\nTo help her grow her business, she has applied for a 13,000 PHP loan. She will use this money to buy more rice for retailing and soft drinks, which are often sought after by people who stay long under the sun. With this, she hopes to increase both her profits and her savings. \r\n\r\nJust like any ordinary sari-sari store owner in the Philippines, Jenneth finds it hard to deal with customers who manage to keep long lists of debts. Nevertheless, she stands firm on her hope that soon she will break through and succeed as an entrepreneur. She dreams of transforming her small store into a mini grocery. Also, just like any loving parent, she desires to see her children graduate from college and have a good future. \r\n\r\n\t\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance

Over the years, Guadalupeh Primary School, which is the only girls primary school in Lunsar town, has scored a lot of successes. Last academic year, for example, the school came in first in the National Primary Schools Examination (NPSE) for the whole Northern Province, and third for the entire country.\r\n \r\nThis is the first loan this school is accessing from Kiva through SMT. School staff from this institution, like many other schools' staff within SMT\u2019s operational areas, come to SMT to apply for loans. With the help of these loans, they can accomplish certain tasks that they would otherwise not be able to accomplish with their mere salaries alone. But with the help of this loan, some can pay school fees for their children; others can use the loan to buy pieces of furniture, a plot of land, house-building materials, or they can invest in business. At the end of each month, these teachers can repay the loan out of their monthly salaries.

teachers of the SLMB Primary School Junior, Lunsar town. This school was founded in 1964 by the Sierra Leone Muslim Brotherhood Mission to give education to the children of the community. The SLMB Primary school is staffed with 24 teachers and has an enrollment of 720 pupils. This is the first loan that teachers of this institution have benefited from Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\nMohamed Iyen K. is the leader of this group of teachers. The 40-year-old Mohamed was born in Lunsar town, in northern Sierra Leone. He has been in the teaching profession for eight years now. Mohamed is married to a businesswoman and they have four children. Mohamed is requesting a loan of SLL 1,050,000 to invest in his business. Mohamed used the first loan he received from SMT to start a small business in order to compliment his monthly salary. Having paid SMT successfully, he is now requesting a new loan from Kiva lenders in order to further expand his business. He will buy items like cigarettes, milk, soap, etc. to add to his business.   \r\n\r\nSchool staff from this institution, like many other schools staff within SMT\u2019s operational areas, come to SMT to apply for loans. With the help of these loans, they can accomplish certain tasks that they would otherwise have not been able to accomplish with their mere salaries alone. But with the help of this loan, some can pay school fees for their children; others can use the loan to buy pieces of furniture, a plot of land, house-building materials, or invest in business. At the end of each month, these teachers can repay the loan out of their monthly salaries. The institution\u2019s bursar is directly responsible for deducting the repayment and pays SMT on their behalf.\r\n\r\n(In the right of the photo is the head teacher at the school who did not collect the loan but serves as their guarantor. And attached on the left of the photo is a snap shot of a borrower who was not able to be present for a group photo)\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":3500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":697018,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy items like cigarettes, milk, soap, etc. to add to his business.

This school was opened in 1935 by the Roman Catholic church to educate the children of Lunsar and it environs. Presently, the school has 18 teachers and about 800 pupils. Over the years, the school has produced a great number of lecturers, teachers, and other professionals in different walks of life. \r\n\r\nThis is the first loan this school is accessing from Kiva through SMT. School staff from this institution, like many other schools' staff within SMT\u2019s operational areas, come to SMT to apply for loans. With the help of these loans, they can accomplish certain tasks that they would otherwise not be able to accomplish with their mere salaries alone. But with the help of this loan, some can pay school fees for their children; others can use the loan to buy pieces of furniture, a plot of land, house-building materials, or invest in business. At the end of each month, these teachers can repay the loan out of their monthly salaries. The institution\u2019s bursar is directly responsible for deducting the repayment and pays SMT on their behalf.\r\n\r\nForty-two year old Abdul H. T. (pictured back row, second from right) is a teacher at the school, and leader of this group. Born in Freetown, Abdul now lives and works in his mother\u2019s hometown of Lunsar. He is a class VI primary school teacher and has been in the teaching profession for seven years now. His wife too is a teacher. Mr. T. has requested this loan from Kiva lenders in order to buy pieces of furniture (such as chairs, tables, etc.) for his parlor. This will help him a lot and will make his life comfortable, Mr. T. said. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3000,"image":{"id":697039,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"To buy pieces of furniture (such as chairs, tables, etc.) for parlor.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Lunsar","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"8.5 -11.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2011-01-20T20:40:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abdul Hamid\t","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alex Sheku\t","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alhaji U.\t","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatmata \t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariatu \t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adama Antonette\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alfred D.\t","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Issa \t","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Safiatu E.\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"John Aruna\t","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Salamatu \t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joseph \t","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-01-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":12500000,"loan_amount":3000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1250000},{"due_date":"2011-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1250000},{"due_date":"2011-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1250000},{"due_date":"2011-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1250000},{"due_date":"2011-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1250000},{"due_date":"2011-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1250000},{"due_date":"2011-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1250000},{"due_date":"2011-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1250000},{"due_date":"2011-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1250000},{"due_date":"2011-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1250000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":300,"local_amount":1250000,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T05:32:45Z","rounded_local_amount":1258500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191486182,"comment":null},{"amount":300,"local_amount":1250000,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-20T08:13:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1258500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201953104,"comment":null},{"amount":300,"local_amount":1250000,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-18T07:58:45Z","rounded_local_amount":1258500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206572492,"comment":null},{"amount":600,"local_amount":2500000,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:57:58Z","rounded_local_amount":2517000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211297214,"comment":null},{"amount":300,"local_amount":1250000,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-20T08:01:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1258500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":217134545,"comment":null},{"amount":600,"local_amount":2500000,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-20T08:11:39Z","rounded_local_amount":2517000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227719547,"comment":null},{"amount":300,"local_amount":1250000,"processed_date":"2011-10-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-19T09:16:38Z","rounded_local_amount":1258500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":239285641,"comment":null},{"amount":300,"local_amount":1250000,"processed_date":"2011-11-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-20T09:09:07Z","rounded_local_amount":1258500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":245311228,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-01-21T03:17:10Z","paid_date":"2011-12-20T09:09:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":266846,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This Kiva borrower is a 52-year-old married man living with his wife and three young children.

She receives orders from her neighboring customers and earns well by completing the orders on time. Her income allows her to pay off the utility bills of her house.  \r\n\r\nZubaida is married to G. A. who is a tailor by profession. He specifically sews men\u2019s clothes and runs a shop in the market. Zubaida has given birth to 4 sons and 2 daughters. Her three elder sons are involved in different works. They couldn\u2019t complete their education and had to start work at a young age to financially support the family. Two of her 3 younger children are enrolled in school and are getting their education. \r\n\r\nZubaida has applied for a loan from Kiva partner Asasah for the improvement of her husband\u2019s tailoring business. He will invest the loan in purchasing a sewing machine and he will hire a worker who will help him complete the orders on time to make extra income. Zubaida is hopeful that the investment will take her husband\u2019s business to a more profitable position. \r\n\r\nNote: \u201cIn the photo, the lady with a raised hand is Zubaida\u201d.

Along with her husband, Miguel, she takes care of her adorable son, Swin, who is two years old. They live in harmony in their own house, located in the farm of Yanama Alto. Three years ago, she began to venture into agriculture, where she plants peas, potatoes, and olluco [a root plant]. After harvesting them, she sells them in a large market in the city of Tarma. At the same time as she runs her business, she ranches. She has animals including rams, cows, and bulls. Because of her young age and for the future of her family, she wants to venture into the business of buying and selling fresh grains. This is because it is a profitable business that has very few workers. She belongs to the communal bank \"Manatiales de Yanama\", and this is the sixth loan with MFP, where she works with strength and dedication. After harvesting the peas, Maximiliana will need money to plant her three hectares of agricultural land.

She is a single mother. She is dedicated to her work because it enables her to support her family.\r\n\r\nShe has a small nail salon where she does artificial nails, manicures, and pedicures. Sonia is requesting her third loan, which she believes will really increase her income.

She dreams of having her own house and sending her children to college.\r\n\r\nThis Esperanza associate began with Esperanza as she was learning how to work with artificial nails and how to paint artistic designs on them. She needed capital to start her business. Her story is representative of her group and, generally, of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican clients (many of whom recently emigrated to the Dominican Republic from Haiti).

D. C. is 37 years old and married with two school-aged children. She is from the village of Malipayon, Pangantucan, Bukidnon. To make a living, Marilyn owns and operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. Her main source of income comes from buying and selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap, canned goods, junk foods and toothpaste in the local community. She also buys and sells rice by the kilogram. Marilyn has been engaged in her business for over 4 years and earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nMarilyn joined HSPFI in 2009 to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Marilyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 17,000 PHP from HSPFI that was used to purchase additional inventory and provide working capital. Marilyn is requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP to purchase additional products to sell like canned goods, junk foods and rice. This loan will be the 5th loan taken out by Marilyn from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from her loan to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

Evelyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 11,000 PHP from HSPFI which she used to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. Evelyn is requesting a new loan of 14,000 PHP to purchase additional products to sell, such as deodorants and lotions. This will be her fourth loan from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI: HSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

This time, for her 20th loan, she is borrowing 10,000 PHP to fund her business operations so that she can continue to save for the future needs of her family.

is a widow living in Kabankalan City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating a general store. She has six children between 40 and 50 years old. Constancia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1997 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 19 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Constancia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 5,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 3,500 PHP, raising her family's standard of living. This time, for her 20th loan, she is borrowing 15,000 PHP to purchase more stock to sell so that she can continue to save for her future business and family needs. Constancia is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means honorable).

Her husband is working in their vulcanizing shops. Heligena has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 8,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Heligena joined Kiva partner HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Heligena has successfully repaid a previous loan of 12,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase materials needed to expand services provided. Heligena is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP which will be used to purchase materials needed for the maintenance of the service. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Heligena from HSPFI.

is a married woman who lives in Bantayan, Cebu. She earns her living by operating one business: a general store  .Her husband, Juanito, who is 62 years-old, works as a Driver to earn his living.  They have five children who are 25 to 32 years old. Three of their children have their own families.\r\n\r\nTeresita joined Kiva partner NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 15 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Teresita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 5,000,  uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 16th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 19,500, and she plans to buy stock for her general store so that she can continue to save up for future improvement of her business.\r\n\r\nTeresita is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).
