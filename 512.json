This couple has two children, both of whom are dependent upon their parents. The children are aged 13 years old and 11 years old. Nelly and her husband work hard but their income is very small and they didn't even have capital to start up a business. \r\n\r\nIn 2003, Nelly heard about ASHI. Her dream of having a stable life with a stable house and to start a business became possible. When she received her first and succeeding loans from ASHI, Nelly started her own business of a fruit stall in the local community. It has been a few long years now that she has had this kind of business. The fruit stall has been a great help to her family. As a busy entrepreneur, Nelly also embarked on a tricycle (motorcycle with sidecar) transport business. Her husband manages this business.\r\n\r\nHowever, the demands of her family grows as the years go by. So, she now aspires to have another business that can add to her present income in order to have bigger profits and more savings. She came up with the idea of operating sari-sari (variety) store. It has been a great success! Nelly earned a good income and she wants to have more investment in the sari-sari store. For her 12th loan, she is proposing a new loan amounting to PHP 40,000.00 to expand her three ventures. The loan fund will specifically be used to purchase an inventory of groceries for her store, more stock of fruits to sell, and support the maintenance of their tricycle. \r\n\r\nWith this kind of business, Nelly can still manage her previous fruit stall business because either she or her husband can operate their sari-sari (variety) store at home. Someday, as her income increases, she dreams of funding her children\u2019s education until they each complete a college degree and have professional jobs in the future. Her greatest dreams are of lifting her family out of poverty and to have happy living.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":582.75,"image":{"id":661773,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

This will be her 3rd loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 7000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Gina aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and to ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Y. is a married woman who lives in Barangay Malis, Brooke's Point, Palawan. She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  a general store and copra (dried coconut meat). Her husband Alvin Y., who is 31 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have one child who is 1 year old. \r\n\r\nTenocra joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 12 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Tenocra has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 29,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 18,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 13th loan, she is borrowing PHP 29,500, with which she intends to buy inventory of general store products so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her only child. She also hopes that it will improve her business. Tenocra Y. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

is twenty-eight years old and married with one 18 month old child. He is a farmer from the town of Kitale in western Kenya where he has been farming for 6 years. His farm produces milk, maize, beans, vegetables and potatoes which he sells to the local market. He mainly depends on the income from his farming to cater for the needs of his family.\r\n\r\nHe has requested this loan of 31,200 KES from Juhudi Kilimo to purchase and insure a dairy cow. He says that the extra income from this loan will help him take care of the basic needs of his family and also invest in other businesses. Fluctuations in the market prices of farm produce and diseases which are too costly to treat have been his biggest challenges. In the future, he plans to venture into zero grazing and improve his milk production.\r\n\r\nHe hopes that Juhudi will continue funding farmers in order to improve their standards of living.

E. is from the village of Sibutad. She is 31 years old, married and has one school-aged child. To make a living, Mila owns and operates a food stall. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling viand (cooked meats) and other delicacies in the local community. Mila has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Mila joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Mila has successfully repaid a previous loan of 650 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used for personal purposes. Mila is requesting her 4th loan of 14,900 PHP, which will be used to invest for the expansion of her business. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Eliza C. is from the village of Bagakay, Sibutad. She is 35 years old. Eliza is the group leader of a 2-member group loan offered by PMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nEliza is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Eliza owns and operates a business venture in the food sector producing rice to sell. Eliza has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Eliza joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Eliza has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase pesticides for the farm. Eliza is requesting her 6th loan of 12,000 PHP, which will be used as additional capital for rice production. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva

C. is from the village of Rizal,Jimenez,Misamis Occidental.

Linda is requesting a new loan of 3,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional fish to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Linda from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

Shiela has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 2,500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Shiela joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.

Shiela is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional fish to sell. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Shiela from GDMPC.

Tr\u01b0\u01a1ng Th\u1ecb T. (20209050047) is a 30 year-old female living in the town of huy\u1ec7n Y\u00ean Phong - B\u1eafc Ninh.  She is married and has 2 school-aged children.  To making a living, T. owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising chickens for sale.  T. has been engaged in this business for over 6 years and earns approximately 3.200.000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, T. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  T. has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5.600.000 VND from SEDA.  This previous loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise & sell in future.  T. is now requesting a new loan of 8.288.000 VND which will be used to purchase livestock feed & other supplies.  The loan will be the 4th loan taken out by the borrower from SEDA.  T. plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand the borrower's business.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout SEDA:\r\n\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to the low income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the Northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n\r\nT.

Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb (20209050044) is a 57 year-old female living in the town of huy\u1ec7n Y\u00ean Phong - B\u1eafc Ninh.  She is married and has 4 adult children.  To make a living, S\u1eed owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector operating a clothing business.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from providing general clothing services to local community members.  S\u1eed has been engaged in this business for over 13 years and earns approximately 2.800.000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2008, S\u1eed joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  S\u1eed has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5.600.000 VND from SEDA.  This previous loan was used to purchase additional inventory & working capital.  S\u1eed is now requesting a new loan of 8.288.000 VND which will be used to invest in renovating the business.  The loan will be the 4th loan taken out by the borrower from SEDA.  S\u1eed plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand the borrower's business.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout SEDA:\r\n\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to the low income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the Northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n\r\nS\u1eed Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb (20209050044) l\u00e0 57 tu\u1ed5i n\u1eef.

To making a living, C. owns & operates a specialized retail store.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling liquor such as beer & wine in the local community.

C. has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6.048.000 VND from SEDA.  This previous loan was used to purchase new items to expand product offering.  C. is now requesting a new loan of 8.736.000 VND which will be used to purchase additional products to sell.  The loan will be the 4th loan taken out by the borrower from SEDA.

She is from the village of Landing, Baliangao. \r\n\r\nIn 2005, Tessie joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Tessie has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase farm supplies.

This loan will be the 12th loan taken out by Tessie from PMPC. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb (20209050045) is a 29-year-old female living in the town of Huy\u1ec7n Y\u00ean Phong - B\u1eafc Ninh.  She is married and has 2 school-aged children.  To making a living, T. owns & operates a business venture raising livestock.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for sale.  T. has been engaged in this business for over 5 years and earns approximately 3.800.000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, T. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  T. has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5.600.000 VND from SEDA.  This previous loan was used to purchase livestock feed & other supplies.  T. is now requesting a new loan of 8.288.000 VND which will be used to build shelter for the borrower's livestock.  The loan will be the 4th loan taken out by the borrower from SEDA.  T. plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the borrower's business.\r\n\r\nAbout SEDA:\r\n\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to the low income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the Northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n\r\nT.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.  The official name of this borrowing group is Trung B\u1ea1n (3).\r\n\r\n\r\nD. is married and has 2 adult -aged children.  To making a living, D. raises livestock.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for sale.  D. has been engaged in this business for over 22 years and earns approximately 1.800.000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2007, D. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  D. has successfully repaid a previous loan of 2.464.000 VND from SEDA.  This previous loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise & sell in future.  She is now requesting a new loan of 6.496.000 VND which will be used to purchase livestock feed & other supplies.  The loan will be the 5th loan taken out by the borrower from SEDA.  D. plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of the her family.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the Other Borrowers in the Group:\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

S. is a 62-year old widow who supports her family by operating a candle making and selling business. She lives in Buntol, Brgy. Monta\u00f1eza, Malabuyoc, Cebu. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2004 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her candle making and selling business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 5,000. Nomeriana is now borrowing PHP 10,000 so that she can purchase raw materials. This will be her ninth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 7,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Nomeriana aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

They have an average age of 28 years and 3 children and live in Heremakono-Nord in the city of BOUGOUNI (third administrative region of Mali).  They know each other through community and business ties.  They sell various items: peanut paste, condiments, hand-knit wools etc.  They also prepare and sell fruit juices.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Good quality items and attractive prices have allowed him to establish and maintain his clientele base, and the resulting stable income has allowed him to improve the family's living conditions. <p>\r\n\r\nToday Ilhomjon requests $2000 USD to purchase additional goods to sell.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<p>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<p>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They live in large traditional families with their husbands, children and co-wives. On average, they are 42 years old, married and have at least 3 children.The S\u00e9rieux  group buys and sells cosmetics, clothing, firewood and fruits and vegetables.  In order to expand their businesses, the group decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso loan program. They just had their first group loan.  Awa Kamat\u00e9, who is the leader of the group, buys and sells clothing.    She is in high demand because she is located at a good place at the Darsalam market.  She plans to use her loan to buy different kinds of clothing. She obtains these goods wholesale at the Koutiala Grand Market and sells them retail for cash and credit to a largely female clientele. While the other S\u00e9rieux group members expect to make a profit of 55,000 CFA each during this cycle, Awa Kamat\u00e9 expects to make 65,000 CFA.  As well as repaying the loans, they use  part of their  income to provide for their families\u2019 everyday expenses.

Dios' 1, 2 & 3 (God Blessing), a group of Haitian immigrants living in the rural areas surrounding La Romana, where the sugarcane harvest and the tourist industry dominate the economy. This area, like nearly all impoverished areas of the Dominican Republic, suffers from unreliable running water (none of which is potable) and electricity that can't be counted on. She lives in a modest home with her husband and two children. She says that her most difficult challenge is the divorce process she is facing right now and the effect on their children. In the meantime, she plans to continue to enjoy doing business.<p>\r\n\r\nSylvenia is excited to be taking out her seventh loan with Esperanza after having repaid her previous loan and grown her business. She has had her business for more than nine years, starting with her own resources when she was living in Haiti. She plans to use this loan to invest in her business by buying bed cloths, curtains, clothing, etc. Sylvenia will re-invest the profits in her business. She dreams of building her own house.<p>\r\n\r\nThis Esperanza associate began with us because her business needed capital to grow, and her story is representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican clients generally, many of whom recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti.

She makes her home here in a simple structure with her long-term partner and four children. She enjoys reading; in her free time, this is her hobby. She says that her most difficult challenge is to educate her children.\r\n\r\nClara is excited to be taking her second loan with Esperanza after having successfully repaid her previous loan and grown her business. She has had her business for 8 month. She was starting to use her savings to run her 'Comedor' (small restaurant in the neighborhood, especially for lunch). After starting, she heard about Esperanza\u00b4s loans and decided to be part of the program. She plans to use this new loan to invest in her business by buying a bag of rice, 10 plastic chairs, and 3 tables. She will use the profits to reinvest in her business and she is dreaming of having her own restaurant in the town. \r\n\r\nHer story is representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican clients, many of whom recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti. Her group is located in the urban slums surrounding Santo Domingo. This area, like nearly all impoverished areas of the Dominican Republic, suffers from unreliable electricity and running water (none of which is potable).

By the time he was 18 years old, he ran a lawn care service making $600 a day, 3 days a week, \u201cYou can imagine the kind of trouble I got in\u201d, says Jason. Jason subsequently attempted to start two other businesses which did not take off. He says, \u201cI will be a serial entrepreneur until I\u2019m successful and I will keep trying. I have ideas all the time.\u201d\r\n\r\nJason started working for Perot Systems, which is now under Dell, as an analyst. He currently works for Dell and has recently had another entrepreneurial urge. He kept all of his landscaping materials so that when his three sons were old enough, they could start landscaping themselves. It was important to Jason that his sons learn a trade and he therefore created another business, Cowboy Irrigation. Every Saturday, Jason was teaching his kids how to irrigate, but they said, \u201cDad, this irrigation stuff is hard. Why can\u2019t we do something else?\u201d Jason told his children, \u201cLet\u2019s think about what you\u2019re good at, and then let\u2019s figure out a way to make money from that.\u201d Out of this discussion, Jason and his kids developed the idea for Gameboys.  \r\n\r\nJason\u2019s kids, Jack, Trent, Beau and Shealan, had invaluable input in designing the trailers. \u201cThis is me being a father and finding a way to be involved with my kids and teach them something that is productive. My purpose in life is to give them the best possible chance of being successful. I\u2019ve led by example.\u201d\r\n\r\nJason\u2019s bank referred him to ACCION Texas-Louisiana and Jason was shocked by the reasonable interest rate. Jason says, \u201cThere are a lot of people out there who have great ideas. We need people and companies that will stand behind those people\u2026. I applaud ACCION for finding avenues to trust me.\u201d\r\n\r\nJason eventually would like to build these mobile video game trailers and sell them to franchises and help them set up across the

He lives with his wife and their three children in the village of Palominos in the district of Tambogrande.  It is a semi-tropical zone primarily populated by small farmers and ranchers.  Many residents own small fruit plantations and raise cattle or other smaller animals.  The family maintains a stable and happy home.\r\n\r\nJose and his family raise sheep, turkeys and chickens in corrals near their home.  These animals provide meat, eggs and ongoing production.  Jose raises them up to the appropriate size and then sells them to neighbors or in the local markets.  In addition, Jose manages a hectare of land on which he has mango and lime planted.  He harvests the fruit on a regular basis given the year-round growing season in the area and sells the fruit in local markets or to local factories.\r\n\r\nThis will be Jose\u2019s first loan with Kiva's partner, Edpyme Alternitiva.

Her previous loan of 7,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 20,000 PHP thus uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her fourth loan, she is borrowing 10,000 PHP to purchase more merchandise to sell to be able to continue to save for the future and meet her family\u2019s needs.\r\n\r\nMelinda G. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word meaning honorable).

Tacup, San Remegio, Cebu.  She earns her living by operating two business ventures: food vending and general store businesses.  She has five children who are 6 to 17 years old.  Maria Vita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family.  With the help of her past 5 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Maria Vita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow.  \r\n\r\nHer previous loan of PHP 14,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 7,600, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 6th loan, she is borrowing PHP 20,000 which she intends to use to purchase raw materials so that she can continue to save up for the future and the education of her children.  Maria Vita B. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

She lives in Calma, Brgy. Malbago, Daanbantayan, Cebu.  She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2010 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts.  \r\n\r\nBy working hard in her fishing \/ fish Vending business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable.  She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 10,000.  Miguelita is now borrowing PHP 10,000 so that she can purchase more fishing gear and equipment. This will be her 2nd loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 3,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom.  Miguelita aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the  Dungganon way.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\n In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures:  a general store and  a livestock business. Her husband Mario, who is 42 years old, earns a living as a carpenter and also helps with his wife's business activities.  They have 3 children who are between 17 and 20 years old.  \r\n\r\nMa.Elena joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1995 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 23 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Ma.Elena has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 11,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6,000, improving the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 24th loan cycle, she is borrowing PHP 10,000 which she intends to use to buy stock for her general store.  This will allow her to continue saving up for the future expansion of her business and the education of her youngest child.  \r\n\r\nMa.Elena O. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through this program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are both collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if one is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nHarenerosa is married and has two adult-aged children. She makes a living by running a sari-sari (general) store. She has been in this business for more than 7 years and earns about 2,700 PHP a month from her work.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Herenerosa joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her life and ability to engage in business. She has successfully repaid two previous loans from PMPC, and used each of them to buy goods for her retail store. She and her loan group are applying for a new loan, for 8,000 PHP, to buy additional products to sell. She plans to use the additional revenue generated by her business to improve her family's living conditions.\r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Paradeo is a married woman who lives in Barangay Tagbino, Vallehermoso, Negros Oriental. She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures:  buying and selling fruit and selling Avon products.  Her husband Pepito, who is 47 years old, earns a living as a carpenter and also helps with his wife's business activities.  They have three children between 5 to 12 years old. \r\n\r\nVicenta joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1999 because she aspired for something better for her family.  With the help of her past 9 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Vicenta  has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 12,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, improving the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 10th loan cycle, she is borrowing PHP 15,000 which she intends to use as additional working capital for fruit-selling and for livestock.  This will allow her to continue to save for the future education of her children.  Vicenta Paradeo is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

She earns her living by operating a grocery store business.  Her husband Eddie, who is 48 years old, works as a transport mechanic to earn a living.  They have two children who are 17 and 20 years old.\r\n\r\nRosemarie joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1999 because she aspired for something better for her family.  With the help of her past 21 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Rosemarie has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow.  Her previous loan of PHP 19,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 12,000, improving the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 22nd loan cycle, she is borrowing PHP 19,500 which she intends to use to buy stocks of peanuts and dry goods for her grocery store so that she can continue to save for the future education of her children. Rosemarie S. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through this program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

 V. is a 51-year old married woman who supports her family by operating a dried fish production business.  She lives in Roma, Barangay Batya, EB Magalona, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2008 and has improved her living conditions with the help of loans from NWTF and through her own efforts.  By working hard in her  dried fish production business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 6,000. \r\n\r\nNonie is now borrowing PHP 12,000 so that she can continue to fund the operations of her business.   This will be her 6th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon.  Her previous loan of PHP 12,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom. Nonie  aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the  Dungganon way.   \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through this program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

This time, for her 18th loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000, which she intends to use to buy fertilizer for her rice field to save up for future improvements of her business.

To make a living, Cita owns and operates a business providing karaoke services (where customers pay 5 pesos per song) and a billiard hall to local community members. Cita has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 12,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Cita joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Cita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 17,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase materials needed for the maintenance of the service.\r\n\r\nCita is requesting a new loan of 19,000 PHP which will be used to purchase materials needed for the maintenance of the billiard table. This loan will be the 6th loan taken out by Cita from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\n<b>About HSPFI:<\/b>\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.
