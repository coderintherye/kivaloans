This loan will be her sixth from HSPFI.

In the photo she\u2019s in the middle of the group and is wearing a white blouse and black vest; the other group members are pointing at her.  She has been selling used clothes and toys in the market for the last two years.  She works every weekend in the market and sporadically cares for two senior citizens in a private home.  She buys her merchandise in various places, whichever is the most economically convenient.  She intends to use this loan to buy a bundle of clothes (a large package of used clothes).\r\n\r\nHer goal for her business is to get a large awning to use as protection during the winter because of the rain and in summer because of the intense heat because currently Gabriela arranges her wares on a piece of cloth in the street.\r\n\r\nShe lives with her 26-year-old daughter who helps her on weekends with the clothing sales.  Her personal dreams are to become economically independent and to get a locale of her own to work in.\r\n\r\nGabriela is very grateful for the loan granted by Fondo Esperanza because it will make it possible for her to invest in her business.  Besides, she feels very comfortable in the group of entrepreneurs because they are neighbors and known to her.  Because of this, the meetings are very pleasant and they support each other quite a bit.   With respect to the workshops conducted, Gabriela has learned how to better distribute income earned from her business.\r\n\r\nValpara\u00edso is located 120 kilometers northeast of Santiago.  It is the regional capital and also the legislative seat of the country.

She and her husband, Fortunato, 34, live with their 2 children, Dennis, 12, and Erick, 3, in a house that they own.  Dolores and Fortunato are the bedrock of the family and their home is one where harmony is the rule.  Dolores learned farming from her parents when she was just a girl.  She's a \"campesina\", a country girl, with 4 hectares of land where she plants coffee and platanos.  Both crops are native to Peru's Rio Apurimac Valley.  She started working her own land 6 years ago.  She hires seasonal workers to help her harvest her crop and carry it to market.  Her favorite thing about farming is harvesting her crop because it makes all of the hard work that came before worthwhile. Her most difficult challenge is getting her crop to market because she has to deliver it to buyers in Kimbiri and San Francisco, the two towns where she can get the best price for the crop.  She is applying for loan, which she will combine with her own savings, to buy a plot of land in the city of Ayacucho.  In the future, she wants to buy even more land and increase her production of coffee.  This is Dolores's first MFP loan.  She knows that if she repays it on time, she'll have an easier time getting future loans.  She will use the loan, for 3,000 new soles, to buy a plot of land in Ayacucho."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":738347,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Comprar un terreno en Ayacucho.

She lives in her own home with her husband H\u00e9ctor, age 52, and their two beloved children for whom she wants to provide a better quality of life.  Julia works very hard on her farm to provide everything she needs to support her family.  Before the first rays of sunlight appear, she leaves her house and walks almost an hour before reaching her land where she grows potatoes, corn, and peas.  These products are eventually sold at the wholesale market in the city of Tarma.  What she enjoys most about her work is cultivating her land, which she feels has been put to good use.  Julia has been farming for thirty years and considers the most difficult part to be transporting her products to Tarma because the sacks are heavy and the work is tiring.  Within time, she wants to buy additional farmland so that she can increase her production.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is her second loan with MFP.

The bulk of Pete\u2019s (Pedro's) business comes from repairing outdoor power equipment, e.g., lawn mowers, weed eaters, power sprayers, or anything else with a small engine. Pete picks up, repairs, and returns the equipment for one price. If the customer decides not to have Pete fix the equipment, Pete charges a small fee to compensate for his time and fuel. If the customer has Pete fix the equipment, Pete waives the consultation charge.\r\n\r\nPete keeps his advertising costs low, preferring instead to let his reputation bring him business. With approximately 500 clients, Pete says he stays busy throughout the lawn care season, which in Texas usually lasts nine months. When winter comes, Pete does home repairs for his customers. He says that he does all general repairs except work that requires extensive electrical or plumbing know-how. On average, he says that about 75% of his business comes from repairing lawn equipment with about 25% from home repairs. \r\n\r\nAnother aspect of Pete\u2019s Enterprises is salvaging miscellaneous materials and items people no longer want. Through word of mouth, Pete says people learn to call him when they have something they want to get rid of. He picks the items up and takes them to his store which serves as his repair shop and doubles as a storefront for the salvaged goods. He sells what he can, and gives the rest to individuals in need.\r\n\r\nThis loan from ACCION Texas-Louisiana serves as operating capital for Pete to meet business expenses. Even with the home repairs that Pete does, business is slower for Pete during the winter. Pete keeps a full array of parts in his inventory at all times. This loan helps Pete buy inventory so that he is ready when the lawn-mowing season gets under way. Eventually, Pete wants to hire a full-time associate whom he can train to help him handle the volume of service calls. He advertises through Yellow Pages which has his business\u2019 information and also shows customer feedback.

She has had her business for about 10 years; she started it by using her savings to buy clothing to sell.\r\n\r\nYeimi is planning to use her new loan to buy jeans, blouses, underwear, and shirts.

Her dream is to have her own store and a family.\r\n\r\nThis Esperanza associate started with us because she is interesting to progress with her business and she will do it thought the loans. Her history is being used to exemplify the other group members as well as clients of Esperanza, both the Haitians (who for the most part have emigrated to the Dominican Republic from Haiti, some of them quite recently) as well as the Dominicans who generally live in very poor communities like this zone, and many others like it in the Dominican Republic which have few resources; they lack drinking water and reliable electricity.\r\n\r\nThis group is located in an area of few resources called Puerto Plata, a city whose economy depends primarily on real estate and tourism, although the latter has recently been overshadowed by new, emerging tourist areas.

","en":"Yisel is a woman who adapts quickly to the circumstances.  She was born in the mountain of San Antonio in the department of Magdalena, and for 21 years she has lived in Soledad in the department of Atlantico.  Her partner is also self-employed and even though Yisel has 10 years of sales experience, she only began her drink business 5 years ago, and one year ago she started selling cosmetics, perfumes, deodorant creams and jewelry.  Both business still have great potential for growth.  Her main customers live in her neighborhood and in communities nearby.  She has good clientele to whom she sells up to 20 cases of beer on the weekends.  She also has a stock of cosmetic products and jewelry, most of which she bought on sale so that she could offer her customers alternatives at better prices, and therefore be able to compete in the market.  Yisel currently has a good level of sales that has allowed her to cover operating costs and part of her family expenses.  Her financial statements show a profit and good margin of contribution.  On her general balance sheet, the outstanding accounts are highlighted along with inventory, mainly maD. up of the cosmetic products since the majority of beer sales are managed in cash.   Currently she is applying for her first Kiva loan, money which she will use to buy a bottle holder, a glass showcase, and also to invest in some business capital.

Ruby is a very energetic and hardworking woman.  She sells a little bit of everything.  Ruby can be found making fried foods such as <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Arepa\" target=\"_blank\" ><i>arepas<\/i><\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Empanada\" target=\"_blank\" ><i>empandas<\/i><\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Carima%C3%B1ola\" target=\"_blank\" ><i>carima\u00f1olas<\/i><\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hallaca\" target=\"_blank\" ><i>hayacas<\/i><\/a>, and often at the same time so that she can sell them in the Department of Sucre in Colombia.  With her traveling papers in hand, she also brings with her merchandise such as clothing, sandals, silver jewelry, and other accessories to sell while she is there.  When she returns home, she brings back with her boxes of cheese, avocados, and even \u201c<i>diabolines<\/i>\u201d (delicious toasted cheese snacks that are made in Sucre and sold in the city of Soledad).  All of this activity in her life is a result of managing a store for twelve years.  She became accustomed to performing a great deal of work each day and now she cannot quit.  After her store closed down, she began selling soups from the doorstep of her house.    She also started bringing various types of merchandise to Corozal in the Department of Sucre to take advantage of the market owned by her relatives who live there.  Upon her return home, she brought back \u201c<i>diabolines<\/i>\u201d, cheese, and avocados to sell.  These businesses generated good results and she continues to manage them.  \r\n<p>\r\nRuby has participated in the programs of Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo for one year.  Her previous loan replaced other expensive loans, one with a monthly interest rate of 10%.  This new loan had a lower rate and more favorable terms.  At the moment, she is requesting her second loan from the organization in order to buy clothing, flour, cheese, \u201c<i>diabolines<\/i>\u201d, and oil.

He teaches classes in electric guitar, acoustics, keyboard, music theory, vocal technique, and ear training at home with two of his university classmates.  Five years ago, Hugo started a group called \u201cCACTOPUS\u201d in which he is the composer and guitarist for the band.  His music addresses social issues and fuses different rhythms.  The group has made appearances in bars and caf\u00e9s throughout Bogota, and has received attention as a result of magazine interviews and other forms of publicity.  Its style is described as \u201ccari\u00f1ito en rock\u201d which is well-known among followers of this genre.  The goal of the group is to achieve recognition on a national level for its fusion of traditional rhythms.  \r\n<p>\r\nCACTOPUS is a project for young people and adults that was created five years ago.  Hugo Andr\u00e9s is a composer, singer, and guitarist who is able to fuse the rhythms of rock music and the rhythmic beats of <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Capoeira\" target=\"_blank\" >Capoeira<\/a> with traditional music.  His dream is for CACTOPUS to attain international recognition for its new Latin American style.  Hugo\u2019s main challenge has been generating publicity through commercial broadcast media because he believes the industry is monopolized, thereby making his work difficult.  As a business, CACTOPUS generates income through the classes Hugo teaches at home and from appearances at bars and restaurants.  The group\u2019s assets include musical equipment, amplifiers, and some music CDs that have been produced.  Hugo Andr\u00e9s and his group want to record nine songs for the upcoming album launch, on which he is currently working.  This will be the first album the group has launched, but the group has already released three singles that were well-received based on the sales that were made whenever they performed at bars and hamburger joints.  Students of his classes have also bought these recordings, as well as attendees of performances at various sites in which they conduct every eight days.\r\n<p>\r\nHugo has gone to the beautiful Colombian capital of Bogota to request a Kiva loan because he needs to invest in the cost of recording the album, pressing and copying the CDs, and designing and paying for cover art.\r\n  \r\n

Before the first rays of sun are visible, she leaves her home and walks for nearly an hour and a half to reach her farmland where she grows potatoes, peas, beans and olluco (a native tuber), crops which she then takes to the wholesale market in the city of Tarma to sell.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, Lucinda owns a restaurant.  This business helps her a lot in terms of income since her establishment is very popular with her neighbors.  What Lucinda most likes about her work is cultivating her land because she feels that she is putting it to good use.  She has been in this business for 31 years and she considers the most difficult part of her work to be transporting her produce to Tarma since the sacks she carries are very heavy and make her very tired.\r\n\r\nOver time, Lucinda would like to set up a grocery store which will help her to improve her financial situation.

She moved to the town of Esteli when she was 3 years old.  She's a single mother with 4 children, all now grown.  Maria has been a merchant for 30 years.  At first, she sold ice, buying plastic bags that she packed with ice and sold on.  Now she sells clothing, cosmetics, shoes, silver jewelry, etc.  Before starting the business, she was a social worker at the hospital in Esteli for 10 years.  In those days, she used to go to Guatemala and bring back perfumes, silver jewelry, etc. that she then sold to her co-workers.  The money that she earned allowed her to better support her children.  Now she goes to Panama where she buys products such as cosmetics, clothing, shoes, purses and jewelry.  She sells on both the wholesale and retail markets.  She also gets t-shirts from a son in Costa Rica.\r\nMaria is applying for a loan so that she can buy other products such as cell phones.  She's never sold cell phones before but she can see that they're an everday product now, something that everyone needs.

He started his business 7 years ago when he was 25, at first growing tomatoes over one 'manzana' (just over 1.5 acres) of land.  Half of the money he used for this was his own and the rest was from a loan.  Westfall used to be an elementary school English and gym teacher but then he started growing crops full time.  He also grows sweet peppers.\r\n\r\nThese days, Westfall owns 5 'manzanas' (just over 8 acres) of land and has 3 workers who help him.  His dad and brother also help him in his business.

He distributes his products in Sebaco and the city of Estel\u00ed. \r\n\r\nWestfall requested this loan to buy soluble manure which he will use on his tomato crop.  With this investment, he hopes to harvest 2,500 small crates of tomatoes which will make him good profits and satisfy the demand of his buyers (he exports his produce to Managua, Salvador and Honduras).  He also hopes to improve his yield.\r\n\r\nSome of Westfall's future plans are to buy a work truck, to do better maintenance work on his tractor and to buy another 'manzana' of land so that he can expand his crop.

She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1,963,500 VND from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.

For the past ten years, she and her family have resided there in a two-room brick house in the area of Tahliwala. \r\n\r\nShe has applied for a loan from the Kiva partner, Asasah, to improve her business of selling clothes. She started this business after the death of her husband, C. M., some years ago. It was a time of great difficulty for her but she recovered her senses and started this business to bear the financial burden of her family. \r\n\r\nShe is the mother of a son and a daughter. She worked very hard for the continuation of her children\u2019s education.

It is the place where Gulnaz and her husband grew up, married and established a family of three children. In 11 years of marriage, the family has made several attempts at starting a business, all in vain until eight years ago when they found the means to open a salon to provide computer services.<p>\r\n\r\nIn a small town many residents don\u2019t have access to either the Internet or a personal computer. The salon has become a very reliable means of communication with the outside world, and Gulnaz\u2019s customers include youth who come to enjoy computer games or social networks and adults who use e-mail and office supplies. <p>\r\n\r\nThe business was started with capital of 60,000 soms to purchase six computers.  Gulnaz has since improved arrangements in the salon and expanded the business, resulting in a monthly income of 30,000 soms which has allowed her to purchase a long-waited apartment. Gulnaz\u2019s portion of this loan will be used to buy necessary parts for the computers and a central processing unit. <p>\r\n\r\n         --- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan.

Until 2007 Dogdurkan worked in Telecom: the main communication center of the country. Having retired with honors she now receives a pension of 2,000 soms.\r\n\r\nFour years ago, Dogdurkan invested her savings in purchasing goods for her new business of reselling gasoline. She purchases it from suppliers at a good price, gets a license and resells it to local consumers. Dogdurkan is proud of herself. She happens to have good entrepreneurial skills and the intuition of a true business lady. Her biggest pride is a piece of land that she bought recently on which to build the house of her dreams. Her monthly income is 7,600 soms and she believes this is not the limit. \r\n\r\nDogdurkan, like other members of her team, treats this opportunity very responsibly and believes in repaying the loan on time without any violations. The purpose of the loan is to purchase more gasoline for resale at a higher price. \r\n\r\n         --- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

She lives in a small village, Kochkorka, known as \u201csleepy little Kyrgyz village\u201d because of its quietness and security. Kaiyrsa is the mother of three sons, the youngest of whom is physically disabled and needs special treatment and care. The others work in the capital and live on their own. \r\n\r\nKaiyrsa is a farmer and has various types of cattle. She received these assets in 1992 during times of privatization and, since then, has dramatically increased the number of livestock she owns. Nineteen years ago her start up capital was 10,000 soms, and now generates 5,000 soms a month. It has a small effect because of high inflation. \r\n\r\nShe plans to use the loan from Kiva to buy another head of cattle and, hopefully, to resell it at a good price. The long-term goals of Kaiyrsa include making major repairs to her house and arranging the wedding ceremony for her son. \r\n\r\n         --- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

K. was born in the village of Kozhoke (in the Osh area of the Kirghiz Republic). She is 42 years old. Nazira and her spouse are raising three remarkable children. Nazira was born into a simple family in which she was the eldest; therefore, she had many chores: looking after younger brothers and sisters, doing housework, and helping on the farm. As a child, Nazira dreamed of becoming a pediatrician, but, alas, life forced her onto another path.  However, today she says her daughter will absolutely become a doctor.  \r\n\r\nWhen she was eighteen, Nazira got married.  By Kirghiz tradition, newly-married couples live in the parents\u2019 house, and Nazira\u2019s husband was a younger son.  Nazira\u2019s husband worked hard on a collective farm; she worked taking care of the family\u2019s livestock, and by then they already had two children. Unfortunately, the 400-square-meter plot of land allocated to each family was not sufficient to plant enough crops to turn a profit.  \r\n\r\nIn 2001, after her parents\u2019 funeral, Nazira\u2019s family moved to the Chuysky valley, into the village of Alekseyevka. Here the couple bought a house with a vegetable garden and bought two milk cows. Income from delivering milk and selling vegetables became Nazira\u2019s family\u2019s livelihood.  Ten years have passed since then, and the family has endured many trials, but thanks to persistence and diligence they are no longer in grave financial condition. Today, on their small farm, there are four calves being fattened, one milk cow, and the family is now cultivating onions.   Nazira is taking out a loan for 100,000 som (KGS) to buy two calves and some ewes. This will allow Nazira to increase her livestock and to expand the farm. In the future, Nazira and her husband dream of giving their children a good education and building a big house.  \r\n\r\n\r\nBai-Tushum and Partners uses Kiva funding to target the especially vulnerable population.

is 45 years old and lives with her three children in Ulaanbataar, the capital city of Mongolia. They all live together in small wooden house on their plot of land. \r\n\r\nTsetsegmaa is left to raise her three children after her husband passed away in 2008. Her older daughter, Davaadulam, works at the state emergency department and her younger two sons are attending a university.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n \r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n \r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n \r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n \r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n \r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with access to the varied financial services they need.
