Because it is one of the closest cities to the capital, it is a tourist area. These women work in different activities; three sell tortillas which they make and sell from home to others who use them to make desserts which are sold to the tourists  and go well with this product. The only one with a store is Ms Tania del Socorro. Celia is the group's coordinator. She was chosen because of her responsibility. She is 43 years old, and has learned her trade since she was young. She is the mother of 4 children, two of whom live with her. Her children assist in selling and in making tortillas. She says that through loans she has increased her sales as she has gained customers  and increased her profit margin while improving conditions in her shop. She has benefited from the Adin trainings, which have helped her to improve the appearance of her and of her business. She encourages the members of the group to make their payments and progress. She dreams of improving her home and of providing her children  with an education. Her husband helps her with the expenses of home, working as a craftsman in the neighboring town of Niquinohomo. She says \"The business, however, is mine.\"The group understands the need for prompt payment and unity to keep enjoying the benefits of these loans, as no other organization will lend without collateral, the reason for which they have never worked with loans in the past. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by James Comstock, Kiva

She is the mother of three teenagers; her children help her prepare the tortillas, slaughter the pigs and prepare the nacamatales. Her husband helps her with the household expenses. He works for a food company as a security guard. \r\n\r\nShe works every day. Weekends she works selling the pork and the nacamatales. She comments that she feels well treated by Adim because she feels among friends and Adim teaches her to improve her business and herself, as a person. Previously she was a person who did not know that her work had much value. In the training courses she learned a lot of new things. This has motivated her to move her business ahead and be punctual with her loan payments. She dreams of improving her home and her workplace. She also dreams that her children will complete their studies.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Erin Corcoran, Kiva

Como si fuera poco tambi\u00e9n ha incursionado en el alquiler de cuartos, ya que sus hijos se fueron dejando las habitaciones vac\u00edas, decidi\u00f3 aprovechar y darlas en alquiler.

","en":"64-year old Edelmira lives with her 28-year old son Javier; her four other children have already left home and have their own families. She earns her living by selling food in the small restaurant she has opened in her home. There she attends her customers who come every day to eat her delicious meals. She\u2019s been doing this work for 20 years, serving a variety of dishes such as barbecued chicken and chicharron (traditional pork dish). Now, as her client base is continuing to grow, she does not want to lower the quality of the service she provides. She also needs time to raise guinea pigs. It is for this reason that one of her daughters-in-law often comes to help with this task. As if that weren\u2019t enough, she has also ventured into the business of renting out rooms\u2014when her children left home, they left behind unused rooms, so she decided to take advantage of the situation and rent them out. Edelmira hopes to be able to continue working for some time; as she herself says she still has the strength to do a lot herself, but in the future she would like to have a small store where she can serve customers without rushing around and in the process make some good friends.\r\n\r\nThis is her third loan with Kiva partner, Microfinanzas Prisma, and she has always been very punctual with her repayments. With the loan she will buy a greater quantity of food so she can make more dishes; with the rest of the money she will renovate and paint some rooms to rent out and in this way earn more money.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jane Agg, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":294848,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"To buy supplies for her restaurant","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-04-03T15:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edelmira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-04-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:48:21Z","rounded_local_amount":256.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012345,"comment":null},{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:01:52Z","rounded_local_amount":256.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595934,"comment":null},{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-06-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:42:16Z","rounded_local_amount":256.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990197,"comment":null},{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-07-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:43:36Z","rounded_local_amount":256.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211322,"comment":null},{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:24:10Z","rounded_local_amount":256.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640836,"comment":null},{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-09-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:37:55Z","rounded_local_amount":256.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080305,"comment":null},{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:09:55Z","rounded_local_amount":256.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996512,"comment":null},{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:55:06Z","rounded_local_amount":256.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842018,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-04-04T02:03:26Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T13:55:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":98168,"name":"Elena","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Elena tiene 57 a\u00f1os, es soltera vive con sus 6 hijos; Yobana de 34, Franco de 32, Pilar de 28, Ivan de 26, Luis de 24 y Blanca de 21 a\u00f1os en su casa propia.

She will use her present loan to purchase of materials like woods, nails, varnish, glass and many others.<p>\r\n \r\nThe couple wishes to expand their shop but they need more people to help her husband and capital to fill the customer's orders.

Phally S. lives in Krang Roung village in Takeo province. He is a construction worker. His wife, Mrs. Chhoem Chanthon, is a rice farmer who works their plot of land and also breeds pigs. She is 41 years old and the mother of three children who are attending the local school. Although they work hard, they have not been able to improve their family home.

Mrs. Sarorn L. is 52 years old and the mother of six children, one of whom is a cow breeder, another three of whom are laborers, and the rest are attending the local school."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":294951,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy fertilizer and gasoline for an irrigation pump.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":109,"posted_date":"2009-05-01T07:00:51Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sarorn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Thon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ngorn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sarin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Py","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nourn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Salat","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sophon","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":4800000,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":436800},{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":436800},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":436800},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":436800},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":436800},{"due_date":"2009-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":436800},{"due_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":436800},{"due_date":"2009-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":436800},{"due_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":436800},{"due_date":"2009-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":436800},{"due_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":432000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.92},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.92},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.92},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.92},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.92},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.92},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.92},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.92},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.92},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.92},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.8}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":320.78,"local_amount":1310400,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-26T07:43:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1317455,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44399913,"comment":null},{"amount":106.93,"local_amount":436800,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-19T07:41:42Z","rounded_local_amount":439151.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52907757,"comment":null},{"amount":106.93,"local_amount":436800,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T10:50:37Z","rounded_local_amount":439151.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63129721,"comment":null},{"amount":106.88,"local_amount":436800,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T11:30:00Z","rounded_local_amount":439151.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73553196,"comment":null},{"amount":106.92,"local_amount":436800,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T11:53:43Z","rounded_local_amount":439151.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86986911,"comment":null},{"amount":106.92,"local_amount":436800,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T12:58:29Z","rounded_local_amount":439151.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96899362,"comment":null},{"amount":106.92,"local_amount":436800,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T11:15:00Z","rounded_local_amount":439151.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103738418,"comment":null},{"amount":106.92,"local_amount":436800,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T11:40:00Z","rounded_local_amount":439151.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110625965,"comment":null},{"amount":105.8,"local_amount":432000,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T10:17:22Z","rounded_local_amount":434325.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118022714,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-05-19T02:42:11Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T10:17:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":98222,"name":"Faananafu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Faananafu I., 32, is married with 2 children.

farming is an economic activity dedicated to the raising of animals in order to generate revenue from the animals and the products they provide. Khudoiberdi has earned a living raising cattle since he was young. Now married, he has five children who, according to Khudoiberdi\u2019s words, are his reason for living. \r\n\r\nThe low incomes earned by people in this rural region aren't enough to maintain a family, and for this reason Khudoiberdi works enormously hard to provide a better standard of living for his wife and children. He now urgently needs to buy animals such as cows and calves and is therefore requesting a loan of $600 USD for a period of 12 months. Be an important part of the growth of Khudoiberdi\u2019s business.    \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes:  its role as a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets including Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous, and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment, forcing hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Iskandar has worked for many years in the difficult business of raising cattle. He is an exemplary husband in that he always tries his hardest to provide food for his wife and the three children in their home. After purchasing his cattle, Iskandar provides them with all the right conditions for their growth: taking care of their food and protection and making sure they don\u2019t get lost. Once they\u2019re fully mature, Iskandar sells them in his area and also provides their milk for sale. Currently he needs to purchase cattle to raise and for this reason is turning to IMON International to obtain a loan of $600. Iskandar thanks Kiva for the support that Kiva provides to small entrepreneurs.   \r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Davlat is a native of Penjikent, Tajikistan, and has stayed in her native land to progress there. That is why three years ago she decided to move forward with raising livestock. She began with just one cow and now has many.\r\n<p>\r\nEvery morning, Davlat goes out early so that her beloved cows may graze among the hills all day in hopes that they return happy and satisfied. Davlat is motivated to continue in this arduous work by the thought of her five children, who along with her husband, also help her with the cows.\r\n<p>\r\nIn order to succeed in her business, Davlat and her family look to nourish the animals and keep them happy, in hopes of ultimately selling them at a just price. Thanks to her continued activity in her occupation, Davlat and her family are able to sustain themselves and this fills Davlat with great satisfaction. However, with the support of this loan, she would now like to purchase more species of livestock to increase her clientele. With your support, Davlat will be able to accomplish her business goals and thus, help fund the education of all five of her children.    \r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It is also known for its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

K. is a humble man who works as a cattle farmer. He is motivated to work harder every day in order to provide for his young son. Cattle farming requires a lot of physical work, crossing long distances under the sun to transport the animals from one point to another. This can cause illnesses and weaken the body. Nevertheless, Samariddin continues to work hard and has come to IMON International to request a loan that will allow him to purchase young bulls to raise and sell in his area.<P>\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:<P>\r\n\r\n<B>Tajikistan<\/B><BR>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history and diverse culture, which is a mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet influence, and Central Asian traditions. It served as a key post along the Silk Road and marked the end of Alexander the Great's extensive rule. It was the birthplace of the great Persian poet Rudaki and famous Islamic philosopher Ibn Sina. And it is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.<P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\n<B>IMON's History<\/B><BR>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services

S. is married with six children, adults and younger, who live with him. He works in the agriculture and livestock industry. His strength is in raising livestock, but he is dedicated to cultivating his crops through fumigation and care in order to obtain a good harvest.

He seeks support from IMON International to help him move his business forward. With your help, Zaini can get ahead.<P>\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan<BR>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history and diverse culture, which is a mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet influence, and Central Asian traditions. It served as a key post along the Silk Road and marked the end of Alexander the Great's extensive rule. It was the birthplace of the great Persian poet Rudaki and famous Islamic philosopher Ibn Sina. And it is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.<P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<BR>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":295049,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase

Kholjigit has been dedicated to the business of cattle ranching for the last 10 years. This business requires a lot of dedication due to the fact that is demands a lot of effort to carry out the breeding. This is also true because it requires the strict control of every one of the animals and at the same time feeding and caring for those that are older. It is necessary to emphasize that through this business Kholjigit is able to maintain his spouse and six children. It is because of this he his soliciting a loan through IMON International. The credit will allow him to be buy more animals, which he will raise and sell in the market.\r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It's also known for its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

is a married father of two kids \u2013 daughter Zhanetta and son Yuryi. His family lives in Vinogradovo, Western Ukraine. To support his family, Yuryi runs a fishing gear sales business in the central market of his home town. There are very few other entrepreneurs working in this sphere of trade. Yuryi has been running this venture for 7 years already. Presently, he has 20,000 Grivnas in inventory. His net profit amounts to 3,500 Grivnas a month. \r\n\r\nOne of Yuryi\u2019s plans is to open one more vending location in Vinogradovo.

The group members are involved in a variety of businesses and will use their loans for different purposes. Several women raise small animals (like chickens, guinea pigs or sheep) and will use the money to buy more animals or fatten up animals they already have; two women have market stands, where they sell different varieties of potatoes, corn and beans, and will buy sacks of potatoes to sell; one man is a taxi driver and will use his loan for car repair; another is an electrician and will use his loan to buy more tools and materials; one woman makes prepared meals, which she sells in a local market, and will buy vegetables and a sack of rice; another woman knits sweaters and tablecloths and will use the loan money to buy thread and yarn; and another woman makes dental prosthetics, and will use the money to buy more materials for her work. \r\n\r\nThis is the group\u2019s second loan cycle with Asociacion Arariwa.

Rosa De Yanahuapa Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The Santa Rosa de Yanahuapa Village Bank is a newly formed group, and is just beginning its first loan cycle with Asociacion Arariwa. The group members are all neighbors from Yanahuapa, a small town about fifteen minutes outside of the city of Urubamba, in the Sacred Valley. Though this is Santa Rosa de Yanahuapa's first loan from Arariwa, many of the group members have previously participated in group loans, either through Arariwa or through other local financial institutions. \r\n\r\nAt the group's inauguration on March 26th, there was a warm, friendly atmosphere. After singing Peru's national anthem, the group members ate a celebratory inaugural meal of chicken, baked potatoes, corn and cheese in a spicy cilantro sauce, joking and laughing together all the while. The group's loan officer, Alfredo L\u00f3pez, told the group that the seed capital they are receiving now may seem like very little, but soon their investments will bear fruit, and that single seed will produce 200, 500, or even 1000 seeds. \r\n\r\nThe group members are involved in a variety of businesses: they work as artisans, raising livestock or small animals like guinea pigs, growing grains, vegetables and flowers, as grocery store owners, and making and selling chicha, a traditional Andean alcoholic drink made from fermented corn. \r\n\r\nThe group's president, Juan Gualberto A. G., teaches at the local school and also buys and sells cattle as an extra source of income. He currently has three Brown Swiss cows, and is feeding them so that he can sell them for a higher price. He plans to use his loan to buy seed to plant more grass for his cattle. This is Gualberto's first group loan, and he hopes to lead the group well in order to help its members get ahead in life and expand their businesses. \"This organization depends on all of us working well,\" he told the group. He reminded them that everyone must attend all of the group's meetings, make payments on time, be punctual and responsible, and show solidarity with the other group members. \r\n\r\nThe Santa Rosa de Yanahuapa group has agreed to work according to these principles and to repay their Kiva loan in full and on time. \r\n\r\nNote: Three people in the photo are not group members.

The financing is for the purchase of materials and fertilizers.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jessica Kaminsky, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":295158,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy farming materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2009-04-03T03:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Wilfredo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":10000,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":37.03,"local_amount":740.73,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T09:48:21Z","rounded_local_amount":745.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35929437,"comment":null},{"amount":40.97,"local_amount":819.48,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:24:49Z","rounded_local_amount":825.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44384452,"comment":null},{"amount":0,"local_amount":0.03,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T09:40:12Z","rounded_local_amount":0.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63112436,"comment":null},{"amount":422,"local_amount":8439.76,"processed_date":"2009-12-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T10:55:59Z","rounded_local_amount":8498.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110600980,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-04-17T00:01:51Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T10:55:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":98335,"name":"Abraham","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Abraham has a viewing and games centre in Benin city, Edo State, Nigeria.

They are all from the city of Masaya and live in the Monimb\u00f3 neighborhood.  They decided to work with Adim because they heard the promotion for poor women with small businesses.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Lourdes  del Socorro is the coordinator of the group. She's a young woman, age 33, married and the mother of a nine year old daughter in elementary school near the market.  After her classes, the daughter helps her mother with her business.  Her business is the sale of perishable goods in the municipal market in the firewood market on the outskirts of the market.  For many years, she's dedicated herself to this activity.  She's known for her association with her mother who sells in the same sector.  The products that she offers include: lettuce, tomatoes, cabbage, carrots, potatoes, etc. (these are the ones that have the most movement en her inventory).\r\n\r\nShe buys in the same market in the wholesale sector.  She buys these products with the other women of her group and in this way she gets the reductions in price.  Her workday begins at 3 am and ends at 3pm.  She has had her own house for a year which she just finished setting up a few months ago.\r\n\r\nHer husband is a market trader but of products like watermelon, melon and bananas.  For some years now, they have sold their products together.  Now she is becoming independent because this way she can buy what she wants with her profit.  He helps her with the house expenses and their daughter's schooling expenses.  She manages her own money and feels she has improved her condition as a person and economically, while having more rights at home.  She says that in Adim, they have learned the value of work and that their business is hers, just like her accomplishments.  All of this motivates her group-mates to fulfill their payment.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Julie Lutz, Kiva

They decided to move the factory to expand it.  Because of this, the workers also moved and so Cristina lost her principal clients.\r\n\r\nSome time later, she also decided to move away from home.  With this move, she saw a source of income if she dedicated herself to the sale of vegetables in the town market.  Because of this, she bought her place four years ago and sells everyday.  A year after beginning this business she thought it would be good if she also took advantage of her time in the afternoon since sometimes the vegetable business is not sufficient. Every afternoon she sells kebabs, grilled chicken, among other dishes, in the principal area near her house.\r\n\r\nShe has been a single mother of 3 kids that are now 20, 18 and 16 years old.

The shop, which is now more than 20 years old, began as a clothing shop.  Along with dressmaking to measurements, she also buys already-made clothing to sell in her house.  Nowadays, selling the purchased clothing generates the greatest income, since the competition from Western products, which are much cheaper, means that the people prefer to buy already made clothing.\r\n\r\nShe began working in a jeans factory for a well-known label.  She left this job when she got the plot of land in the place where she actually lives.  In order to not lose the land, she had to move to live there.

With this loan, Eriberto would like to increase the size of a room since it is small and uncomfortable.  For this reason, he is going to buy construction materials.  He gives thanks to Afodenic for being part of the goals he has achieved.  This is his tenth loan, and he hopes to have the opportunity to continue improving his home for the best. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Anne Rodriguez, Kiva

Sadly, many of the members have had to separate from their partners due to very sad circumstances and become the head of their households with the sole responsibility for the well-being of their children.  They are engaged in various activities; some are artisans, others prepare and sell meals.  Viviana makes and repairs hats and others weave blankets.  They all have hopes that their businesses will grow and that is why they are requesting greater loans in order to buy raw materials and ingredients.  They also have the confidence that they will have greater sales and consequently greater earnings in order to improve their quality of life.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Daniel Kvaka,

building materials for continued construction of his house. He liked Microinvest's loan conditions, and since he has a business he decided to request a loan for its development. Abdufatto is 51 years old, married, and has five children. His business is in the city's top restaurant, where he rents the bar. Two people work at the bar (the vendor is in the picture). Abdufatto hopes that the loan will allow him to further develop the business, and that he will be able to continue to receive loans in the future. \r\n\r\n  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian

is a 21-year-old single man who lives in jalalabad of Ningarhar province, . He is the only breadwinner in a family of eight members. His father was a farmer, but he is now 60 years old and can not working more.\n\nDawlat graduated from high school last year but was unable to pursue higher education, due to financial problems. His father was very weak, and his family needed someone to support them. Dawlat was brave enough to assume this responsibility and decided to start a small business.

Considering the economic crisis we are facing today, Mrs. P. works very hard cooking in her carenderia in order to earn the money her family needs to survive. Fortunately, the daily consumption needs of her family are met because of the carenderia. Paglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative is a big help to her family and business. She has availed loans several times. Now, she applies for PHP 7,000 to buy additional meats, fishes, and spices for her carenderia.

She buys old and broken trailers that hitch to Soviet-style pickup trucks, and her husband repairs  and resells them. These are used often to transport a variety of goods between provinces. \r\n<p>\r\nThey pay 1.5-2.5 million tugrigs (1,500 tugrigs=$1 USD) per broken trailer, and then repair them with new tires and other modifications. The fixed-up trailers fetch 5-7 million tugrigs. Repairing one trailer takes around 2-3 months. With their profits, Enhtuya and her husband built their own summer house last year. In the future, she would like to insulate her house better against the harsh Mongolian winter.

The family sought a better life.\r\n<p>\r\nAfter the move, Dariymaa started a small retail shop selling engines for Korean cars in the Ogoomor market, one of the large outside markets in Ulaanbaatar. In 2006, she bought her first large container to keep her inventory at the market (it is common for retail stall owners here to use cargo containers as makeshift warehouses, and even stores).
