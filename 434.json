A. is from the village of Lilingayon, Valencia City, Bukidnon. She is 40 years old, separated from her spouse, and has two adult-aged children. To make a living, Violeta owns and operates a specialized retail store selling dresses, t-shirts and ready-to-wear products in the local community. Violeta has been engaged in her business for over ten years and earns approximately 8,500 PHP per month from these activities.\r\n<br>In 2007, Violeta joined Kiva partner, HSPFI, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from HSPFI. This loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Violeta is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. This loan will be her sixth from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About HSPFI<\/b><br>\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.

To make a living, Janeth owns and operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop selling both food and daily use products in the local community. Janeth has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 9,500 PHP per month from these activities.\r\n<br>In 2009, Janeth joined Kiva partner, HSPFI, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from HSPFI. This loan was used to invest in expanding the business. Janeth is requesting a new loan of 13,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. This loan will be her fourth from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About HSPFI<\/b><br>\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

H\u00f3a.  H\u00f3a is the group leader of a 3-member group loan offered by Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.  The official name of this borrowing group is 04.09.04-Li\u00ean Minh -Ho\u1eb1ng Tr\u01b0\u1eddng- Ho\u1eb1ng h\u00f3a (04.09.04-Li\u00ean Minh -Ho\u1eb1ng Tr\u01b0\u1eddng- Ho\u1eb1ng h\u00f3a).\r\n\r\n\r\nH\u00f3a is married and has 3 school-age children.  To making a living, H\u00f3a operates a family member's business venture in the services sector operating a service-based business. The main source of income for the business comes primarily from providing repair services to local community members.  H\u00f3a has been engaged in this business for over 4 years and earns approximately 5000000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2009, H\u00f3a joined Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  H\u00f3a has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3079800 VND from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  This previous loan was used to purchase materials needed to provide service.  She is now requesting a new loan of 6000000 VND which will be used to purchase materials needed to expand services provided.  The loan will be her 2nd loan taken from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  H\u00f3a plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the Other Borrowers in the Group:\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

Fresh produce, milk, and staples such as rice, lentils, and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home.  Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margins.  By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability.  While a typical pasal might be no more than 100 sq. feet, they are always full of bargaining customers, incoming produce, and shrewd businesswomen. This loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.

Cows are never raised for beef, but for their milk from which curd (duy) and fresh cheese (paneer) are made.  Jersey cows are the preferred breed for milking.  On average, a dairy cow in Nepal will produce about 10 liters of milk each day.  In the local market, a liter of milk sells for about USD $0.50.  In addition to producing milk, cows provide dung that is used in home construction, as fuel for fires, and can be captured in methane storage tanks.  The purchase of a dairy cow, made possible through a Kiva loan, is an investment that will repay itself many times over.  This loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.

is 49 year-old Shanti C..  She is married and has 3 children aged 28, 25, and 20.  \r\n\r\nIn 1998, she established  her small store business.  Working 7 days a week and 8 hours a day, she supoorts her family.  She has already received and successfully repaid 5 loans from Patan BPW and used her most recent to purchase additional inventory for her small store. In the future, Shanti plans to continue adding inventory and expanding her business.  She thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\nIn the Kathmandu Valley, the small grocery store, called a pasal, is an important part of the local economy.  Fresh produce, milk, and staples such as rice, lentils, and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home.  Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margains.  By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability.  While a typical pasal might be no more than 100 sq. feet, they are always full of bargaining customers, incoming produce, and shrewd businesswomen. \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.  Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women.  In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.  \r\n\r\nFor more information about Patan BPW, visit our partner

Gulbahor is a hard-working woman who is married and has four children. For the past three years, she has made a living selling office supplies and children's clothing. She started her business after her husband lost his job at a construction company and bills started to pile up. She likes her work, has developed a stable business, and is applying for a loan for $3,000 to buy new items to sell. Success is important to her family's well-being, which is why she hopes that Kiva lenders will be able to support her. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Jori is dedicated to agricultural work, which is the only income he has to support his family.  In his family he has his wife and 7 children. He has been dedicated to this business for several years and over time he has gained experience in cultivating crops. Today Jori has come to IMON International with the proposition of obtaining a loan to purchase seeds and fertilizer for planting. It is necessary to point out that in order to carry out the first planting you need to purchase the supplies and it is for this reason that Jori is confident that his loan request will be successfully granted and he will achieve his objective of having a good harvest to improve his economic situation.   \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The business is now stable and generates the main income for Najmiddin\u2019s family allowing them all to improve their living conditions.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She is married and has 2 children, who are not in school.  For less than a year, Betty has operated a business selling snacks, such as fish and chips. To help expand her business, Betty is requesting a loan of 200,000 UGX from BRAC Uganda, which she will use to buy oil for cooking.  Betty hopes that the loan will help her by allowing her to add more capital to her business. In the future, Betty hopes to own a big shop.\r\n\r\nNote to lenders:\r\nBRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product to Kiva that funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan.\r\n\r\nThe ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills. Afterward, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses. These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance.\r\n\r\nKiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in microfinance.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":573790,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","use":"to buy

Afterward, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses. These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance.\r\n\r\nKiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in microfinance.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":573804,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","use":"to buy

N. is 20 years old and lives in the town of Kalerwe in the Kampala eastern region of Uganda.  She is married and has 3 children, all of whom are in school.  Rehema has operated a business selling food (matooke) for less than one year. Matooke is a meal consisting of steamed green banana and is one of the national dishes of Uganda. To help expand her business, Rehema is requesting a loan of 150,000 UGX from BRAC Uganda, which she will use to buy more matooke. Rehema hopes that the loan will help her by allowing her to expand in her business. In the future, Rehema hopes to see her children study up to university.\r\n\r\nNote to lenders:\r\nBRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product to Kiva that funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan.\r\n\r\nThe ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills. Afterward, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses. These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance.\r\n\r\nKiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in microfinance.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":75,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":75,"image":{"id":573819,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

N. is 21 years old and lives in the town of Kalerwe in the Kampala east region of Uganda. She is married and has one child, who is not in school. Milly has a business selling phone air time, which she has had for two years. \r\n<p>\r\nTo help expand her business, Milly is requesting a loan of 100,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more air time for selling. Milly hopes that the loan will help her by allowing her to add more capital to her business. In the future, Milly hopes to open up another business (a saloon).\r\n<p>\r\nNote to lenders:\r\nBRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product to Kiva that funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan.\r\n<p>\r\nThe ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills. Afterwards, ELA participants can receive micro-finance loans to expand their small businesses. These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional micro-finance.\r\n<p>\r\nKiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising

G. is a 50-year-old married woman who supports her family by operating a weaving  business. She lives in the municipality of Bogo, Argao, Cebu. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2005 and has improved her living conditions through her own hard work and with the help of her loans from NWTF. \n\nBy working hard in her  weaving  business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 9600. Editha is now borrowing PHP 16000 to add to her working capital. This is her ninth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 15000, which she repaid well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Editha wants to improve her family's living conditions and to ensure their future well being by following the Dungganon way. \n\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

S. is a married woman who lives in Prk. Malipayon, Brgy. Banago, Bacolod City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  a general store and a pig fattening business. Her husband, Roel S., who is 47 years old, works as a driver to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have four children who are 9 to 14 years old. \r\n\r\nAntonieta joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2010 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Antonieta has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. The additional working capital from her previous loan of PHP 5,000 helped her increase her monthly profit to PHP 10,000, improving the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her second loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000, which she intends to use as additional capital to buy more stock for her general store so that she can continue to save for the future and send her children to school. Antonieta S. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

She is also a provider to some businesses in the district. \r\n\r\nThis business is very profitable because everyone prefers to purchase chicken from her, given the high prices for other types of meat in the market. \r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan to purchae more chickens, destined for resale.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Erika Lindig, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1525,"image":{"id":573847,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase chickens.

N. Florence, a hardworking, dependable and lively 42-year-old woman, was not one to be left out of this lucrative opportunity which presented itself in her home area of Kibaati, Mubende. She made a decision to capitalize on it and, with the money she had saved doing her other businesses, she bought her first bales of second-hand clothes. \r\n<br>With these she established her business. Although the business has had its fair share of ups and downs, Florence has emerged as a resilient lady who has refused to buckle under pressure.

She buys bales of second-hand clothes from traders in Nabugabo Road in Kampala city. She uses public transport to and from the traders and visits them once every two weeks.

She lives with her husband and the youngest of their children.\r\n\r\nSix years ago, she decided to exploit as much as possible the resources she has in her land, which is rich in clay.  This was very good for making bricks.  Since then she has mass-produced them.  She also needed to hire labor, especially people who are experts in brickmaking.  As for marketing, she takes care of it herself, offering her bricks for sale at several places in the city.  She sells on average 20,000 bricks per month, which helps her cover family expenses.  She says her business is profitable because there is high demand for bricks; for this reason she plans to buy more clay-rich land in the future so she can continue making more bricks. \r\n\r\nThis is Francisca's tenth loan with MFP.  She is very happy to know that she has financial support since she has always shown herself to be responsible about her payments.

She has a place close to her house where she has her own clothing store, which she has gradually developed over time.

With this loan, she will make her store look better and be able to offer more options to her customers, who say that they are very satisfied with the new store.\r\n\r\nShe is a member of the communal bank \"Manantial de Santa Fe,\" one of the 100 organizations that are members of EDESA in Costa Rica.

The main economic activities here are livestock and agriculture, particularly the cultivation of staple grains and oranges.\r\n\r\nOldemar and his family have always worked in livestock production, with the dual objective of producing meat and milk.  He comments that it is a very good business, since the demand is sufficiently high in his community, and today his products sell at a good price, particularly the milk.\r\n\r\nNow Oldemar wants to take out a micro-loan of 618,000 Costa Rican colones, to buy 2 cows that he knows well.  These cows are pregnant, and this will allow him to profit by selling their milk at a good price. \r\n\r\nOldemar is part of the communal bank \"Rapicr\u00e9dito Progreso Futuro Coquital,\" one of the 100 organizations that are members of EDESA in Costa Rica.  This will be his first loan, and with it he hopes to improve his business every day.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva

She has 25 years of experience in the diverse activities of a farm, and at the same time, she runs a store.  Generally, she and her family work more in agriculture.  They plant potatoes and corn so that they always have these available for daily consumption.  They also raise animals together: cows and sheep.  This is how she distributes her time, in order to find satisfaction in her work.  She is always receiving help from her children and husband.\r\n\r\nIn the future, she would like to increase her crops by planting on more land, and also to have a better-stocked store.  This is her fourteenth loan with Microfinanzas Prisma.  She is very pleased to know that she has financial support, and she has always shown herself to be responsible with her repayments.  She is also grateful to be part of a communal bank because all of her fellow members are responsible people who are dedicated to the group.  She is grateful to those people who will be managing the loan she is requesting, as it will be very useful in the progress of her business.  She will use the requested loan to buy a cow of the criollo breed, and also to buy more products to stock her store.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Katie Kavanagh, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":574052,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy products to stock her store, and also to buy a cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-08-03T07:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":725,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:05:12Z","rounded_local_amount":2047.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188724962,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-08-06T19:41:19Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T14:05:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":217806,"name":"Angela Del Carmen","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\u00c1ngela del Carmen tiene 2 hijos menores de edad, por lo que siempre esa pendiente de lo que necesitan.

Por La Vida Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The communal bank \u201cLuchadores por la Vida\u201d is composed of 21 members from the city of Talca. They are involved in artisan crafts, hairstyling, clothes and underwear sales, restaurants, and sewing.\r\nNorma is the group\u2019s president. In the photo she is in the first row on the left side wearing a red jacket and a pink scarf, with short hair. She sells American clothing. At weekends she sells in the flea market which is close to her home. She also sells from home and at different sites around and outside of Talca. She has been in this business for three years, and has support from her oldest son and her husband, who help her find places to sell and transport her clothing. Norma has three children but only lives with her daughter who is 17, as her other two children live with their own families. \r\nNorma will invest this loan into a much larger quantity of clothing to sell. Her dream is to grow her business and to set up a store in her home from which to sell. Norma enjoys working with Kiva partner, Fondo Esperanza, because she feels that the group members are responsible and committed.  Additionally, the workshops about business administration have helped her.\r\nTalca is in the Maule region, located in the central part of Chile. The majority of the population live in rural areas, and dedicate themselves primarily to productive farming activities. Talca is known for its beautiful artisan products and its colonial architecture. The principal attractions are the plants, animals, and vineyards. Despite the fact that the workforce has increased, this region continues to be, according to the latest census, one of the poorest in the country.\r\n"}},"status":"deleted","funded_amount":3400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":574049,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used

This way of working allows her to arrange her schedule and not neglect her children.\r\n\r\nThe most difficult part of her work is waiting for her customers to pay her.

However, she is very constant when it comes to her embroideries, as their complexity and thickness on the fabric take a month's work. The end result is a beautiful traditional garment, admired by her customers, who buy in cash.

She lives with her three children in their own house. For the last ten years she has had a grocery store which helps her with her other businesses: raising crops and animals. She works every day selling her products in the store and her children help her in their free time. Each week she buys more merchandise so that she always has a store full of products that her customers want to buy. This work allows her to improve her economic status little by little and she is appreciative for each day she can do this commercial activity. Her store is a good complement to the work she does in agriculture and raising animals. In the future she would like to develop her store so that she can have a larger and more well stocked store. This is her thirteenth loan with MFP. She is very content knowing that she has financial support. She has always paid her payments responsibly. She is grateful to be a part of a community group as all of the members of the group are responsible and supportive people. With this loan that she is requesting she will buy merchandise for her store. She would also like to buy sacks of fertilizer in order to grow grasses that are used for food for the animals. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Esther Levandoski, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":574108,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase products for her store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-08-01T16:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luisa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1075}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1075,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:03:53Z","rounded_local_amount":3035.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188724971,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-08-06T17:31:49Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T14:03:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":217837,"name":"Martina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Martina tiene 39 a\u00f1os, vive con sus padres y sus 3 hijos en su casa propia.

Venus, Brgy. Patao, Bantayan, Cebu. She earns her living by operating three business ventures: buying and selling dried fish, buying and selling ready-to-wear clothes and raising hogs. She has eight children who range from 7 to 30 years old. \r\n\r\nVirginia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1999 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 18 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Virginia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 25,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 19th loan cycle, she is borrowing PHP 25,000, which she intends to use as additional capital for her dried fish business so that she can continue to save up for the future for the education of her children. Virginia P. is a Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\") woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b> In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon. Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

K. is 49 years old and single. She has two children, ages 21 and 18. Her business office is located at Moi Avenue on a very busy street in the city center in Nairobi and is well-known by the name Malex Properties. She does real estate and builds stalls to rent out to business people. She has been in this business for the last five years, and she says the business is profitable. She says that the business is very good, and the only major challenge she has is convincing the customers that they will make income to pay the stall's rent.

K. is 30 years old, married, and has two children aged five months and five years old. Her business is located at Imenti House, a very busy building in Nairobi city centre. Cesily sells suits, shirts and ties to male customers within the city centre. Most of her customers are walk-ins although she also has some loyal repeat customers. \r\n<br>Cesily has been in this business for the last four months and says that business is very good and profitable. The only major challenge she has is that there are so many people in the area operating the same kind of business so customers are spoiled for choice.

Because of its profits, she has been able to support her family\u2019s needs. Being a good mother, Helen has always wanted to support her children in whatever career they would be taking to better their own personal life.  Aside from Helen\u2019s fishing business, financed by the loan she received from ASHI, she also has a farming business.  This is her way of saving her profits to support the needs of her family, especially to pay for her children\u2019s education until college.\r\n\r\nHer husband\u2019s support of her fishing business is Helen\u2019s inspiration to keep growing her business despite the challenges of poverty.  Over time, Helen has been able to purchase a fishing boat for her husband to manage and use for fishing.  Meanwhile, Helen is the one who sells his fish directly to people in local community and nearby town of Jala-jala, Rizal.\r\n\r\nWith that, Helen is requesting a loan from Kiva lenders to be able to purchase additional fishing equipment to catch more fish to sell and support the maintenance of her family's farming business. This would help their business grow, and make more profit, which will enable her to support her ambition in life.\r\n\r\nHelen has been an ASHI member since 2005. Her family is very thankful that she has an opportunity to improve their standard of living through the income of the fishing and fish selling businesses she has established with the support of the loans she has requested.\r\n\r\nThe attached picture of Helen was taken July 14,2010 with her supportive husband, Jesus S.

is a young mother who aims to become successful someday by developing her farming business. Her husband works as an OFW (Overseas Contract Worker), and together they work for the future of their family. Barselisa is thankful to Kiva partner, ASHI, for the loans it has provided since 2005. Berselisa has been able to support her farm by purchasing fertilizers, rice seeds and other supplies, and hopes to further improve her crop production in the future through hard work and the continuous assistance of ASHI. \r\n<br>Lack of business capital encouraged Barselisa to seek the financial support of Kiva lenders. She will be glad if her loan request is granted and she will use the loan wisely by purchasing necessary agricultural supplies to maintain crop production. Her hard work and patience are her foundation in achieving a better life. In addition, the income Barselisa gets from her business is very helpful in supporting her business and sustaining the needs of her family, especially in providing school allowances for her two children. \r\n<br>Someday, Barselisa hopes to expand her farming business. She is glad for the secured opportunity of taking this loan and for your support and encouragement. Her long-term goal is to achieve a level of rice production so that she can give opportunity of employment to others, especially her extended relatives in her barangay (village). Berselisa hopes to maintain a long-term, sustainable farming business.
